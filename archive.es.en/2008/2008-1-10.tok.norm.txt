in the letter , merkel is praised by the organizations for setting up the integration summit to promote dialogue with migrant groups .
but they go on to find fault with her staunch support for koch .
" in place of the open , constructive talks and objective solutions needed , they are causing considerable damage with their election rhetoric , " the letter states .
the victim protection group weisser ring , however , criticized the immigrant groups for downplaying the seriousness and extent of the attacks . " the current problems are the tip of the iceberg , " hans-dieter schwind , the organization 's head , told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
" if they are not deal with preventively as well as repressively , they will bother us for decades . "
the hesse premier used a much publicized attack by two greek and turkish youths on a german pensioner at a munich subway train last month to call for tougher punishment for young delinquents and deportation of non- german offenders .
coalition partners at loggerheads over the tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant groups say populist political tactics will harm integration efforts the cdu leadership backed the state premier 's call , while its social democratic coalition partner accused it of " populism " and said existing laws were sufficient to deal with the issue .
the groups rejected deportation as a tool to deal with the crime problem .
they said it was not right hat " responsibility for the problems that have been created in our country should be offloaded on to the country where the parents or the grandparents came from . "
they also said high crime levels among young migrants were a result of their social rather than their ethnic background , and demanded equal access to education and professional training .
kenan kolat , the head of the turkish community in germany , has called on voters of turkish origin not to vote for the premier .
he accused koch of " fanning racist resentment in society . "
" we must not pave the way for political arsonists , " he said .
cdu in hesse partly responsible for problem ?

" quality is more important than speed , " topolanek said after the news conference .
but he added that the ideal scenario would be to submit the treaties to parliament after the nato summit in bucharest in april .
tusk said poland was not trying to stall the talks until after the us presidential election .
" we are neither trying to speed up , or slow down the talks , " he said .
but the polish pm reiterated that his country was not willing to strike a deal until it receives guarantees from the us that it would boost poland 's defenses .
new polish government more wary of missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk is proving a harder bargaining partner his new center-right government has taken a tougher line towards washington in the negotiations than the administration under conservative pm jaroslaw kaczynski .
after taking power in november , tusk expressed disappointment that the us side had been unable to overcome russian opposition to the missile shield plan .

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

" confusing applications " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceremonies at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem remember holocaust victims holocaust survivor organizations in israel have said that many eligible candidates misunderstood the application form and mistakenly ticked a box reading : " i was forced to do the work . " chen yurista , the director of the conference on jewish material claims against germany in tel aviv , told dpa that some ghetto survivors felt they had no choice but to volunteer for work , as they otherwise faced death .
they therefore felt that they were coerced . yurista said his organization had received numerous phone calls from confused applicants , who were then told that the lump compensation sums are reserved for voluntary work . albig , on the other hand , said nobody 's application had been turned down in the processing that the finance ministry has done so far .
he stressed that if the box appeared to have been incorrectly ticked , officials would contact the applicant . forms could be rewritten he also said that german and israeli officials were discussing how to reword the application form to make the question clearer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names inside the holocaust history museum at yad vashem " obviously , the fund qualification rules are n't meant to imply that people were living in the ghetto voluntarily , " albig told dpa .
" they were all there by compulsion and that in itself was a dreadful crime . " ghetto survivors have lamented that only few were able to obtain normal german old-age pensions based on their employment history during the war .
after intense diplomatic pressure and a public outcry , the german government announced the fund last september . dpa reported that around 50,000 ghetto survivors around the world are believed to be eligible for the compensation , with half of them living in israel . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

in the letter , merkel is praised by the organizations for setting up the integration summit to promote dialogue with migrant groups .
but they go on to find fault with her staunch support for koch .
" in place of the open , constructive talks and objective solutions needed , they are causing considerable damage with their election rhetoric , " the letter states .
the victim protection group weisser ring , however , criticized the immigrant groups for downplaying the seriousness and extent of the attacks . " the current problems are the tip of the iceberg , " hans-dieter schwind , the organization 's head , told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
" if they are not deal with preventively as well as repressively , they will bother us for decades . "
the hesse premier used a much publicized attack by two greek and turkish youths on a german pensioner at a munich subway train last month to call for tougher punishment for young delinquents and deportation of non- german offenders .
coalition partners at loggerheads over the tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant groups say populist political tactics will harm integration efforts the cdu leadership backed the state premier 's call , while its social democratic coalition partner accused it of " populism " and said existing laws were sufficient to deal with the issue .
the groups rejected deportation as a tool to deal with the crime problem .
they said it was not right hat " responsibility for the problems that have been created in our country should be offloaded on to the country where the parents or the grandparents came from . "
they also said high crime levels among young migrants were a result of their social rather than their ethnic background , and demanded equal access to education and professional training .
kenan kolat , the head of the turkish community in germany , has called on voters of turkish origin not to vote for the premier .
he accused koch of " fanning racist resentment in society . "
" we must not pave the way for political arsonists , " he said .
cdu in hesse partly responsible for problem ?

9 , that his state was the slowest when it came to dealing with youth crime cases .
this has led to further criticism that cuts made by koch 's government were partly to blame for the problem . apart from backing from merkel and other conservative party members , the premier has found support for his campagin from the far-right national democratic party .
party president udo voigt said the npd would benefit from koch 's stance .
" when established politicians adopt the npd 's arguments , it will lead to more citizens placing their trust in the policies of the npd and as a result vote for the npd , " voigt said in berlin on tuesday , dec .
8 .
the president of germany 's national council of jews , charlotte knobloch , has warned that highlighting the ethnicity of suspected criminals might play into the hands of neo-nazi campaigners .
she said crimes committed by youths with an immigrant background were " a welcome argument " for npd functionaries to call into question the right of foreigners to live in germany .
the npd is represented in the state parliaments of saxony and mecklenburg-western pomerania , both in the former communist east of germany .
it won 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last national elections in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .
" we believe we in northern ireland have a contribution to make .
we believe there is room for innovation and growth in northern ireland and we are very grateful for the continued support we get from the commission . "
eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .
however , northern ireland no longer has objective one status - the term given to regions of the eu which qualify for the most support from brussels .
barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" quality is more important than speed , " topolanek said after the news conference .

tusk said poland was not trying to stall the talks until after the us presidential election .
" we are neither trying to speed up , or slow down the talks , " he said .

warsaw decided to talk directly to moscow about the us administration 's proposals to deploy 10 missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic .

" quality is more important than speed , " topolanek said after the news conference .
but he added that the ideal scenario would be to submit the treaties to parliament after the nato summit in bucharest in april .
tusk said poland was not trying to stall the talks until after the us presidential election .
" we are neither trying to speed up , or slow down the talks , " he said .
but the polish pm reiterated that his country was not willing to strike a deal until it receives guarantees from the us that it would boost poland 's defenses .
new polish government more wary of missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk is proving a harder bargaining partner his new center-right government has taken a tougher line towards washington in the negotiations than the administration under conservative pm jaroslaw kaczynski .
after taking power in november , tusk expressed disappointment that the us side had been unable to overcome russian opposition to the missile shield plan .
warsaw decided to talk directly to moscow about the us administration 's proposals to deploy 10 missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic .
and high-level talks have been taking place today in warsaw between polish and russian government officials .
moscow said russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak wanted to make poland aware in his talks with chief missile defense negotiator witold waszczykowski and top diplomat radek sikorski of the " risks of the proposed system " and " help it to recognize the problems for its own strategic security . "
us officials say the system would protect the united states and its allies from attacks by states , such as iran and north korea , or a terrorist organization .
but moscow says the central european part of the shield would threaten its security and upset the balance of military power in europe . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the treaty aims to simplify customs and border checks , according to the china daily .
" barring any complications , a scheduled container train should be shuttling between china and germany in a year 's time , " said zheng mingli , chairman of china railway container transport , according to the report .
the route , which will link beijing and hamburg , is expected to boost trade and cargo flows between the two continents and would allow goods to be delivered in a record 18 days .
currently , delivery of cargo by sea between the two destinations takes about 40 days .
" investments will pay off " a test container train carrying a load of chinese goods , including electrical appliances , clothes , shoes and ceramic tiles , rolled out of beijing on wednesday and is expected to arrive in hamburg in 18 days .
the train will travel through the mongolian republic and the trans siberian railway via belarus and poland before making its way to the port city of hamburg .
flagging off the test cargo train in beijing , hartmut mehdorn , ceo of german rail deutsche bahn , said the transport axis between asia and europe has never been more important in light of booming economic growth in asia and russia .
" deutsche bahn has recognized the trend early .
those are investments that will in the long-term pay off for germany 's economy , " mehdorn said .
" today , we 're inaugurating a further important step in the realization of a common eurasian bridge , " he said .
german train technology is already well known in china .
china currently operates the world 's only commercial german-built maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district .

" if these kinds of things continue , and i am a hundred percent sure that this is continuing , then we ca n't recognize " the election , he said , adding that he would " continue protests and everything under the constitution " to oppose incumbent president mikhail saakashvili .

saakashvili imposed a 15-day state of emergency to put a stop to the violence and closed down the main opposition television station , imedi . he later agreed to the early elections as part of concessions to the opposition , which accuse him of ruling in an autocratic style . but the unrest and emergency rule tarnished his reputation as one of the most democratic and reformist leaders in the former soviet union .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after the peaceful , pro-western rose revolution . shortly after becoming president , saakashvili engineered a peaceful uprising that overthrew the region 's authoritarian ruler , aslan abashidze , who fled to russia in the face of street protests .

in the letter , merkel is praised by the organizations for setting up the integration summit to promote dialogue with migrant groups .
but they go on to find fault with her staunch support for koch .
" in place of the open , constructive talks and objective solutions needed , they are causing considerable damage with their election rhetoric , " the letter states .
the victim protection group weisser ring , however , criticized the immigrant groups for downplaying the seriousness and extent of the attacks . " the current problems are the tip of the iceberg , " hans-dieter schwind , the organization 's head , told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
" if they are not deal with preventively as well as repressively , they will bother us for decades . "
the hesse premier used a much publicized attack by two greek and turkish youths on a german pensioner at a munich subway train last month to call for tougher punishment for young delinquents and deportation of non- german offenders .
coalition partners at loggerheads over the tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant groups say populist political tactics will harm integration efforts the cdu leadership backed the state premier 's call , while its social democratic coalition partner accused it of " populism " and said existing laws were sufficient to deal with the issue .
the groups rejected deportation as a tool to deal with the crime problem .
they said it was not right hat " responsibility for the problems that have been created in our country should be offloaded on to the country where the parents or the grandparents came from . "
they also said high crime levels among young migrants were a result of their social rather than their ethnic background , and demanded equal access to education and professional training .
kenan kolat , the head of the turkish community in germany , has called on voters of turkish origin not to vote for the premier .
he accused koch of " fanning racist resentment in society . "
" we must not pave the way for political arsonists , " he said .

9 , that his state was the slowest when it came to dealing with youth crime cases .
this has led to further criticism that cuts made by koch 's government were partly to blame for the problem . apart from backing from merkel and other conservative party members , the premier has found support for his campagin from the far-right national democratic party .
party president udo voigt said the npd would benefit from koch 's stance .
" when established politicians adopt the npd 's arguments , it will lead to more citizens placing their trust in the policies of the npd and as a result vote for the npd , " voigt said in berlin on tuesday , dec .
8 .
the president of germany 's national council of jews , charlotte knobloch , has warned that highlighting the ethnicity of suspected criminals might play into the hands of neo-nazi campaigners .
she said crimes committed by youths with an immigrant background were " a welcome argument " for npd functionaries to call into question the right of foreigners to live in germany .
the npd is represented in the state parliaments of saxony and mecklenburg-western pomerania , both in the former communist east of germany .

5 , were showing conflicting results , favoring either the incumbent president saakashvili or his main opponent , levan gachechiladze . an opinion poll carried on saturday evening by television channels loyal to the government showed president mikhail saakashvili in the lead with 52.5 percent of votes . " this clearly indicates the elections were successful and the next president of georgia is mikhail saakashvili , " campaign manager davit bakradze told afp .
" we call on all our opponents to accept the results of this election . " however , in a survey published by a ukrainian pollster after polling stations closed , saakashvili only got some 24.4 percent of votes , well behind opposition candidate levan gachechiladze with 31 percent , interfax news agency reported . preliminary results are expected by sunday . problematic campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands have protested saakashvili 's government since november saturday 's elections in the former soviet republic were marred by accusations of vote rigging made against the government .
gachechiladze told reporters on friday that a series of violations - including media coercion and misappropriation of public funds - plagued the campaign leading to the election , adding that he was considering not recognizing the presidential poll 's results . " if these kinds of things continue , and i am a hundred percent sure that this is continuing , then we ca n't recognize " the election , he said , adding that he would " continue protests and everything under the constitution " to oppose incumbent president mikhail saakashvili . " we can not give saakashvili our country and our population , because we are 100 percent sure that if he proceeds with falsified elections , we will get an authoritarian regime here very soon , " gachechiladze said after meeting with european election observers . election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a december report that they had received information indicating some claims of unequal campaign conditions , intimidation and vote buying . objectivity in 2nd round of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gachechiladze , left , is saakashvili 's main opponent last weekend , some 30,000 protesters took to the streets to demonstrate their anger over what they called an unfair five-week campaign .
accusing the president of wielding too much authority , gachechiladze said , if elected , he would give more power to parliament . david gamkrelidze of the conservative new rights party , also threatened on friday not to recognize the vote and to use " all peaceful methods " to protest the result . gamkrelidze told reporters that saakashvili did not have enough support to overcome the 50-percent threshold , which is necessary for a win in the first round . " we think the only objective result will be a second round , " he said . if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote on saturday , a second round of voting must take place on jan .
19 between the top two finishers .
a second round face-off would likely pit saakashvili against a single candidate from the fragmented opposition . denying allegations of fixing the election , saakashvili said he was confident he would receive the majority of votes on saturday , but added that he " would also accept any other result . " pair of pro-west candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a harsh crackdown on demonstrators injured georiga 's international reputation both saakashvili and gachechiladze are seen as pro-western politicians who want to move the former soviet republic away from moscow , with which tbilisi has seen relations fall to all-time lows , and toward membership in the european union and the north atlantic treaty organization . " whoever becomes president is going to pursue a euro-atlantic path , because there 's no other path to follow , " amanda akcakoca , an analyst at the european policy center in brussels , told bloomberg news last month . in addition to the presidential election , two non-binding referendums will be held to consult with voters on potential nato membership and the date for the next parliamentary elections . saakashvili 's government pushed economic reforms and sold state assets to increase foreign business in georgia .
in 2007 , according to government estimates , georgia will receive $ 1.5 billion -lrb- 1 billion euros -rrb- in foreign direct investments compared with $ 1 billion in 2006 .
but in november , the international monetary fund said unrest in the country had damaged investors ' confidence . polls commissioned by the seven candidates in saturday 's contest do not present a unified view of expected results , though most analysts believe saakashvili heads the field . not so rosy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's reputation as a democracy is at stake in this election the election is the result of a snap poll called by saakashvili after clashes in november between police and as many as 70,000 protesters .
saakashvili imposed a 15-day state of emergency to put a stop to the violence and closed down the main opposition television station , imedi . he later agreed to the early elections as part of concessions to the opposition , which accuse him of ruling in an autocratic style . but the unrest and emergency rule tarnished his reputation as one of the most democratic and reformist leaders in the former soviet union .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after the peaceful , pro-western rose revolution . shortly after becoming president , saakashvili engineered a peaceful uprising that overthrew the region 's authoritarian ruler , aslan abashidze , who fled to russia in the face of street protests .
saakashvili then cemented his presidential mandate in 2004 , claiming 96 percent of the vote . hundreds of international observers have arrived in georgia for the election and diplomats have warned that georgian efforts at integrating further with the west could be derailed if the vote is not conducted fairly . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .
germany has said it will send up to 200 soldiers and 10 police officers to the region . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

the treaty aims to simplify customs and border checks , according to the china daily .
" barring any complications , a scheduled container train should be shuttling between china and germany in a year 's time , " said zheng mingli , chairman of china railway container transport , according to the report .
the route , which will link beijing and hamburg , is expected to boost trade and cargo flows between the two continents and would allow goods to be delivered in a record 18 days .
currently , delivery of cargo by sea between the two destinations takes about 40 days .
" investments will pay off " a test container train carrying a load of chinese goods , including electrical appliances , clothes , shoes and ceramic tiles , rolled out of beijing on wednesday and is expected to arrive in hamburg in 18 days .
the train will travel through the mongolian republic and the trans siberian railway via belarus and poland before making its way to the port city of hamburg .
flagging off the test cargo train in beijing , hartmut mehdorn , ceo of german rail deutsche bahn , said the transport axis between asia and europe has never been more important in light of booming economic growth in asia and russia .
" deutsche bahn has recognized the trend early .
those are investments that will in the long-term pay off for germany 's economy , " mehdorn said .
" today , we 're inaugurating a further important step in the realization of a common eurasian bridge , " he said .

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .

eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .

barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .
" we believe we in northern ireland have a contribution to make .
we believe there is room for innovation and growth in northern ireland and we are very grateful for the continued support we get from the commission . "
eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .
however , northern ireland no longer has objective one status - the term given to regions of the eu which qualify for the most support from brussels .
barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" confusing applications " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceremonies at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem remember holocaust victims holocaust survivor organizations in israel have said that many eligible candidates misunderstood the application form and mistakenly ticked a box reading : " i was forced to do the work . " chen yurista , the director of the conference on jewish material claims against germany in tel aviv , told dpa that some ghetto survivors felt they had no choice but to volunteer for work , as they otherwise faced death .
they therefore felt that they were coerced . yurista said his organization had received numerous phone calls from confused applicants , who were then told that the lump compensation sums are reserved for voluntary work . albig , on the other hand , said nobody 's application had been turned down in the processing that the finance ministry has done so far .
he stressed that if the box appeared to have been incorrectly ticked , officials would contact the applicant . forms could be rewritten he also said that german and israeli officials were discussing how to reword the application form to make the question clearer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names inside the holocaust history museum at yad vashem " obviously , the fund qualification rules are n't meant to imply that people were living in the ghetto voluntarily , " albig told dpa .

" confusing applications " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceremonies at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem remember holocaust victims holocaust survivor organizations in israel have said that many eligible candidates misunderstood the application form and mistakenly ticked a box reading : " i was forced to do the work . " chen yurista , the director of the conference on jewish material claims against germany in tel aviv , told dpa that some ghetto survivors felt they had no choice but to volunteer for work , as they otherwise faced death .
they therefore felt that they were coerced . yurista said his organization had received numerous phone calls from confused applicants , who were then told that the lump compensation sums are reserved for voluntary work . albig , on the other hand , said nobody 's application had been turned down in the processing that the finance ministry has done so far .
he stressed that if the box appeared to have been incorrectly ticked , officials would contact the applicant . forms could be rewritten he also said that german and israeli officials were discussing how to reword the application form to make the question clearer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names inside the holocaust history museum at yad vashem " obviously , the fund qualification rules are n't meant to imply that people were living in the ghetto voluntarily , " albig told dpa .
" they were all there by compulsion and that in itself was a dreadful crime . " ghetto survivors have lamented that only few were able to obtain normal german old-age pensions based on their employment history during the war .
after intense diplomatic pressure and a public outcry , the german government announced the fund last september . dpa reported that around 50,000 ghetto survivors around the world are believed to be eligible for the compensation , with half of them living in israel . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .

" quality is more important than speed , " topolanek said after the news conference .
but he added that the ideal scenario would be to submit the treaties to parliament after the nato summit in bucharest in april .
tusk said poland was not trying to stall the talks until after the us presidential election .
" we are neither trying to speed up , or slow down the talks , " he said .
but the polish pm reiterated that his country was not willing to strike a deal until it receives guarantees from the us that it would boost poland 's defenses .
new polish government more wary of missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk is proving a harder bargaining partner his new center-right government has taken a tougher line towards washington in the negotiations than the administration under conservative pm jaroslaw kaczynski .
after taking power in november , tusk expressed disappointment that the us side had been unable to overcome russian opposition to the missile shield plan .
warsaw decided to talk directly to moscow about the us administration 's proposals to deploy 10 missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic .
and high-level talks have been taking place today in warsaw between polish and russian government officials .
moscow said russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak wanted to make poland aware in his talks with chief missile defense negotiator witold waszczykowski and top diplomat radek sikorski of the " risks of the proposed system " and " help it to recognize the problems for its own strategic security . "
us officials say the system would protect the united states and its allies from attacks by states , such as iran and north korea , or a terrorist organization .
but moscow says the central european part of the shield would threaten its security and upset the balance of military power in europe . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

" quality is more important than speed , " topolanek said after the news conference .
but he added that the ideal scenario would be to submit the treaties to parliament after the nato summit in bucharest in april .
tusk said poland was not trying to stall the talks until after the us presidential election .
" we are neither trying to speed up , or slow down the talks , " he said .
but the polish pm reiterated that his country was not willing to strike a deal until it receives guarantees from the us that it would boost poland 's defenses .
new polish government more wary of missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk is proving a harder bargaining partner his new center-right government has taken a tougher line towards washington in the negotiations than the administration under conservative pm jaroslaw kaczynski .
after taking power in november , tusk expressed disappointment that the us side had been unable to overcome russian opposition to the missile shield plan .
warsaw decided to talk directly to moscow about the us administration 's proposals to deploy 10 missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic .
and high-level talks have been taking place today in warsaw between polish and russian government officials .
moscow said russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak wanted to make poland aware in his talks with chief missile defense negotiator witold waszczykowski and top diplomat radek sikorski of the " risks of the proposed system " and " help it to recognize the problems for its own strategic security . "
us officials say the system would protect the united states and its allies from attacks by states , such as iran and north korea , or a terrorist organization .
but moscow says the central european part of the shield would threaten its security and upset the balance of military power in europe . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

" confusing applications " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceremonies at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem remember holocaust victims holocaust survivor organizations in israel have said that many eligible candidates misunderstood the application form and mistakenly ticked a box reading : " i was forced to do the work . " chen yurista , the director of the conference on jewish material claims against germany in tel aviv , told dpa that some ghetto survivors felt they had no choice but to volunteer for work , as they otherwise faced death .
they therefore felt that they were coerced . yurista said his organization had received numerous phone calls from confused applicants , who were then told that the lump compensation sums are reserved for voluntary work . albig , on the other hand , said nobody 's application had been turned down in the processing that the finance ministry has done so far .
he stressed that if the box appeared to have been incorrectly ticked , officials would contact the applicant . forms could be rewritten he also said that german and israeli officials were discussing how to reword the application form to make the question clearer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hall of names inside the holocaust history museum at yad vashem " obviously , the fund qualification rules are n't meant to imply that people were living in the ghetto voluntarily , " albig told dpa .

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .

for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .

in the letter , merkel is praised by the organizations for setting up the integration summit to promote dialogue with migrant groups .
but they go on to find fault with her staunch support for koch .
" in place of the open , constructive talks and objective solutions needed , they are causing considerable damage with their election rhetoric , " the letter states .
the victim protection group weisser ring , however , criticized the immigrant groups for downplaying the seriousness and extent of the attacks . " the current problems are the tip of the iceberg , " hans-dieter schwind , the organization 's head , told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
" if they are not deal with preventively as well as repressively , they will bother us for decades . "
the hesse premier used a much publicized attack by two greek and turkish youths on a german pensioner at a munich subway train last month to call for tougher punishment for young delinquents and deportation of non- german offenders .
coalition partners at loggerheads over the tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant groups say populist political tactics will harm integration efforts the cdu leadership backed the state premier 's call , while its social democratic coalition partner accused it of " populism " and said existing laws were sufficient to deal with the issue .
the groups rejected deportation as a tool to deal with the crime problem .
they said it was not right hat " responsibility for the problems that have been created in our country should be offloaded on to the country where the parents or the grandparents came from . "
they also said high crime levels among young migrants were a result of their social rather than their ethnic background , and demanded equal access to education and professional training .
kenan kolat , the head of the turkish community in germany , has called on voters of turkish origin not to vote for the premier .
he accused koch of " fanning racist resentment in society . "
" we must not pave the way for political arsonists , " he said .
cdu in hesse partly responsible for problem ?

9 , that his state was the slowest when it came to dealing with youth crime cases .
this has led to further criticism that cuts made by koch 's government were partly to blame for the problem . apart from backing from merkel and other conservative party members , the premier has found support for his campagin from the far-right national democratic party .
party president udo voigt said the npd would benefit from koch 's stance .
" when established politicians adopt the npd 's arguments , it will lead to more citizens placing their trust in the policies of the npd and as a result vote for the npd , " voigt said in berlin on tuesday , dec .

the president of germany 's national council of jews , charlotte knobloch , has warned that highlighting the ethnicity of suspected criminals might play into the hands of neo-nazi campaigners .
she said crimes committed by youths with an immigrant background were " a welcome argument " for npd functionaries to call into question the right of foreigners to live in germany .
the npd is represented in the state parliaments of saxony and mecklenburg-western pomerania , both in the former communist east of germany .

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .
" we believe we in northern ireland have a contribution to make .
we believe there is room for innovation and growth in northern ireland and we are very grateful for the continued support we get from the commission . "
eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .
however , northern ireland no longer has objective one status - the term given to regions of the eu which qualify for the most support from brussels .
barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .

barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .
" we believe we in northern ireland have a contribution to make .
we believe there is room for innovation and growth in northern ireland and we are very grateful for the continued support we get from the commission . "
eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .
however , northern ireland no longer has objective one status - the term given to regions of the eu which qualify for the most support from brussels .
barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable .

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .
" we believe we in northern ireland have a contribution to make .
we believe there is room for innovation and growth in northern ireland and we are very grateful for the continued support we get from the commission . "
eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .
however , northern ireland no longer has objective one status - the term given to regions of the eu which qualify for the most support from brussels .
barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not yet have guaranteed agreements from the -lrb- sudanese -rrb- government on basic technical issues , " guehenno told the council .
" the mission itself will not have the personnel or assets in place to implement its mandate for many months , even in the best-case scenario . " " grim consequences " guehenno , a former french ambassador and career diplomat , said there had been " a grave deterioration of the security situation " in darfur since his last briefing to the security council a month ago and warned of " grim consequences " for sudan if conditions did n't improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 200,000 people have died because of violence in darfur he also told reporters that darfur poses " the greatest risk for the united nations " in a decade . guehenno said the un was currently negotiating with russia and ukraine to provide troops even as he pointed out that western nations had failed to deliver promised troops , helicopters and military equipment . the peacekeeping mission is also far behind schedule because of sudanese resistance to the international force , with khartoum insisting it must be predominantly african . this week , sudanese soldiers fired on a un convoy carrying russian personnel to western darfur .
the sudanese driver of the vehicle was injured in the shooting . sweden , norway drop obligations in a further setback to the wobbly mission , sweden and norway said on wednesday they had dropped plans to send about 400 troops because of sudan 's objections . the troops were supposed to held build infrastructure in darfur where more than 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been driven from their homes since ethnic african groups took up arms in 2003 over accusations that the arab-dominated sudanese government discriminated against them . the foreign ministers of the two scandinavian nations said in a joint statement that sudan must bear " full responsibility " for their decision . " sudan hinders norway and sweden from participating in this very necessary operation , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al-bashir , in black , is against western involvement in darfur sudanese president omar al-bashir had said in november that he would not allow some european nations to take part in the force .
he singled out scandinavian countries , where the media had reproduced caricatures of prophet muhammad . " anyone who spoke blasphemously about the prophet will not set a foot on sudanese soil , " he said . " we 're waiting for you " the failure of western nations to live up to their promises has led to frustration in darfur which has seen widespread violence among rebel groups , arab militias allied with the government in khartoum and government troops . last week , german daily süddeutsche zeitung quoted a darfur human rights lawyer , salih mahmoud osman , urging western countries including germany to move faster to shore up the peacekeeping force . in july last year , the un security council set up a yearly budget of $ 1.28 billion for unamid after russia and china dropped their objections to the force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese lawyer salih mahmoud osman wants western nations to do more to help darfur " we are frustrated .
we 're waiting for you , " osman , who recently received the european parliament 's annual sakharov prize for freedom of thought told the paper .
" the people urgently need protection .
the atrocities are unimaginable . " most of the unamid troops are currently from south africa , rwanda , nigeria , kenya , gambia , senegal , bangladesh and china . last week , un secretary general ban ki moon strongly criticized western countries for failing to provide badly-needed helicopters and technical equipment . " there 's a threatening gap here , " ban ki moon said . kerstin müller , foreign affairs spokeswoman for germany 's opposition green party urged berlin to act upon its promises to darfur .

in the letter , merkel is praised by the organizations for setting up the integration summit to promote dialogue with migrant groups .
but they go on to find fault with her staunch support for koch .
" in place of the open , constructive talks and objective solutions needed , they are causing considerable damage with their election rhetoric , " the letter states .
the victim protection group weisser ring , however , criticized the immigrant groups for downplaying the seriousness and extent of the attacks . " the current problems are the tip of the iceberg , " hans-dieter schwind , the organization 's head , told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
" if they are not deal with preventively as well as repressively , they will bother us for decades . "
the hesse premier used a much publicized attack by two greek and turkish youths on a german pensioner at a munich subway train last month to call for tougher punishment for young delinquents and deportation of non- german offenders .
coalition partners at loggerheads over the tactics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant groups say populist political tactics will harm integration efforts the cdu leadership backed the state premier 's call , while its social democratic coalition partner accused it of " populism " and said existing laws were sufficient to deal with the issue .
the groups rejected deportation as a tool to deal with the crime problem .
they said it was not right hat " responsibility for the problems that have been created in our country should be offloaded on to the country where the parents or the grandparents came from . "
they also said high crime levels among young migrants were a result of their social rather than their ethnic background , and demanded equal access to education and professional training .
kenan kolat , the head of the turkish community in germany , has called on voters of turkish origin not to vote for the premier .
he accused koch of " fanning racist resentment in society . "
" we must not pave the way for political arsonists , " he said .
cdu in hesse partly responsible for problem ?

9 , that his state was the slowest when it came to dealing with youth crime cases .
this has led to further criticism that cuts made by koch 's government were partly to blame for the problem . apart from backing from merkel and other conservative party members , the premier has found support for his campagin from the far-right national democratic party .
party president udo voigt said the npd would benefit from koch 's stance .
" when established politicians adopt the npd 's arguments , it will lead to more citizens placing their trust in the policies of the npd and as a result vote for the npd , " voigt said in berlin on tuesday , dec .
8 .
the president of germany 's national council of jews , charlotte knobloch , has warned that highlighting the ethnicity of suspected criminals might play into the hands of neo-nazi campaigners .
she said crimes committed by youths with an immigrant background were " a welcome argument " for npd functionaries to call into question the right of foreigners to live in germany .
the npd is represented in the state parliaments of saxony and mecklenburg-western pomerania , both in the former communist east of germany .
it won 1.6 per cent of the vote in the last national elections in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" quality is more important than speed , " topolanek said after the news conference .
but he added that the ideal scenario would be to submit the treaties to parliament after the nato summit in bucharest in april .
tusk said poland was not trying to stall the talks until after the us presidential election .
" we are neither trying to speed up , or slow down the talks , " he said .
but the polish pm reiterated that his country was not willing to strike a deal until it receives guarantees from the us that it would boost poland 's defenses .
new polish government more wary of missile plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish prime minister donald tusk is proving a harder bargaining partner his new center-right government has taken a tougher line towards washington in the negotiations than the administration under conservative pm jaroslaw kaczynski .
after taking power in november , tusk expressed disappointment that the us side had been unable to overcome russian opposition to the missile shield plan .
warsaw decided to talk directly to moscow about the us administration 's proposals to deploy 10 missiles in poland and a radar station in the czech republic .
and high-level talks have been taking place today in warsaw between polish and russian government officials .
moscow said russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak wanted to make poland aware in his talks with chief missile defense negotiator witold waszczykowski and top diplomat radek sikorski of the " risks of the proposed system " and " help it to recognize the problems for its own strategic security . "

" northern ireland is a success story that can be an inspiration for other parts of europe - we still have problems in our continent - and for other parts of the world , " barroso said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said parts of europe suffering from conflict can learn from northern ireland he added that the eu was ready to work with northern ireland and use its leaders ' expertise and experience to bring a " sense of hope of a better future " to areas strained by conflicts and divisions .
while barroso did not explicitly mention kosovo , the future status of the predominantly ethnic-albanian province continues to be of major concern for eu officials .
" historic " visit paisley and mcguinness are both members of the power-sharing northern ireland executive which brings both the protestant and catholic communities together while remaining part of britain .
the two , who were in brussels together for the first time in their new roles , hailed a new " historic " relationship with europe .
" we have the doors to europe wide open , " said first minister paisley .
for 25 years as a member of the european parliament he had tried " to kick down the doors " he said .
however , he said now things were different and northern ireland had a " voice in high places . "
their talks with eu officials were aimed at building upon a successful peace process and cementing relationships with the eu to underpin the northern ireland economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paisley , left , and mcguinness " we are in europe , we want to be part of the european experience , " paisley told a press conference in brussels .
" we believe we in northern ireland have a contribution to make .
we believe there is room for innovation and growth in northern ireland and we are very grateful for the continued support we get from the commission . "
eu aid for northern ireland northern ireland has received about 2.5 billion euros in regional support from europe over the past 20 years .
barroso last year set up a special european commission task force on northern ireland which is due to report for the first time next month on how best to utilize eu expertise ad resources .
however , northern ireland no longer has objective one status - the term given to regions of the eu which qualify for the most support from brussels .
barroso said the north already had a strong sense of hope following the peace process and the setting up of the executive .
" we now need to turn that into opportunities and help northern ireland use available european funding as quickly as possible , " he told them .
the eu chief said up to now the bulk of eu funding had gone towards peace projects , but now the aim was to look at growth , innovation , research and training to build up the northern irish economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this clearly indicates the elections were successful and the next president of georgia is mikhail saakashvili , " campaign manager davit bakradze told afp .
" we call on all our opponents to accept the results of this election . " however , in a survey published by a ukrainian pollster after polling stations closed , saakashvili only got some 24.4 percent of votes , well behind opposition candidate levan gachechiladze with 31 percent , interfax news agency reported . preliminary results are expected by sunday . problematic campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands have protested saakashvili 's government since november saturday 's elections in the former soviet republic were marred by accusations of vote rigging made against the government .
gachechiladze told reporters on friday that a series of violations - including media coercion and misappropriation of public funds - plagued the campaign leading to the election , adding that he was considering not recognizing the presidential poll 's results . " if these kinds of things continue , and i am a hundred percent sure that this is continuing , then we ca n't recognize " the election , he said , adding that he would " continue protests and everything under the constitution " to oppose incumbent president mikhail saakashvili . " we can not give saakashvili our country and our population , because we are 100 percent sure that if he proceeds with falsified elections , we will get an authoritarian regime here very soon , " gachechiladze said after meeting with european election observers . election observers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a december report that they had received information indicating some claims of unequal campaign conditions , intimidation and vote buying . objectivity in 2nd round of voting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gachechiladze , left , is saakashvili 's main opponent last weekend , some 30,000 protesters took to the streets to demonstrate their anger over what they called an unfair five-week campaign .

a second round face-off would likely pit saakashvili against a single candidate from the fragmented opposition . denying allegations of fixing the election , saakashvili said he was confident he would receive the majority of votes on saturday , but added that he " would also accept any other result . " pair of pro-west candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a harsh crackdown on demonstrators injured georiga 's international reputation both saakashvili and gachechiladze are seen as pro-western politicians who want to move the former soviet republic away from moscow , with which tbilisi has seen relations fall to all-time lows , and toward membership in the european union and the north atlantic treaty organization . " whoever becomes president is going to pursue a euro-atlantic path , because there 's no other path to follow , " amanda akcakoca , an analyst at the european policy center in brussels , told bloomberg news last month . in addition to the presidential election , two non-binding referendums will be held to consult with voters on potential nato membership and the date for the next parliamentary elections . saakashvili 's government pushed economic reforms and sold state assets to increase foreign business in georgia .
in 2007 , according to government estimates , georgia will receive $ 1.5 billion -lrb- 1 billion euros -rrb- in foreign direct investments compared with $ 1 billion in 2006 .
but in november , the international monetary fund said unrest in the country had damaged investors ' confidence . polls commissioned by the seven candidates in saturday 's contest do not present a unified view of expected results , though most analysts believe saakashvili heads the field . not so rosy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's reputation as a democracy is at stake in this election the election is the result of a snap poll called by saakashvili after clashes in november between police and as many as 70,000 protesters .
saakashvili imposed a 15-day state of emergency to put a stop to the violence and closed down the main opposition television station , imedi . he later agreed to the early elections as part of concessions to the opposition , which accuse him of ruling in an autocratic style . but the unrest and emergency rule tarnished his reputation as one of the most democratic and reformist leaders in the former soviet union .
saakashvili came to power in 2003 after the peaceful , pro-western rose revolution . shortly after becoming president , saakashvili engineered a peaceful uprising that overthrew the region 's authoritarian ruler , aslan abashidze , who fled to russia in the face of street protests .

environment minister peter garrett said that action was critical , because plastic bags were harming australia 's land and wildlife .
he said he would meet state leaders to discuss the plan in april , with a view to implementing it by the end of 2008 .
on tuesday , china said a ban on free plastic bags would start in june .
it also banned production of extra-flimsy plastic bags , attributing both decisions to the need to reduce pollution and save resources .
' absolutely critical ' mr garrett said he thought most australians would back a move to end the distribution of free plastic bags in supermarkets and shops .
" there are some 4 billion of these plastic bags floating around the place , getting into landfills , ending up affecting our wildlife , and showing up on our beaches while we are on holidays , " he said .
" we think it 's absolutely critical that we get cracking on it . "
mr garrett did not specify whether he favoured an outright ban or whether shoppers would be charged for plastic bags .
several countries have or are considering taking action to reduce the use of plastic bags .
on wednesday , the us city of new york passed a bill requiring large shops to provide recycling bins for plastic bags .
other us cities , such as san francisco , have already banned plastic bags from grocery shops .
in ireland , meanwhile , under a law passed in 2002 , shoppers are charged for every plastic bag they use .

astronomers believe the stars once had orbiting companions , but that these were engulfed when the stars expanded .
this caused matter to be ejected from the stars , forming a disc of dust and gas from which planets could form anew .
details were presented at the 211th american astronomical society meeting in austin , texas .
jets of gas the two stars described in the latest study - known as bp piscium and tycho 4144 329 2 respectively - possess many signatures characteristic of stellar youngsters .
these include the active , rapid accretion of gas , an extended orbiting disc of dust and gas , excess emission in the infrared spectrum and - in the case of bp piscium - jets of gas being fired off into space .
it shows that planet formation is ubiquitous .
it gives us the hope to find lots of planets and hopefully some with life someday sara seager , mit after star formation , the dust and gas left over gradually forms planetesimals , like comets and asteroids , as well as planets .
so astronomers should see dusty discs around very young stars .
" if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck , we should expect that it is a duck , " explained co-author carl melis , a graduate student at the university of california , los angeles .
" but as we got more data on these stars , a lot of things just did n't add up . "
young stars should have large amounts of the metal lithium , because stars burn this element as they get older .
however , the amount of lithium in bp piscium was seven times lower than one would expect for a star of its temperature .
the researchers compared bp piscium with statistical models for stars of different ages .
' second youth ' they found it was a bad fit for a young star , but the data were in perfect agreement with the scenario for an old star .
in addition , there was no molecular cloud nearby that could have given rise to the star if it was truly young .
tycho 4144 329 2 has a companion , allowing astronomers to ascertain a distance for the star and that the age of the system was at least 400 million years old , and probably much older .
but the question of why the old stars should be undergoing a " second youth " is harder to explain .
" the only reasonable conclusion we can come to as far as the origin of the dust and gas around these stars goes is that they used to have a very short orbital period companion nearby , and that as the stars expanded ... this companion was engulfed , that caused the stars to eject matter , " said mr melis .
" but we do n't have any evidence for any planets forming in these systems as yet . "
sara seager , a professor of astronomy at massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , said the work was " really interesting " .

astronomers believe the stars once had orbiting companions , but that these were engulfed when the stars expanded .
this caused matter to be ejected from the stars , forming a disc of dust and gas from which planets could form anew .
details were presented at the 211th american astronomical society meeting in austin , texas .
jets of gas the two stars described in the latest study - known as bp piscium and tycho 4144 329 2 respectively - possess many signatures characteristic of stellar youngsters .
these include the active , rapid accretion of gas , an extended orbiting disc of dust and gas , excess emission in the infrared spectrum and - in the case of bp piscium - jets of gas being fired off into space .
it shows that planet formation is ubiquitous .
it gives us the hope to find lots of planets and hopefully some with life someday sara seager , mit after star formation , the dust and gas left over gradually forms planetesimals , like comets and asteroids , as well as planets .
so astronomers should see dusty discs around very young stars .
" if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck , we should expect that it is a duck , " explained co-author carl melis , a graduate student at the university of california , los angeles .
" but as we got more data on these stars , a lot of things just did n't add up . "
young stars should have large amounts of the metal lithium , because stars burn this element as they get older .
however , the amount of lithium in bp piscium was seven times lower than one would expect for a star of its temperature .
the researchers compared bp piscium with statistical models for stars of different ages .
' second youth ' they found it was a bad fit for a young star , but the data were in perfect agreement with the scenario for an old star .
in addition , there was no molecular cloud nearby that could have given rise to the star if it was truly young .
tycho 4144 329 2 has a companion , allowing astronomers to ascertain a distance for the star and that the age of the system was at least 400 million years old , and probably much older .

yet lyle 's golden syrup actually began life as a by-product from refining sugar cane .
however , abram lyle soon realised that the treacly substance could be turned into a delicious preserve and sweetener for cooking - and now the syrup , which was canned for the first time at plaistow wharf in london 's docklands , is celebrating its 125th anniversary .
despite being more than a century old , not much has changed over the years , including the contents , the packaging and branding of lyle 's golden syrup .
however , over the next 12 months , it will undergo its first change , in celebration of its 125 years .
workers canning lyle 's golden syrup at plaistow wharf the iconic victorian-style tins , which were established the same year as the first electric railway and has survived two world wars , are getting a makeover .
for the entire year of the anniversary , alongside its usual green tins , lyle 's golden syrup will also be available in gold tins .
the brand already made history in 2006 when it was recognised by guinness world records as having the world 's oldest branding and packaging .
the syrup 's trademark , " out of the strong came forth sweetness " and image of a dead lion and bees , is taken from the bible , influenced by abram lyle 's strong religious beliefs .
in the old testament , samson killed an attacking lion , and later noticed a swarm of bees had formed honey in the carcass .
he later turned this into a riddle : " out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness " .
it 's in our interest to support the local community factory manager ian clark the syrup started when abram lyle , a scottish businessman , sent his five sons from greenock to london to build a sugar refinery .
the refinery at plaistow wharf ceased trading in sugar in 1967 but continued producing the syrup .
in 1921 , mr lyle merged his company abram lyle & sons with henry tate & sons to become tate & lyle , which is now the only cane sugar refiner in the uk .
more than a century later the plaistow wharf factory remains the sole producer of the product under tate & lyle , producing about one million tins of syrup a month .
although founded in the uk , tate & lyle 's roots can be traced back to several companies established in the middle of the 19th century focused on sugars in europe and corn milling in the us and europe .
about 42 of tate & lyle 's 1,000 employees are based at the plaistow factory .
the remainder are based at the company 's nearby thames refinery .
factory site manager , ian clark , who collects lyle 's golden syrup brand memorabilia , says : " the factory has a long , long history and tate & lyle has always been seen to be an excellent employer .
" the fact that we 've had generations of families work here at the factory for years and years is proof of this . "
tate & lyle , now a global company , has a long history of supporting the communities in which it operates in europe , the americas , and south east asia , which all began with the philanthropic approach of its co-founders .
lyle 's golden syrup lyle 's golden syrup is older than the first petrol motorcar -lrb- 1885 -rrb- , coca-cola -lrb- 1886 -rrb- , marmite -lrb- 1902 -rrb- , and cadbury 's dairy milk -lrb- 1905 -rrb- .
gymnasts sometimes use the syrup instead of talc for better grip make-up artists have been known to use the syrup mixed with red food dye to create fake blood for films the company 's charitable spend allocations are the areas of education , the environment , health and the arts .
last year more than 3,000 primary school children visited the thames refinery for its annual child safety awareness programme run by the metropolitan police .
each year the two london factories also take in 40 work experience students between them and also work closely with school children on the national curriculum .
mr clark said : " it 's in our interest to support the local community .
if we help to raise the academic level of the people in the area then in turn the company will benefit from this . "
and how does this century-old factory keep up with modern times ?
" in the factory , we have new equipment , alongside old , to meet the requirements of the day , " explained mr clark .
" all new equipment is designed and built with flexibility in mind .
we have to think about what we may need it for as there are always lots of changes taking place . "

yet lyle 's golden syrup actually began life as a by-product from refining sugar cane .
however , abram lyle soon realised that the treacly substance could be turned into a delicious preserve and sweetener for cooking - and now the syrup , which was canned for the first time at plaistow wharf in london 's docklands , is celebrating its 125th anniversary .
despite being more than a century old , not much has changed over the years , including the contents , the packaging and branding of lyle 's golden syrup .
however , over the next 12 months , it will undergo its first change , in celebration of its 125 years .
workers canning lyle 's golden syrup at plaistow wharf the iconic victorian-style tins , which were established the same year as the first electric railway and has survived two world wars , are getting a makeover .
for the entire year of the anniversary , alongside its usual green tins , lyle 's golden syrup will also be available in gold tins .
the brand already made history in 2006 when it was recognised by guinness world records as having the world 's oldest branding and packaging .
the syrup 's trademark , " out of the strong came forth sweetness " and image of a dead lion and bees , is taken from the bible , influenced by abram lyle 's strong religious beliefs .
in the old testament , samson killed an attacking lion , and later noticed a swarm of bees had formed honey in the carcass .
he later turned this into a riddle : " out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness " .
it 's in our interest to support the local community factory manager ian clark the syrup started when abram lyle , a scottish businessman , sent his five sons from greenock to london to build a sugar refinery .
the refinery at plaistow wharf ceased trading in sugar in 1967 but continued producing the syrup .
in 1921 , mr lyle merged his company abram lyle & sons with henry tate & sons to become tate & lyle , which is now the only cane sugar refiner in the uk .
more than a century later the plaistow wharf factory remains the sole producer of the product under tate & lyle , producing about one million tins of syrup a month .
although founded in the uk , tate & lyle 's roots can be traced back to several companies established in the middle of the 19th century focused on sugars in europe and corn milling in the us and europe .
about 42 of tate & lyle 's 1,000 employees are based at the plaistow factory .
the remainder are based at the company 's nearby thames refinery .
factory site manager , ian clark , who collects lyle 's golden syrup brand memorabilia , says : " the factory has a long , long history and tate & lyle has always been seen to be an excellent employer .
" the fact that we 've had generations of families work here at the factory for years and years is proof of this . "
tate & lyle , now a global company , has a long history of supporting the communities in which it operates in europe , the americas , and south east asia , which all began with the philanthropic approach of its co-founders .
lyle 's golden syrup lyle 's golden syrup is older than the first petrol motorcar -lrb- 1885 -rrb- , coca-cola -lrb- 1886 -rrb- , marmite -lrb- 1902 -rrb- , and cadbury 's dairy milk -lrb- 1905 -rrb- .
gymnasts sometimes use the syrup instead of talc for better grip make-up artists have been known to use the syrup mixed with red food dye to create fake blood for films the company 's charitable spend allocations are the areas of education , the environment , health and the arts .
last year more than 3,000 primary school children visited the thames refinery for its annual child safety awareness programme run by the metropolitan police .
each year the two london factories also take in 40 work experience students between them and also work closely with school children on the national curriculum .
mr clark said : " it 's in our interest to support the local community .
if we help to raise the academic level of the people in the area then in turn the company will benefit from this . "
and how does this century-old factory keep up with modern times ?
" in the factory , we have new equipment , alongside old , to meet the requirements of the day , " explained mr clark .
" all new equipment is designed and built with flexibility in mind .
we have to think about what we may need it for as there are always lots of changes taking place . "

yet lyle 's golden syrup actually began life as a by-product from refining sugar cane .
however , abram lyle soon realised that the treacly substance could be turned into a delicious preserve and sweetener for cooking - and now the syrup , which was canned for the first time at plaistow wharf in london 's docklands , is celebrating its 125th anniversary .
despite being more than a century old , not much has changed over the years , including the contents , the packaging and branding of lyle 's golden syrup .
however , over the next 12 months , it will undergo its first change , in celebration of its 125 years .
workers canning lyle 's golden syrup at plaistow wharf the iconic victorian-style tins , which were established the same year as the first electric railway and has survived two world wars , are getting a makeover .
for the entire year of the anniversary , alongside its usual green tins , lyle 's golden syrup will also be available in gold tins .
the brand already made history in 2006 when it was recognised by guinness world records as having the world 's oldest branding and packaging .
the syrup 's trademark , " out of the strong came forth sweetness " and image of a dead lion and bees , is taken from the bible , influenced by abram lyle 's strong religious beliefs .
in the old testament , samson killed an attacking lion , and later noticed a swarm of bees had formed honey in the carcass .
he later turned this into a riddle : " out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness " .
it 's in our interest to support the local community factory manager ian clark the syrup started when abram lyle , a scottish businessman , sent his five sons from greenock to london to build a sugar refinery .
the refinery at plaistow wharf ceased trading in sugar in 1967 but continued producing the syrup .
in 1921 , mr lyle merged his company abram lyle & sons with henry tate & sons to become tate & lyle , which is now the only cane sugar refiner in the uk .
more than a century later the plaistow wharf factory remains the sole producer of the product under tate & lyle , producing about one million tins of syrup a month .
although founded in the uk , tate & lyle 's roots can be traced back to several companies established in the middle of the 19th century focused on sugars in europe and corn milling in the us and europe .
about 42 of tate & lyle 's 1,000 employees are based at the plaistow factory .
the remainder are based at the company 's nearby thames refinery .
factory site manager , ian clark , who collects lyle 's golden syrup brand memorabilia , says : " the factory has a long , long history and tate & lyle has always been seen to be an excellent employer .
" the fact that we 've had generations of families work here at the factory for years and years is proof of this . "
tate & lyle , now a global company , has a long history of supporting the communities in which it operates in europe , the americas , and south east asia , which all began with the philanthropic approach of its co-founders .
lyle 's golden syrup lyle 's golden syrup is older than the first petrol motorcar -lrb- 1885 -rrb- , coca-cola -lrb- 1886 -rrb- , marmite -lrb- 1902 -rrb- , and cadbury 's dairy milk -lrb- 1905 -rrb- .
gymnasts sometimes use the syrup instead of talc for better grip make-up artists have been known to use the syrup mixed with red food dye to create fake blood for films the company 's charitable spend allocations are the areas of education , the environment , health and the arts .
last year more than 3,000 primary school children visited the thames refinery for its annual child safety awareness programme run by the metropolitan police .
each year the two london factories also take in 40 work experience students between them and also work closely with school children on the national curriculum .
mr clark said : " it 's in our interest to support the local community .
if we help to raise the academic level of the people in the area then in turn the company will benefit from this . "
and how does this century-old factory keep up with modern times ?
" in the factory , we have new equipment , alongside old , to meet the requirements of the day , " explained mr clark .
" all new equipment is designed and built with flexibility in mind .
we have to think about what we may need it for as there are always lots of changes taking place . "

the births of the male cubs are extremely important as barbary lions are extinct in the wild and zoos are the only hope for their survival .
there are about 40 barbary lions cared for by various zoos in europe and fewer than 100 in zoos around the world .
the cubs ' parents , qays and fidda , arrived at belfast zoo in july 2005 and the pair are the second litter to be born to the pride .
the zoo became even more popular last june following the birth of lily the lion cub .
measuring just 37cm long , she was rejected by her mother and had to be hand-reared .
she now shares an enclosure with a dog to encourage her to abandon her bond with humans .
it is hoped she can join the lion enclosure later this year .
marketing manager joy bond said : " the zoo is absolutely delighted that we have two more barbary lion cubs .
" it 's a significant achievement for belfast zoo and its keepers that the lion pride unit continues to grow , and that the mother and baby relationship has developed .
" the sub-species of lion are conservationally important as they are extinct in the wild . "
the species was certified extinct after the last known barbary was shot in morocco in 1921 .

during the next few weeks they will carry out the painstaking job of counting each and every animal that lives in their collection - from gorilla to gecko , frog to flamingo , shark to spider .
british and irish association of zoos and aquariums -lrb- biaza -rrb- director miranda stevenson says : " once a year , zoos around the country need to check that the number of animals that they have on their computers is the same as the number of animals in their collection . "
creature accountancy in pictures this annual " stock-take " falls under the zoo licensing act , legislation that governs all zoos and aquariums .
but of course , dr stevenson adds , some animals are more tricky to tot up than others .
dr david gibson is director of husbandry at the deep , an aquarium in hull .
he thinks counting schools of identical fish poses the ultimate challenge .
" some of the animals we have in the aquarium are really simple to count - a 3.5m-long -lsb- 12ft -rsb- shark , for example .
but the problem comes when you have the schooling species that look identical , " he says .
the job requires a keen eye and a lot of patience .
i would be fibbing if i said it was n't hard work for some species warren spencer , bristol zoo dr gibson says : " a member of staff will be assigned to a particular species , like the horse-eye jack , and they will stand at the window of the tank and use clicker counters to count the number of fish in the school that they see at any one time .
" they 'll do this six , seven or eight times until they get a consistent number . "
the technique is surprisingly accurate .
" we know we have 208 horse-eye jacks " , dr gibson says with confidence .
birds wear identification bracelets with unique numbers on warren spencer is somebody else facing some challenging counting .
he is the curator of invertebrates at bristol zoo gardens , looking after the 67 different species that live in bug world .
mr spencer says : " we love these animals and these censuses are very very important , but i would be fibbing if i said it was n't hard work for some species , because it is . "
luckily groups of insects such as ants or locusts are counted as a single colony rather than requiring the laborious task of being checked off as individuals .
" but for others like stick insects and beetles we do have to count them one by one , " mr spencer adds .
the number-crunching is complicated further still by having to determine the tally of the insects at their various life-stages , separating them into adults , larvae and eggs .
but , says mr spencer , although audits are tough work they are vital .
he explains : " we need to have very specific records of all of our animals .
all hands are going to be on deck david field , zsl london zoo " and although we do this annual census , there are lots of audits taking place throughout the year - for us the job of counting our invertebrates is ongoing and continuous . "
david field , zoological director at zsl london zoo and whipsnade , adds that keeping stock of the animals is key for conservation .
he says many zoos ' inventories will be submitted to an international database called the international species information system -lrb- isis -rrb- , which gathers information about animals held in zoological institutions around the world .
he said : " it is a real priority to make sure our figures are correct so we can best manage conservation .
animal numbers are submitted to an international database " some of the species we keep here , like socorro doves , are now extinct in the wild , so the only populations exist in zoos .
" so when zoos submit data to these central databases , it means that we can run detailed and scientifically based breeding programmes . "
mr field admits that the next few days are going to be busy for those working in zoos around the country .
" all hands are going to be on deck , " he says .
" it is going to be a challenging job , but once we have done stock-take and produced the whole inventory for the year , we are going to be able to sit back and see what we have been able to breed and to see what we have been able to achieve during the year . "

during the next few weeks they will carry out the painstaking job of counting each and every animal that lives in their collection - from gorilla to gecko , frog to flamingo , shark to spider .
british and irish association of zoos and aquariums -lrb- biaza -rrb- director miranda stevenson says : " once a year , zoos around the country need to check that the number of animals that they have on their computers is the same as the number of animals in their collection . "
creature accountancy in pictures this annual " stock-take " falls under the zoo licensing act , legislation that governs all zoos and aquariums .
but of course , dr stevenson adds , some animals are more tricky to tot up than others .
dr david gibson is director of husbandry at the deep , an aquarium in hull .
he thinks counting schools of identical fish poses the ultimate challenge .
" some of the animals we have in the aquarium are really simple to count - a 3.5m-long -lsb- 12ft -rsb- shark , for example .
but the problem comes when you have the schooling species that look identical , " he says .
the job requires a keen eye and a lot of patience .
i would be fibbing if i said it was n't hard work for some species warren spencer , bristol zoo dr gibson says : " a member of staff will be assigned to a particular species , like the horse-eye jack , and they will stand at the window of the tank and use clicker counters to count the number of fish in the school that they see at any one time .
" they 'll do this six , seven or eight times until they get a consistent number . "
the technique is surprisingly accurate .
" we know we have 208 horse-eye jacks " , dr gibson says with confidence .

he is the curator of invertebrates at bristol zoo gardens , looking after the 67 different species that live in bug world .
mr spencer says : " we love these animals and these censuses are very very important , but i would be fibbing if i said it was n't hard work for some species , because it is . "
luckily groups of insects such as ants or locusts are counted as a single colony rather than requiring the laborious task of being checked off as individuals .
" but for others like stick insects and beetles we do have to count them one by one , " mr spencer adds .
the number-crunching is complicated further still by having to determine the tally of the insects at their various life-stages , separating them into adults , larvae and eggs .
but , says mr spencer , although audits are tough work they are vital .
he explains : " we need to have very specific records of all of our animals .
all hands are going to be on deck david field , zsl london zoo " and although we do this annual census , there are lots of audits taking place throughout the year - for us the job of counting our invertebrates is ongoing and continuous . "
david field , zoological director at zsl london zoo and whipsnade , adds that keeping stock of the animals is key for conservation .
he says many zoos ' inventories will be submitted to an international database called the international species information system -lrb- isis -rrb- , which gathers information about animals held in zoological institutions around the world .
he said : " it is a real priority to make sure our figures are correct so we can best manage conservation .
animal numbers are submitted to an international database " some of the species we keep here , like socorro doves , are now extinct in the wild , so the only populations exist in zoos .
" so when zoos submit data to these central databases , it means that we can run detailed and scientifically based breeding programmes . "
mr field admits that the next few days are going to be busy for those working in zoos around the country .
" all hands are going to be on deck , " he says .
" it is going to be a challenging job , but once we have done stock-take and produced the whole inventory for the year , we are going to be able to sit back and see what we have been able to breed and to see what we have been able to achieve during the year . "

the court dismissed a petition from mr lee 's backers , which sought to halt the inquiry on the grounds that legislation authorising it was unconstitutional .
a special prosecutor will start working on the case next week .
mr lee won a landslide victory in last month 's presidential election and is due to take office on 25 february .
analysts believe the investigation is unlikely to be completed by then , and once mr lee takes office he will be immune from prosecution .
video evidence the 65-year-old former executive was dogged throughout his election campaign by allegations linking him to a financial scandal in 2001 .
the case involved his alleged links to an investment firm at the centre of a share-rigging scandal .
in early december , prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to charge mr lee .
but lawmakers then voted to re-open the case when a video emerged in which the president-elect was shown apparently saying he had established the scandal-hit company .
he denies the allegations and says his words have been taken out of context .
mr lee 's supporters claimed that clauses in the law authorising a fresh investigation were unconstitutional .
but the court ruled that while one part of the law - enabling investigators to question witnesses without a warrant - violated the constitution , the probe could go ahead .

the court dismissed a petition from mr lee 's backers , which sought to halt the inquiry on the grounds that legislation authorising it was unconstitutional .
a special prosecutor will start working on the case next week .
mr lee won a landslide victory in last month 's presidential election and is due to take office on 25 february .
analysts believe the investigation is unlikely to be completed by then , and once mr lee takes office he will be immune from prosecution .
video evidence the 65-year-old former executive was dogged throughout his election campaign by allegations linking him to a financial scandal in 2001 .
the case involved his alleged links to an investment firm at the centre of a share-rigging scandal .
in early december , prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to charge mr lee .
but lawmakers then voted to re-open the case when a video emerged in which the president-elect was shown apparently saying he had established the scandal-hit company .
he denies the allegations and says his words have been taken out of context .
mr lee 's supporters claimed that clauses in the law authorising a fresh investigation were unconstitutional .
but the court ruled that while one part of the law - enabling investigators to question witnesses without a warrant - violated the constitution , the probe could go ahead .

the album sold 122,000 copies during its first week , displacing soul singer mary j blige from the number one spot .
it is the band 's second us chart topper following 2000 's kid a , which sold an initial 207,000 copies .

the sales tally also falls well short of radiohead 's 2003 album hail to the thief , which made its debut in the us album chart at number three with first week sales of 300,000 - a career best for the band .
it eventually went on to sell more than one million copies .
in october , the band took the decision to make in rainbows available through their website , allowing fans to pay what they thought it was worth , even if it was nothing .
on sunday , the physical release topped the uk album chart .
speaking earlier this month , radiohead frontman thom yorke said that releasing the album solely on the internet would have been " mad " , and that it was important for the band to make a physical release available .
the band has declined to comment on how many times in rainbows was downloaded or how much money they made from the experiment .

the album sold 122,000 copies during its first week , displacing soul singer mary j blige from the number one spot .
it is the band 's second us chart topper following 2000 's kid a , which sold an initial 207,000 copies .
analysts say the relatively modest sales of in rainbows were due to its earlier high profile digital release .
falls short it has also come out at a traditionally quiet time for the music charts , while some 10,000 copies were sold early after some retailers put it on their shelves ahead of its official 1 january release date .
the sales tally also falls well short of radiohead 's 2003 album hail to the thief , which made its debut in the us album chart at number three with first week sales of 300,000 - a career best for the band .
it eventually went on to sell more than one million copies .
in october , the band took the decision to make in rainbows available through their website , allowing fans to pay what they thought it was worth , even if it was nothing .
on sunday , the physical release topped the uk album chart .
speaking earlier this month , radiohead frontman thom yorke said that releasing the album solely on the internet would have been " mad " , and that it was important for the band to make a physical release available .
the band has declined to comment on how many times in rainbows was downloaded or how much money they made from the experiment .

the study by a leeds university professor was commissioned by the rspb , which is opposing the expansion of london ashford airport -lrb- laa -rrb- in lydd .
professor chris feare was asked to look at bird-hazard control at the airport .
but laa chief zaher deir said it had been proven birds and aviation could co-exist in the same surroundings .
plan ' non-starter ' professor feare 's report said the proposals for an extended runway and new passenger terminal could pose an " extremely hazardous " bird-strike threat .
and he said pilots may need to exercise considerable flexibility to avoid putting their flights in danger .
he recommended measures to be taken at the airport to minimise risk , such as netting ponds and lakes , and preventing birds nesting in aircraft hangars and on roofs .
rspb chief graham wynne said the report proved expansion was " a non-starter " .
he said the 75-year-old , 1,000-acre dungeness reserve had up to 120,000 birds in the winter , and more than 60 breeding species in the summer .
concerns raised by the rspb are that larger planes could harm birds and other wildlife , with disturbance and pollution .
mr deir said : " it is not the number of passengers that matters , it is the effective management of bird-control systems around any airport that really counts . "
he said the findings of three bird surveys had been submitted to shepway council , which will consider the plans this month .
