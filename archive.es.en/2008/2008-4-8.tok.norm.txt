no one , however , talks about the online game 's risks and negative side-effects . nine years after retiring from his professional tennis career , millionaire boris becker is cashing in on aces once again .
he 's become the spokesman in a high-profile ad campaign for a poker web site . becker is n't the only celebrity to lend his face to an industry that 's trying to polish up its image and increase its social acceptability .
bayer leverkusen soccer club has also done ads for an online poker company . the virtual version of the classic card game first took off in 2003 when american player chris moneymaker bet $ 39 in an internet tournament and came away with $ 2.5 million .
since then , the trend has made its way around the world . according to the 2008 addiction yearbook , between 200,000 and 290,000 germans regularly play poker on the internet .
in 2006 , they were estimated to have spent around 1 million euros gambling online . at the edge of the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker had a poor hand last month in berlin in germany , it 's only legal to gamble for money in casinos , leaving the booming internet market in a grey area .
if it involves money , online gambling is against the law , but so far no one has been charged with the crime .
game providers ' servers are located far away in gibraltar , malta and the seychelles , making questions of jurisdiction difficult for prosecutors to answer . germany 's tax authorities have a monopoly on the gambling business and pocket more than half of the industry 's earnings as corporate tax .
online gambling , however , remains unregulated and profits circumvent state coffers . officially , boris becker advertises the non-commercial wing of a particular poker provider , where players deal only in fake money .
the aim , though , is to interest more and more people in the provider 's " real money " sites , which are reported to draw in huge profits though representatives are unwilling to disclose how much they earn . but revenues are high enough , in any case , to broadcast elaborate ads on prime-time television featuring former sports stars . surgeon turned poker pro reigning poker world champion michael keiner first caught the bug 15 years ago when the surgeon was at a conference in the us .
he was fascinated by the variety of skills needed , the psychological aspects of the game and the mind-boggling sums that changed hands . after a few years of going back and forth from the poker table to the operation table , he closed down his cosmetic-surgery practice and dedicated himself to the game .
now the 49-year-old participates in international poker tournaments 250 days a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael keiner prefers the live version keiner is sponsored by an online poker provider , but still prefers meeting his opponents face to face . " i 'm a live player , " he said . the poker pro added that the online games lack the psychological component that makes live play so intense and exciting .
they 're anonymous , engineered and just focus on probability calculations , he said . while many online gamblers run special computer programs to analyze their chances , keiner prefers to rely on his own skills and experience . internet opens door to addiction beginners , however , can get themselves into serious debt by overestimating their abilities - and mistaking luck for skill . psychologist tobias hayer from the university of bremen , who specializes in gambling addiction , said that online poker has considerably lowered the threshold for compulsion . " there 's no social monitoring anymore , " hayer said . and there 's no legal monitoring either .
online poker is still immune from criminal prosecution as lawyers continue to debate its legal definition .
the game is a mix of calculable and incalculable elements , so is it gambling or a sport ? on the web , users can play against boris becker .
but in real life the tennis pro turned spokesman has n't had much success at the poker table , despite professional coaching .
at the " boris is back " finale in berlin in early march , he was eliminated after the first round . vera moeller-holtkamp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .
unfortunately , beijing has gone in the other direction . " the united states plays a central role in it all , and yet washington has remained utterly silent about the possibility of an olympic boycott .
one reason is that the us has become inordinately dependent financially on china of late .
financial concerns are americans ' priority now , " the paper speculated . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he confirmed that officials would discuss the relay in meetings planned this week after the disruptive protests in london and paris .
" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the demonstrators accuse the chinese government of violating human rights during its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the nazi era , huge numbers of eastern europeans were forced to do factory or farm work at low pay , replacing millions of men conscripted into hitler 's army .

the church decided to expose its own guilt in greater detail , commissioning a 700-page historical study of the 4,829 laborers and 1,075 prisoners of war it had obtained from the nazi labor office .
the main historian , karl-joseph hummel , said only a limited number of catholic facilities had used forced labor , and at the same time , the nazis had been persecuting the church .

during the nazi era , huge numbers of eastern europeans were forced to do factory or farm work at low pay , replacing millions of men conscripted into hitler 's army .

the main historian , karl-joseph hummel , said only a limited number of catholic facilities had used forced labor , and at the same time , the nazis had been persecuting the church .

db 's many initiatives demonstrate just the opposite . " train to end tour at auschwitz the exhibit , which focuses on the plight of deported children , displays photos and film excerpts of survivors who describe their deportation experience .
after berlin , the train of commemoration is set to continue on to six other german cities before crossing over into poland . on may 8 , the anniversary of the end of the war in germany , the exhibit will arrive in auschwitz , one of the nazis ' most deadly concentration camps . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , the trend has made its way around the world . according to the 2008 addiction yearbook , between 200,000 and 290,000 germans regularly play poker on the internet .
in 2006 , they were estimated to have spent around 1 million euros gambling online . at the edge of the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker had a poor hand last month in berlin in germany , it 's only legal to gamble for money in casinos , leaving the booming internet market in a grey area .
if it involves money , online gambling is against the law , but so far no one has been charged with the crime .
game providers ' servers are located far away in gibraltar , malta and the seychelles , making questions of jurisdiction difficult for prosecutors to answer . germany 's tax authorities have a monopoly on the gambling business and pocket more than half of the industry 's earnings as corporate tax .
online gambling , however , remains unregulated and profits circumvent state coffers . officially , boris becker advertises the non-commercial wing of a particular poker provider , where players deal only in fake money .
the aim , though , is to interest more and more people in the provider 's " real money " sites , which are reported to draw in huge profits though representatives are unwilling to disclose how much they earn . but revenues are high enough , in any case , to broadcast elaborate ads on prime-time television featuring former sports stars . surgeon turned poker pro reigning poker world champion michael keiner first caught the bug 15 years ago when the surgeon was at a conference in the us .
he was fascinated by the variety of skills needed , the psychological aspects of the game and the mind-boggling sums that changed hands . after a few years of going back and forth from the poker table to the operation table , he closed down his cosmetic-surgery practice and dedicated himself to the game .
now the 49-year-old participates in international poker tournaments 250 days a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael keiner prefers the live version keiner is sponsored by an online poker provider , but still prefers meeting his opponents face to face . " i 'm a live player , " he said . the poker pro added that the online games lack the psychological component that makes live play so intense and exciting .
they 're anonymous , engineered and just focus on probability calculations , he said . while many online gamblers run special computer programs to analyze their chances , keiner prefers to rely on his own skills and experience . internet opens door to addiction beginners , however , can get themselves into serious debt by overestimating their abilities - and mistaking luck for skill . psychologist tobias hayer from the university of bremen , who specializes in gambling addiction , said that online poker has considerably lowered the threshold for compulsion . " there 's no social monitoring anymore , " hayer said . and there 's no legal monitoring either .
online poker is still immune from criminal prosecution as lawyers continue to debate its legal definition .
the game is a mix of calculable and incalculable elements , so is it gambling or a sport ? on the web , users can play against boris becker .
but in real life the tennis pro turned spokesman has n't had much success at the poker table , despite professional coaching .
at the " boris is back " finale in berlin in early march , he was eliminated after the first round . vera moeller-holtkamp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.04.2008 olympic torch relays perfect stage for protests , papers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security officials extinguished the torch four times amid raucous protests in paris olympics leaders are to review this week whether the torch relays ahead of the games should continue given global protests .
but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .

" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .

" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .

beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .

the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .

during the nazi era , huge numbers of eastern europeans were forced to do factory or farm work at low pay , replacing millions of men conscripted into hitler 's army .
employers that are still in existence today have contributed to compensation trusts .
the church decided to expose its own guilt in greater detail , commissioning a 700-page historical study of the 4,829 laborers and 1,075 prisoners of war it had obtained from the nazi labor office .
the main historian , karl-joseph hummel , said only a limited number of catholic facilities had used forced labor , and at the same time , the nazis had been persecuting the church .
most laborers did not work in churches , but typically in catholic hospitals and cemeteries , on farms run by monasteries or in domestic service .
according to the study , most hailed from poland , ukraine and the soviet union .
church failed to speak out in a radio interview , hummel said the church had failed by not speaking out clearly against the nazi regime .
" it should have clearly said how its interpretation of loyalty , honor and the fatherland was not the same as the nazis ' view , " he said .
the german catholic bishops ' conference said it had also spent 2.71 million euros on 200 reconciliation projects in eastern europe .
cardinal karl lehmann of mainz said the report was not aimed at achieving closure , and that more reconciliation efforts were planned .
" it 's a burden of history that our church will keep facing up to in the future , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .

but olympic officials hint the tradition might be abandoned . protests over olympic host china 's human rights record were in full swing even before the olympic torch touched down in san francisco on tuesday , april 8 .
on monday , three activists climbed the city 's famous golden gate bridge to hang huge pro-tibet banners .
san francisco 's mayor , gavin newsom , said he was anticipating security problems , and that the route for the torch relay would be subject to last minute changes if need be .
meanwhile , olympic officials in beijing hinted for the first time at the option of abandoning subsequent legs of the torch relay .
last torch relay ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president , belgian jacques rogge ioc president jacques rogge said he was saddened by the protests in london and paris around the torch relay for the beijing games but did not want to join speculation on the future of the symbolic event .
he confirmed that officials would discuss the relay in meetings planned this week after the disruptive protests in london and paris .
" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .

the main historian , karl-joseph hummel , said only a limited number of catholic facilities had used forced labor , and at the same time , the nazis had been persecuting the church .
most laborers did not work in churches , but typically in catholic hospitals and cemeteries , on farms run by monasteries or in domestic service .
according to the study , most hailed from poland , ukraine and the soviet union .
church failed to speak out in a radio interview , hummel said the church had failed by not speaking out clearly against the nazi regime .

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .

it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .

the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.04.2008 online poker lures players in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the web , you do n't have to have a poker face there 's no felt table , no free drinks and no poker face , but internet gambling is booming in germany .
no one , however , talks about the online game 's risks and negative side-effects . nine years after retiring from his professional tennis career , millionaire boris becker is cashing in on aces once again .
he 's become the spokesman in a high-profile ad campaign for a poker web site . becker is n't the only celebrity to lend his face to an industry that 's trying to polish up its image and increase its social acceptability .
bayer leverkusen soccer club has also done ads for an online poker company . the virtual version of the classic card game first took off in 2003 when american player chris moneymaker bet $ 39 in an internet tournament and came away with $ 2.5 million .
since then , the trend has made its way around the world . according to the 2008 addiction yearbook , between 200,000 and 290,000 germans regularly play poker on the internet .
in 2006 , they were estimated to have spent around 1 million euros gambling online . at the edge of the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker had a poor hand last month in berlin in germany , it 's only legal to gamble for money in casinos , leaving the booming internet market in a grey area .
if it involves money , online gambling is against the law , but so far no one has been charged with the crime .
game providers ' servers are located far away in gibraltar , malta and the seychelles , making questions of jurisdiction difficult for prosecutors to answer . germany 's tax authorities have a monopoly on the gambling business and pocket more than half of the industry 's earnings as corporate tax .
online gambling , however , remains unregulated and profits circumvent state coffers . officially , boris becker advertises the non-commercial wing of a particular poker provider , where players deal only in fake money .
the aim , though , is to interest more and more people in the provider 's " real money " sites , which are reported to draw in huge profits though representatives are unwilling to disclose how much they earn . but revenues are high enough , in any case , to broadcast elaborate ads on prime-time television featuring former sports stars . surgeon turned poker pro reigning poker world champion michael keiner first caught the bug 15 years ago when the surgeon was at a conference in the us .
he was fascinated by the variety of skills needed , the psychological aspects of the game and the mind-boggling sums that changed hands . after a few years of going back and forth from the poker table to the operation table , he closed down his cosmetic-surgery practice and dedicated himself to the game .
now the 49-year-old participates in international poker tournaments 250 days a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael keiner prefers the live version keiner is sponsored by an online poker provider , but still prefers meeting his opponents face to face . " i 'm a live player , " he said . the poker pro added that the online games lack the psychological component that makes live play so intense and exciting .
they 're anonymous , engineered and just focus on probability calculations , he said . while many online gamblers run special computer programs to analyze their chances , keiner prefers to rely on his own skills and experience . internet opens door to addiction beginners , however , can get themselves into serious debt by overestimating their abilities - and mistaking luck for skill . psychologist tobias hayer from the university of bremen , who specializes in gambling addiction , said that online poker has considerably lowered the threshold for compulsion . " there 's no social monitoring anymore , " hayer said . and there 's no legal monitoring either .
online poker is still immune from criminal prosecution as lawyers continue to debate its legal definition .
the game is a mix of calculable and incalculable elements , so is it gambling or a sport ? on the web , users can play against boris becker .
but in real life the tennis pro turned spokesman has n't had much success at the poker table , despite professional coaching .
at the " boris is back " finale in berlin in early march , he was eliminated after the first round . vera moeller-holtkamp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers insist the deportation exhibit ahould be shown in the busy hub . the train of commemoration , a mobile memorial to holocaust victims , has been passing through train stations in germany since early november .
it is set to arrive in the german capital on sunday , april 13 , for a 10-day stay at five stations .
but deutsche bahn has dubbed the central station off-limits for the privately organized exhibit , citing heavy traffic . organizers have rejected the smaller stations that deutsche bahn offered as an alternative . in a statement issued on monday , april 7 , the international auschwitz committee said it was " angered " by deutsche bahn 's decision : " both the financial conditions and the barring of important train stations for the train of commemoration are incomprehensible and unacceptable . " bahn rents tracks for high price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's central station opened in may 2006 an ongoing conflict over what the organization is to pay deutsche bahn for the use of exhibition space at stations throughout germany remains unresolved , though fees are estimated to total between 70,000 and 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 to $ 157,000 -rrb- . berlin mayor klaus wowereit urged deutsche bahn to find an appropriate place in the central station for the exhibit . " the holocaust was thought out and planned in the german capital , " said wowereit in a statement published on the train of commemoration web site .
" berlin 's jews were systematically brought by the nazis to death camps - and by train . especially in berlin , it must be possible for a commendable memorial project like the train of commemoration to receive every kind of support in our city . " protest march planned in berlin project organizers have planned protest on saturday at the brandenburg gate in central berlin , followed by a silent march to the nearby deutsche bahn headquarters . according to die welt newspaper , authorities are examining the legitimacy of the train company 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's route covers 60 stations and 6,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- the president of the international auschwitz committee , noach flug , said " deutsche bahn 's undignified stance toward such an important civic project damages germany 's reputation and serves to encourage right-wing extremism in europe .

db 's many initiatives demonstrate just the opposite . " train to end tour at auschwitz the exhibit , which focuses on the plight of deported children , displays photos and film excerpts of survivors who describe their deportation experience .
after berlin , the train of commemoration is set to continue on to six other german cities before crossing over into poland . on may 8 , the anniversary of the end of the war in germany , the exhibit will arrive in auschwitz , one of the nazis ' most deadly concentration camps . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during the nazi era , huge numbers of eastern europeans were forced to do factory or farm work at low pay , replacing millions of men conscripted into hitler 's army .
employers that are still in existence today have contributed to compensation trusts .
the church decided to expose its own guilt in greater detail , commissioning a 700-page historical study of the 4,829 laborers and 1,075 prisoners of war it had obtained from the nazi labor office .
the main historian , karl-joseph hummel , said only a limited number of catholic facilities had used forced labor , and at the same time , the nazis had been persecuting the church .
most laborers did not work in churches , but typically in catholic hospitals and cemeteries , on farms run by monasteries or in domestic service .
according to the study , most hailed from poland , ukraine and the soviet union .
church failed to speak out in a radio interview , hummel said the church had failed by not speaking out clearly against the nazi regime .
" it should have clearly said how its interpretation of loyalty , honor and the fatherland was not the same as the nazis ' view , " he said .
the german catholic bishops ' conference said it had also spent 2.71 million euros on 200 reconciliation projects in eastern europe .
cardinal karl lehmann of mainz said the report was not aimed at achieving closure , and that more reconciliation efforts were planned .
" it 's a burden of history that our church will keep facing up to in the future , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.04.2008 online poker lures players in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the web , you do n't have to have a poker face there 's no felt table , no free drinks and no poker face , but internet gambling is booming in germany .
no one , however , talks about the online game 's risks and negative side-effects . nine years after retiring from his professional tennis career , millionaire boris becker is cashing in on aces once again .
he 's become the spokesman in a high-profile ad campaign for a poker web site . becker is n't the only celebrity to lend his face to an industry that 's trying to polish up its image and increase its social acceptability .
bayer leverkusen soccer club has also done ads for an online poker company . the virtual version of the classic card game first took off in 2003 when american player chris moneymaker bet $ 39 in an internet tournament and came away with $ 2.5 million .
since then , the trend has made its way around the world . according to the 2008 addiction yearbook , between 200,000 and 290,000 germans regularly play poker on the internet .
in 2006 , they were estimated to have spent around 1 million euros gambling online . at the edge of the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker had a poor hand last month in berlin in germany , it 's only legal to gamble for money in casinos , leaving the booming internet market in a grey area .
if it involves money , online gambling is against the law , but so far no one has been charged with the crime .
game providers ' servers are located far away in gibraltar , malta and the seychelles , making questions of jurisdiction difficult for prosecutors to answer . germany 's tax authorities have a monopoly on the gambling business and pocket more than half of the industry 's earnings as corporate tax .
online gambling , however , remains unregulated and profits circumvent state coffers . officially , boris becker advertises the non-commercial wing of a particular poker provider , where players deal only in fake money .
the aim , though , is to interest more and more people in the provider 's " real money " sites , which are reported to draw in huge profits though representatives are unwilling to disclose how much they earn . but revenues are high enough , in any case , to broadcast elaborate ads on prime-time television featuring former sports stars . surgeon turned poker pro reigning poker world champion michael keiner first caught the bug 15 years ago when the surgeon was at a conference in the us .
he was fascinated by the variety of skills needed , the psychological aspects of the game and the mind-boggling sums that changed hands . after a few years of going back and forth from the poker table to the operation table , he closed down his cosmetic-surgery practice and dedicated himself to the game .
now the 49-year-old participates in international poker tournaments 250 days a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael keiner prefers the live version keiner is sponsored by an online poker provider , but still prefers meeting his opponents face to face . " i 'm a live player , " he said . the poker pro added that the online games lack the psychological component that makes live play so intense and exciting .
they 're anonymous , engineered and just focus on probability calculations , he said . while many online gamblers run special computer programs to analyze their chances , keiner prefers to rely on his own skills and experience . internet opens door to addiction beginners , however , can get themselves into serious debt by overestimating their abilities - and mistaking luck for skill . psychologist tobias hayer from the university of bremen , who specializes in gambling addiction , said that online poker has considerably lowered the threshold for compulsion . " there 's no social monitoring anymore , " hayer said . and there 's no legal monitoring either .
online poker is still immune from criminal prosecution as lawyers continue to debate its legal definition .
the game is a mix of calculable and incalculable elements , so is it gambling or a sport ? on the web , users can play against boris becker .
but in real life the tennis pro turned spokesman has n't had much success at the poker table , despite professional coaching .
at the " boris is back " finale in berlin in early march , he was eliminated after the first round . vera moeller-holtkamp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .

that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?

i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .

db 's many initiatives demonstrate just the opposite . " train to end tour at auschwitz the exhibit , which focuses on the plight of deported children , displays photos and film excerpts of survivors who describe their deportation experience .

amid the uproar , some are asking : where 's the crime ? " at no point was germany or any federal agency involved in organizing or carrying out training sessions in libya , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm on monday , april 7 . he admitted that a private security company may have trained members of libyan president muammar gaddafi 's special forces . thirty current and former police officers and soldiers are suspected of instructing libyan police during their vacation time and without the knowledge of their superiors , according to a flurry of media reports over the last several days .
they were paid an estimated 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- each for their services . the firm bdb protection , which no longer exists , reportedly informed the german embassy in tripoli of its training seminars .

he said , however , that germany and libya had cooperated over the past several years on security issues , including counter-terrorism , organized crime and drug smuggling . the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag reported that schroeder had made an arrangement with gaddafi in 2003 to repay libya for negotiating the release of three german hostages kidnapped by muslim militants in the philippines . schroeder , the foreign ministry and the bnd , germany 's foreign intelligence service , have denied the allegation .
the former chancellor has threatened to sue the paper for what he claims is a falsified report . press divided on whether to be appalled as politicians across the spectrum demand an explanation from authorities and a thorough investigation , the daily berliner morgenpost in its tuesday edition asked , " where 's the scandal ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .

i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "

you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "

are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.04.2008 olympic torch relays perfect stage for protests , papers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security officials extinguished the torch four times amid raucous protests in paris olympics leaders are to review this week whether the torch relays ahead of the games should continue given global protests .
but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .
unfortunately , beijing has gone in the other direction . " the united states plays a central role in it all , and yet washington has remained utterly silent about the possibility of an olympic boycott .
one reason is that the us has become inordinately dependent financially on china of late .
financial concerns are americans ' priority now , " the paper speculated . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid the uproar , some are asking : where 's the crime ? " at no point was germany or any federal agency involved in organizing or carrying out training sessions in libya , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm on monday , april 7 . he admitted that a private security company may have trained members of libyan president muammar gaddafi 's special forces . thirty current and former police officers and soldiers are suspected of instructing libyan police during their vacation time and without the knowledge of their superiors , according to a flurry of media reports over the last several days .
they were paid an estimated 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- each for their services . the firm bdb protection , which no longer exists , reportedly informed the german embassy in tripoli of its training seminars .
the precise nature of the information disclosed is under investigation .
it is unclear whether the clandestine activities constitute a crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , pictured here with gaddafi in 2004 , said they did n't make a police training deal state prosecutors in north rhine-westphalia have begun preliminary investigation into eight police officers from that state ; one faces criminal charges of divulging classified information .
a berlin-based sergeant in the german military has also been suspended from duty due to suspected involvement in the affair , the defense department said . accusations against schroeder rebutted wilhelm also denied reports that then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had made a deal with gaddafi to provide police training .
he said , however , that germany and libya had cooperated over the past several years on security issues , including counter-terrorism , organized crime and drug smuggling . the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag reported that schroeder had made an arrangement with gaddafi in 2003 to repay libya for negotiating the release of three german hostages kidnapped by muslim militants in the philippines . schroeder , the foreign ministry and the bnd , germany 's foreign intelligence service , have denied the allegation .
the former chancellor has threatened to sue the paper for what he claims is a falsified report . press divided on whether to be appalled as politicians across the spectrum demand an explanation from authorities and a thorough investigation , the daily berliner morgenpost in its tuesday edition asked , " where 's the scandal ? " on the one hand , we accuse our secret service of not having any good contacts , but on the other hand , we complain when they develop some .

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .

organizers insist the deportation exhibit ahould be shown in the busy hub . the train of commemoration , a mobile memorial to holocaust victims , has been passing through train stations in germany since early november .
it is set to arrive in the german capital on sunday , april 13 , for a 10-day stay at five stations .

" the holocaust was thought out and planned in the german capital , " said wowereit in a statement published on the train of commemoration web site .
" berlin 's jews were systematically brought by the nazis to death camps - and by train . especially in berlin , it must be possible for a commendable memorial project like the train of commemoration to receive every kind of support in our city . " protest march planned in berlin project organizers have planned protest on saturday at the brandenburg gate in central berlin , followed by a silent march to the nearby deutsche bahn headquarters . according to die welt newspaper , authorities are examining the legitimacy of the train company 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's route covers 60 stations and 6,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- the president of the international auschwitz committee , noach flug , said " deutsche bahn 's undignified stance toward such an important civic project damages germany 's reputation and serves to encourage right-wing extremism in europe .

db 's many initiatives demonstrate just the opposite . " train to end tour at auschwitz the exhibit , which focuses on the plight of deported children , displays photos and film excerpts of survivors who describe their deportation experience .
after berlin , the train of commemoration is set to continue on to six other german cities before crossing over into poland . on may 8 , the anniversary of the end of the war in germany , the exhibit will arrive in auschwitz , one of the nazis ' most deadly concentration camps . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.04.2008 german pension hike draws criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pension hike is great news for some chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided tuesday , april 8 to boost pensions for 20 million germans , shrugging off criticism by employers that the rise would cost jobs . nearly one in four germans will benefit from a 1.1 percent pension raise starting july , but the hike means millions of working-age germans will have to forego planned reductions in their monthly contributions to state-run pension funds .
the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he confirmed that officials would discuss the relay in meetings planned this week after the disruptive protests in london and paris .
" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the demonstrators accuse the chinese government of violating human rights during its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.04.2008 german pension hike draws criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pension hike is great news for some chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided tuesday , april 8 to boost pensions for 20 million germans , shrugging off criticism by employers that the rise would cost jobs . nearly one in four germans will benefit from a 1.1 percent pension raise starting july , but the hike means millions of working-age germans will have to forego planned reductions in their monthly contributions to state-run pension funds .
the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.04.2008 german pension hike draws criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pension hike is great news for some chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided tuesday , april 8 to boost pensions for 20 million germans , shrugging off criticism by employers that the rise would cost jobs . nearly one in four germans will benefit from a 1.1 percent pension raise starting july , but the hike means millions of working-age germans will have to forego planned reductions in their monthly contributions to state-run pension funds .
the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .

during the nazi era , huge numbers of eastern europeans were forced to do factory or farm work at low pay , replacing millions of men conscripted into hitler 's army .
employers that are still in existence today have contributed to compensation trusts .
the church decided to expose its own guilt in greater detail , commissioning a 700-page historical study of the 4,829 laborers and 1,075 prisoners of war it had obtained from the nazi labor office .
the main historian , karl-joseph hummel , said only a limited number of catholic facilities had used forced labor , and at the same time , the nazis had been persecuting the church .
most laborers did not work in churches , but typically in catholic hospitals and cemeteries , on farms run by monasteries or in domestic service .
according to the study , most hailed from poland , ukraine and the soviet union .
church failed to speak out in a radio interview , hummel said the church had failed by not speaking out clearly against the nazi regime .
" it should have clearly said how its interpretation of loyalty , honor and the fatherland was not the same as the nazis ' view , " he said .
the german catholic bishops ' conference said it had also spent 2.71 million euros on 200 reconciliation projects in eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.04.2008 olympic torch relays perfect stage for protests , papers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security officials extinguished the torch four times amid raucous protests in paris olympics leaders are to review this week whether the torch relays ahead of the games should continue given global protests .
but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .
unfortunately , beijing has gone in the other direction . " the united states plays a central role in it all , and yet washington has remained utterly silent about the possibility of an olympic boycott .
one reason is that the us has become inordinately dependent financially on china of late .
financial concerns are americans ' priority now , " the paper speculated . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he confirmed that officials would discuss the relay in meetings planned this week after the disruptive protests in london and paris .
" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the demonstrators accuse the chinese government of violating human rights during its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .

the torch is due to visit 19 countries plus china along a 137,000 kilometer -lrb- 85,000 mile -rrb- journey .
" the disruption and sabotage of the torch relay is a challenge to the spirit of the olympic charter , the world laws , and peace-loving people around the world , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
france hints at boycott french president nicolas sarkozy said tuesday that france 's participation in the olympic games would be linked to china starting talks with exiled tibetan leader , the dalai lama .
" it is according to the resumption of this dialogue that i will determine the conditions of our participation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay in paris was dogged by protests " the dalai lama himself is not asking for a boycott of the olympic games but now it is necessary that they talk and that we avoid the olympic flame being taken hostage by matters that are extremely worrying , " he said on a trip to the southwestern french town of cahors .
german parliament to debate on thursday on thursday , germany 's parliamentarians will have the opportunity to discuss the torch relay in the presence of invited guest , manfred von richthofen , honorary president of the german olympic sports association .
in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk , richthofen described the torch relay to china as an " embarrassing spectacle . "
" i 'm very sorry for both sides , but you have to ask yourself whether this torch relay makes any sense when it comes to the preparations for the olympics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .

but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?

i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.04.2008 candidate wants to represent expats like herself in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini kicked off her campaign in berlin in mid-march italian laura garavini has lived in germany for 20 years , but is running for parliament in rome , with the aim of representing italians abroad from london to vladivostok . laura garavini , 41 , has not lived in italy since she left for germany two decades ago . but she 's hoping to soon have a seat in her native country 's parliament , running on the center-left democratic party ticket .
expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .

amid the uproar , some are asking : where 's the crime ? " at no point was germany or any federal agency involved in organizing or carrying out training sessions in libya , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm on monday , april 7 . he admitted that a private security company may have trained members of libyan president muammar gaddafi 's special forces . thirty current and former police officers and soldiers are suspected of instructing libyan police during their vacation time and without the knowledge of their superiors , according to a flurry of media reports over the last several days .
they were paid an estimated 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- each for their services . the firm bdb protection , which no longer exists , reportedly informed the german embassy in tripoli of its training seminars .
the precise nature of the information disclosed is under investigation .
it is unclear whether the clandestine activities constitute a crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , pictured here with gaddafi in 2004 , said they did n't make a police training deal state prosecutors in north rhine-westphalia have begun preliminary investigation into eight police officers from that state ; one faces criminal charges of divulging classified information .
a berlin-based sergeant in the german military has also been suspended from duty due to suspected involvement in the affair , the defense department said . accusations against schroeder rebutted wilhelm also denied reports that then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had made a deal with gaddafi to provide police training .
he said , however , that germany and libya had cooperated over the past several years on security issues , including counter-terrorism , organized crime and drug smuggling . the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag reported that schroeder had made an arrangement with gaddafi in 2003 to repay libya for negotiating the release of three german hostages kidnapped by muslim militants in the philippines . schroeder , the foreign ministry and the bnd , germany 's foreign intelligence service , have denied the allegation .
the former chancellor has threatened to sue the paper for what he claims is a falsified report . press divided on whether to be appalled as politicians across the spectrum demand an explanation from authorities and a thorough investigation , the daily berliner morgenpost in its tuesday edition asked , " where 's the scandal ?

db 's many initiatives demonstrate just the opposite . " train to end tour at auschwitz the exhibit , which focuses on the plight of deported children , displays photos and film excerpts of survivors who describe their deportation experience .
after berlin , the train of commemoration is set to continue on to six other german cities before crossing over into poland . on may 8 , the anniversary of the end of the war in germany , the exhibit will arrive in auschwitz , one of the nazis ' most deadly concentration camps . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers insist the deportation exhibit ahould be shown in the busy hub . the train of commemoration , a mobile memorial to holocaust victims , has been passing through train stations in germany since early november .
it is set to arrive in the german capital on sunday , april 13 , for a 10-day stay at five stations .
but deutsche bahn has dubbed the central station off-limits for the privately organized exhibit , citing heavy traffic . organizers have rejected the smaller stations that deutsche bahn offered as an alternative . in a statement issued on monday , april 7 , the international auschwitz committee said it was " angered " by deutsche bahn 's decision : " both the financial conditions and the barring of important train stations for the train of commemoration are incomprehensible and unacceptable . " bahn rents tracks for high price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's central station opened in may 2006 an ongoing conflict over what the organization is to pay deutsche bahn for the use of exhibition space at stations throughout germany remains unresolved , though fees are estimated to total between 70,000 and 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 110,000 to $ 157,000 -rrb- . berlin mayor klaus wowereit urged deutsche bahn to find an appropriate place in the central station for the exhibit . " the holocaust was thought out and planned in the german capital , " said wowereit in a statement published on the train of commemoration web site .

" protest march planned in berlin project organizers have planned protest on saturday at the brandenburg gate in central berlin , followed by a silent march to the nearby deutsche bahn headquarters . according to die welt newspaper , authorities are examining the legitimacy of the train company 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train 's route covers 60 stations and 6,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,700 miles -rrb- the president of the international auschwitz committee , noach flug , said " deutsche bahn 's undignified stance toward such an important civic project damages germany 's reputation and serves to encourage right-wing extremism in europe .

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .

the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the demonstrators accuse the chinese government of violating human rights during its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .
all that helps give people the desire to go out and vote . interview : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers insist the deportation exhibit ahould be shown in the busy hub . the train of commemoration , a mobile memorial to holocaust victims , has been passing through train stations in germany since early november .
it is set to arrive in the german capital on sunday , april 13 , for a 10-day stay at five stations .
but deutsche bahn has dubbed the central station off-limits for the privately organized exhibit , citing heavy traffic . organizers have rejected the smaller stations that deutsche bahn offered as an alternative . in a statement issued on monday , april 7 , the international auschwitz committee said it was " angered " by deutsche bahn 's decision : " both the financial conditions and the barring of important train stations for the train of commemoration are incomprehensible and unacceptable .

but olympic officials hint the tradition might be abandoned . protests over olympic host china 's human rights record were in full swing even before the olympic torch touched down in san francisco on tuesday , april 8 .
on monday , three activists climbed the city 's famous golden gate bridge to hang huge pro-tibet banners .
san francisco 's mayor , gavin newsom , said he was anticipating security problems , and that the route for the torch relay would be subject to last minute changes if need be .
meanwhile , olympic officials in beijing hinted for the first time at the option of abandoning subsequent legs of the torch relay .
last torch relay ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president , belgian jacques rogge ioc president jacques rogge said he was saddened by the protests in london and paris around the torch relay for the beijing games but did not want to join speculation on the future of the symbolic event .
he confirmed that officials would discuss the relay in meetings planned this week after the disruptive protests in london and paris .
" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the demonstrators accuse the chinese government of violating human rights during its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates at an ioc meeting in beijing on tuesday condemned the protests chinese officials have balked at the prospect of cutting short the most ambitious torch relay ever staged .
the torch is due to visit 19 countries plus china along a 137,000 kilometer -lrb- 85,000 mile -rrb- journey .
" the disruption and sabotage of the torch relay is a challenge to the spirit of the olympic charter , the world laws , and peace-loving people around the world , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
france hints at boycott french president nicolas sarkozy said tuesday that france 's participation in the olympic games would be linked to china starting talks with exiled tibetan leader , the dalai lama .
" it is according to the resumption of this dialogue that i will determine the conditions of our participation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay in paris was dogged by protests " the dalai lama himself is not asking for a boycott of the olympic games but now it is necessary that they talk and that we avoid the olympic flame being taken hostage by matters that are extremely worrying , " he said on a trip to the southwestern french town of cahors .
german parliament to debate on thursday on thursday , germany 's parliamentarians will have the opportunity to discuss the torch relay in the presence of invited guest , manfred von richthofen , honorary president of the german olympic sports association .
in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk , richthofen described the torch relay to china as an " embarrassing spectacle . "
" i 'm very sorry for both sides , but you have to ask yourself whether this torch relay makes any sense when it comes to the preparations for the olympics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .
unfortunately , beijing has gone in the other direction . " the united states plays a central role in it all , and yet washington has remained utterly silent about the possibility of an olympic boycott .
one reason is that the us has become inordinately dependent financially on china of late .
financial concerns are americans ' priority now , " the paper speculated . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amid the uproar , some are asking : where 's the crime ? " at no point was germany or any federal agency involved in organizing or carrying out training sessions in libya , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm on monday , april 7 . he admitted that a private security company may have trained members of libyan president muammar gaddafi 's special forces . thirty current and former police officers and soldiers are suspected of instructing libyan police during their vacation time and without the knowledge of their superiors , according to a flurry of media reports over the last several days .
they were paid an estimated 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- each for their services . the firm bdb protection , which no longer exists , reportedly informed the german embassy in tripoli of its training seminars .
the precise nature of the information disclosed is under investigation .
it is unclear whether the clandestine activities constitute a crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , pictured here with gaddafi in 2004 , said they did n't make a police training deal state prosecutors in north rhine-westphalia have begun preliminary investigation into eight police officers from that state ; one faces criminal charges of divulging classified information .
a berlin-based sergeant in the german military has also been suspended from duty due to suspected involvement in the affair , the defense department said . accusations against schroeder rebutted wilhelm also denied reports that then-chancellor gerhard schroeder had made a deal with gaddafi to provide police training .
he said , however , that germany and libya had cooperated over the past several years on security issues , including counter-terrorism , organized crime and drug smuggling . the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag reported that schroeder had made an arrangement with gaddafi in 2003 to repay libya for negotiating the release of three german hostages kidnapped by muslim militants in the philippines . schroeder , the foreign ministry and the bnd , germany 's foreign intelligence service , have denied the allegation .
the former chancellor has threatened to sue the paper for what he claims is a falsified report . press divided on whether to be appalled as politicians across the spectrum demand an explanation from authorities and a thorough investigation , the daily berliner morgenpost in its tuesday edition asked , " where 's the scandal ? " on the one hand , we accuse our secret service of not having any good contacts , but on the other hand , we complain when they develop some .
what 's the matter with a former rogue country slowly being brought back to relative normalcy ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaddafi has come under fire for human rights abuses in libya it 's reassuring that the libyans were trained according to german security standards , and not american , russian , or chinese , " opined the paper . die frankfurter rundschau , on the other hand , wrote on tuesday that " the democratic state should not let its power monopoly be challenged - either by demonstrators within its borders or by active or former public ' servants ' who sell abroad for profit what they learned on the job . " the state has to be able to decide who it wants to support with its security expertise , " concluded the paper : " it owes it to its superiors - the people . " talks planned in german parliament libya was added to the united states ' list of state sponsors of terrorism after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , but removed in 2006 .
formerly considered a pariah state , it has more recently renounced terrorism and improved relations with the west .

amid the uproar , some are asking : where 's the crime ? " at no point was germany or any federal agency involved in organizing or carrying out training sessions in libya , " said government spokesman ulrich wilhelm on monday , april 7 . he admitted that a private security company may have trained members of libyan president muammar gaddafi 's special forces . thirty current and former police officers and soldiers are suspected of instructing libyan police during their vacation time and without the knowledge of their superiors , according to a flurry of media reports over the last several days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.04.2008 german pension hike draws criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pension hike is great news for some chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet decided tuesday , april 8 to boost pensions for 20 million germans , shrugging off criticism by employers that the rise would cost jobs . nearly one in four germans will benefit from a 1.1 percent pension raise starting july , but the hike means millions of working-age germans will have to forego planned reductions in their monthly contributions to state-run pension funds .
the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 08.04.2008 olympic torch relays perfect stage for protests , papers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security officials extinguished the torch four times amid raucous protests in paris olympics leaders are to review this week whether the torch relays ahead of the games should continue given global protests .
but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .
unfortunately , beijing has gone in the other direction . " the united states plays a central role in it all , and yet washington has remained utterly silent about the possibility of an olympic boycott .
one reason is that the us has become inordinately dependent financially on china of late .
financial concerns are americans ' priority now , " the paper speculated . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .

" the disruption and sabotage of the torch relay is a challenge to the spirit of the olympic charter , the world laws , and peace-loving people around the world , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
france hints at boycott french president nicolas sarkozy said tuesday that france 's participation in the olympic games would be linked to china starting talks with exiled tibetan leader , the dalai lama .
" it is according to the resumption of this dialogue that i will determine the conditions of our participation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay in paris was dogged by protests " the dalai lama himself is not asking for a boycott of the olympic games but now it is necessary that they talk and that we avoid the olympic flame being taken hostage by matters that are extremely worrying , " he said on a trip to the southwestern french town of cahors .
german parliament to debate on thursday on thursday , germany 's parliamentarians will have the opportunity to discuss the torch relay in the presence of invited guest , manfred von richthofen , honorary president of the german olympic sports association .
in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk , richthofen described the torch relay to china as an " embarrassing spectacle . "
" i 'm very sorry for both sides , but you have to ask yourself whether this torch relay makes any sense when it comes to the preparations for the olympics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed hike from july 1 will allow older generations to share in germany 's recent economic upswing , the ministry for labor and social affairs said .
government economists said the propose hike will cost 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- between this summer and the end of 2012 .
a minority in merkel 's own christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have loudly criticized the pension raise , charging that it was bulldozed through by merkel 's more leftist coalition partner , the social democrats .
another raise of around 2 percent is expected next year .
" it 's going to hit employment " the pension rise has been attacked by employers in particular who say it violates restrictions on pension increases set out in a formula adopted under previous chancellor gerhard schroeder .
it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expatriate italians have the right to elect their own lawmakers in rome , from four " super-constituencies " - europe , north and central america , latin america and africa-asia-oceania .
some 430,000 italians live in germany . italians head to the polls on april 14 and 15 to elect a new leader , although italians abroad must vote by mail ahead of that .
garavini 's democratic party is headed by walter veltroni , rome 's mayor from 2001 to 2008 .
veltroni is facing silvio berlusconi , who has been italian prime minister twice .
for the past several months , garavini has been on the road nearly constantly , trying to speak to as many italians abroad as she possibly can . dw-world.de : your electoral district is fairly large , to say the least .
it stretches from lisbon to eastern russia .
how much have you traveled this week ? laura garavini : i made stops in london , amsterdam , belgium , france and germany .
of course , it 's not really possible to conduct a traditional campaign when you have such a large area to cover since it 's impossible to be everywhere .
for my calendar , i 've tried to schedule a mix of big cities and smaller locations .
that 's where my internet site comes in and allows me to maintain contact to the voters who communicate with me through e-mail .
that takes up a lot of energy and time , but it 's incredibly important to reach people , either personally or through the internet . the concerns of italians living in london must be quite different than the concerns of those living in , say , istanbul . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura garavini definitely , there are very big differences , which has a lot to do with the historical reasons behind emigration to different countries .
for example , at my events in london , i see a lot of people who are part of the " new emigration " phenomenon .
that is , highly educated young people who have come to london for professional reasons .
on the other hand , there are countries where many of the italians left italy in the 1950s or 60s to look for work .
that means the problems they have or policies they 'd like to see enacted in rome are completely different . you have invested a lot of your own money into this campaign and have a grueling schedule .
what motivates you to do this ? i am convinced that in this election italy is poised on the brink of a new era .
with the democratic party of walter veltroni , italy has the opportunity to radically modernize itself .
we can bring about an economic boom that would also help further social justice .
we could help bring more young people and women into the political process and spark a real renewal in the country .
i think it 's important that one is ready to personally engage oneself in pursuit of this goal .
that 's why i am a candidate . are you also worried that italy is about to see another berlusconi era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi , right , and national alliance party leader gianfranco fini officially launch their election campaign unfortunately , there is that risk .
that 's why it 's so important that during these last days before the election , we do everything we can to talk to the people and make it clear to them how much we italians abroad and those in italy suffered under berlusconi .
we had to endure embarrassment almost everyday from some stupid joke or gesture he made , such as when he described martin schulz , a german member of the european parliament , as a nazi concentration camp guard .
such things were not only irritating , but they made us feel ashamed . berlusconi only pursued policies that were in his own interest or benefited his friends or family .
we want to do the opposite .
the democratic party wants to have a government that is for everybody , bringing the interests of all individuals to the forefront , not just those of society 's biggest winners . what will your priorities be if you win your campaign ? i want to work on policies that promote the integration of italians who live abroad .
for example , there are already counseling services for italians throughout europe .
but they 're often focused on questions about pensions when they could address a whole range of issues that concern italians abroad and help the integration process along . regarding integration , when one hears about integration problems , germany 's turkish population is usually the subject .
italians are considered by many as well integrated in germany .
but is that actually true ? one assumes that italians are well integrated , but in reality italian children are more often put in remedial education programs than turks are .
the unemployment rate among italians is double the rate it is among germans and almost as high as it is among turks . while integration problems with turks or other minority groups in germany is known , it 's underestimated regarding italians . are there still prejudices against italians in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the launch of the " mafia ?
no thanks ! " initiative they do still exist .
i am the initiator of a campaign called " mafia ?
no thanks ! "
i started this campaign for several reasons , one of which was that after the attacks in duisburg -lsb- six men were killed last year in what is believed to have been a mafia-related feud . -rsb- these old prejudices gained new strength .
you could read lines in the newspaper such as " where there 's pizza , there 's the mafia . "
those are , of course , ridiculous stereotypes that have no basis in reality . you have traveled a great deal and spoken with many italians who live abroad .
are they interested and excited about this election ? yes , in the those places where i 've been able to sit down and talk with people , i leave with a very good feeling .
at the start of our conversation , they often express their disappointment , saying , " oh , nothing will change , we 've heard it all before , " and " here we go again , another government crisis . "
but when you take the time to explain what concrete progress the prodi government has made in the last two years , and what the democratic party has in mind and how serious it is about its goal of national renewal , and then they see me , a young women who has worked for integration for 20 years and started an anti-mafia initiative .

it was intended to ease the strain on germany 's social security system caused by its ageing population .
germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the world .
state pensions are funded by fixed contributions split between workers and employers .
dieter hundt , president of germany 's employers ' federation -lrb- bda -rrb- , said it was wrong to break with the formula just because a general election was coming up in 2009 .
" the consequence of this will be higher staffing costs for employers and less money in the pockets of workers , " he said .
" that 's going to hit employment . "
the pension rise means workers and employers must both shoulder a further 2.5 billion euros in costs in 2011 , and 1.7 billion euros in 2012 , the government said .
the federal budget will be saddled with about an extra 2 billion euros in 2011 .
the planned increases mean the contribution rate to statutory pension insurance will not be cut from 19.9 percent of gross wages until 2012 , a year later than previously envisaged .
government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said tuesday cabinet had been unanimous that old-age pensioners should be given their deserved share of germany 's recent economic growth .
state pensions pegged to lifetime earnings are the main income of germans over 65 , though affluent people also have capital income or company pensions to draw on .
a poll for n24 television found 74 per cent of germans approved the raise for pensioners , while 17 disapproved and believed younger germans were being disadvantaged to improve the incomes of seniors . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but olympic officials hint the tradition might be abandoned . protests over olympic host china 's human rights record were in full swing even before the olympic torch touched down in san francisco on tuesday , april 8 .
on monday , three activists climbed the city 's famous golden gate bridge to hang huge pro-tibet banners .
san francisco 's mayor , gavin newsom , said he was anticipating security problems , and that the route for the torch relay would be subject to last minute changes if need be .
meanwhile , olympic officials in beijing hinted for the first time at the option of abandoning subsequent legs of the torch relay .
last torch relay ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president , belgian jacques rogge ioc president jacques rogge said he was saddened by the protests in london and paris around the torch relay for the beijing games but did not want to join speculation on the future of the symbolic event .
he confirmed that officials would discuss the relay in meetings planned this week after the disruptive protests in london and paris .
" we will discuss this and we will see what we have to do now that we have had six or seven legs , " rogge told reporters .
" we will see what kind of conclusions we have to take from that . "
according to reports by the german news agency dpa , officials have already determined that , in future , there will no longer be an international torch relay .
anger over china 's actions in tibet pro-tibet activists have determinedly shadowed the torch from the moment it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the demonstrators accuse the chinese government of violating human rights during its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates at an ioc meeting in beijing on tuesday condemned the protests chinese officials have balked at the prospect of cutting short the most ambitious torch relay ever staged .
the torch is due to visit 19 countries plus china along a 137,000 kilometer -lrb- 85,000 mile -rrb- journey .
" the disruption and sabotage of the torch relay is a challenge to the spirit of the olympic charter , the world laws , and peace-loving people around the world , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said .
france hints at boycott french president nicolas sarkozy said tuesday that france 's participation in the olympic games would be linked to china starting talks with exiled tibetan leader , the dalai lama .
" it is according to the resumption of this dialogue that i will determine the conditions of our participation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay in paris was dogged by protests " the dalai lama himself is not asking for a boycott of the olympic games but now it is necessary that they talk and that we avoid the olympic flame being taken hostage by matters that are extremely worrying , " he said on a trip to the southwestern french town of cahors .
german parliament to debate on thursday on thursday , germany 's parliamentarians will have the opportunity to discuss the torch relay in the presence of invited guest , manfred von richthofen , honorary president of the german olympic sports association .
in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandfunk , richthofen described the torch relay to china as an " embarrassing spectacle . "
" i 'm very sorry for both sides , but you have to ask yourself whether this torch relay makes any sense when it comes to the preparations for the olympics , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the demonstrations , european papers said , are the true expression of freedom . beijing olympic organizers vowed on tuesday , april 8 , that the torch relay would go ahead as planned .
since the flame-lighting ceremony in athens , greece , on march 24 , numerous protests have disrupted relay festivities in other cities , such as in london and paris .
activists in san francisco have vowed to stage even larger demonstrations . the protests are a response to china 's controversial rule of tibet and a crackdown on anti-chinese protests there , as well as china 's human rights record . european commentators said the protests during the relays are sending their own important message . cologne 's daily koelner stadt-anzeiger said the demonstrations in london and paris set the tone .
" now we know that the torch relay headed to beijing makes sense and is warranted .
it can be used to show support for freedom and peace , which should be a part of the global sporting event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan youths during protests in india at the end of march " it is scandalous to see that sports functionaries - not only in china , but also in germany and other counties - virtually dread the thought of their political responsibility , " the paper continued .
" such a stance runs contradictory to the spirit of the olympic games .
it 's an encouraging development when the public does not go along with attempts to obscure the problem , but instead , takes a political stand . " germany 's business daily handelsblatt noted that " china 's olympic organizers are kidding themselves if they think the torch relay with the olympic flame is to be a journey of peace around the world .
even the opening ceremonies for the torch at tiananmen square in beijing were anything but harmonious , given the army of security personnel overseeing the event . the relays across five continents could turn into actual gauntlets for the runners should the protests against china 's human rights policies continue , " the paper observed .
" one should therefore not do china the favor of returning to business as usual .
and even if a boycott of the olympics is out of the question , that does not mean western politicians should kowtow before the mandarins in beijing during the opening ceremonies of the games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police tackle a demonstrator during the olympic torch relay in london " the olympic games are threatening to become the penultimate worst case scenario in press relations for the people 's republic , especially considering they were supposed to demonstrate china 's major advancements into the modern age , " vienna 's der standard quipped .
" demonstrators have plenty of opportunity until august 6 - the day the olympic flame is to reach beijing - to gain major visibility for their global protests . " china 's ruling system , normally so focused on merciless planning and steely control , does not even seem to grasp what 's going on .
almost mechanically , chinese functionaries refer to the ' dalai clique ' which is supposedly behind the worldwide protests .
beijing has no idea how to deal with citizens or reporters -lrb- without borders -rrb- who are accustomed to freely expressing their opinions and disrupting sanctimonious events and , in this way , are upholding the true torches of liberty .
that that is now so clearly coming to light is the best thing about these olympic games . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics committee 's executive board met in beijing tuesday paris 's le figaro predicted that " … the regime in beijing will use all the ruckus to draw the reins of its dictatorship even tighter .
the people of tibet will suffer from that , but also all the millions of chinese who are kept in a permanent state of anxiety and whose nationalism will be stoked as a counter-agent to any outside influence as soon as it presents itself as a danger .
in china 's eyes , it was not human rights activists who demonstrated on monday in paris , but instead , dangerous , uneducated , immoral savages .
enemies of sports , peace and fraternalism .
the message has thus been turned around , " the paper commented . madrid-based el pais pointed out that " the large number of demonstrators rebut china 's claim that the protests are being directed by a few tibetan separatists .
the olympic games should not alone be a reflection of modern china .
they also present an opportunity for china to show itself to be politically open .
unfortunately , beijing has gone in the other direction . " the united states plays a central role in it all , and yet washington has remained utterly silent about the possibility of an olympic boycott .
one reason is that the us has become inordinately dependent financially on china of late .
financial concerns are americans ' priority now , " the paper speculated . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , a report by the department for regional development , said a high class bus-based network could cut commuting times while costing significantly less .
regional development minister conor murphy said a new bus network for belfast was affordable and realistic .
northern ireland taxpayers now look set to invest more than £ 100m .
however , it will not be in the light rail system which has proved so popular in dublin .
instead of the £ 590m needed to establish a light rail network , the consultants say a high quality bus-based system with vehicles carrying 120 passengers , could be built for close to a quarter of the cost at £ 147m .
belfast , it seems , simply does not have the density of population to justify a railway network in the city .
the report suggests that running a luas style service in belfast would cost taxpayers £ 6.78m annually , while investing in the large flexi-buses which many european cities have opted for would cost £ 1.44m to run each year .
the study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results , but light rail does not .
this is because the likely numbers of passengers do not warrant the extra cost of light rail .
the report by atkins & kpmg , however , said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase .
mr murphy says it was a service that should be segregated from other traffic as much as possible with new vehicle designs that enhance the journey and reflect belfast as a 21st century city .
pilot routes three pilot routes are suggested , running from dundonald in the east to the city centre , to one serving the development in titanic quarter and onwards to queen 's university and the city hospital and thirdly one into the west from the city centre to the royal victoria hospital and beyond into west belfast .
officials are stressing that the three routes represent a start .
further lines could be added in the future .
at peak times the high-tech buses would carry just over 3,000 commuters per hour .
the department for regional development believes commuters will be attracted by a service where buses depart every five minutes and offer a fast , comfortable and inexpensive journey to and from the centre of town .
the minister is stressing that no decision has yet been made on which high speed transit network he will recommend to his ministerial colleagues .
the publication of this report though suggests the executive is likely to favour the bus-based network .
stakeholders such as translink , which is building up its metro service , now have six weeks to comment on the report .

instead , a report by the department for regional development , said a high class bus-based network could cut commuting times while costing significantly less .
regional development minister conor murphy said a new bus network for belfast was affordable and realistic .
northern ireland taxpayers now look set to invest more than £ 100m .
however , it will not be in the light rail system which has proved so popular in dublin .
instead of the £ 590m needed to establish a light rail network , the consultants say a high quality bus-based system with vehicles carrying 120 passengers , could be built for close to a quarter of the cost at £ 147m .
belfast , it seems , simply does not have the density of population to justify a railway network in the city .
the report suggests that running a luas style service in belfast would cost taxpayers £ 6.78m annually , while investing in the large flexi-buses which many european cities have opted for would cost £ 1.44m to run each year .
the study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results , but light rail does not .
this is because the likely numbers of passengers do not warrant the extra cost of light rail .
the report by atkins & kpmg , however , said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase .
mr murphy says it was a service that should be segregated from other traffic as much as possible with new vehicle designs that enhance the journey and reflect belfast as a 21st century city .
pilot routes three pilot routes are suggested , running from dundonald in the east to the city centre , to one serving the development in titanic quarter and onwards to queen 's university and the city hospital and thirdly one into the west from the city centre to the royal victoria hospital and beyond into west belfast .
officials are stressing that the three routes represent a start .
further lines could be added in the future .
at peak times the high-tech buses would carry just over 3,000 commuters per hour .
the department for regional development believes commuters will be attracted by a service where buses depart every five minutes and offer a fast , comfortable and inexpensive journey to and from the centre of town .
the minister is stressing that no decision has yet been made on which high speed transit network he will recommend to his ministerial colleagues .
the publication of this report though suggests the executive is likely to favour the bus-based network .
stakeholders such as translink , which is building up its metro service , now have six weeks to comment on the report .

instead , a report by the department for regional development , said a high class bus-based network could cut commuting times while costing significantly less .
regional development minister conor murphy said a new bus network for belfast was affordable and realistic .
northern ireland taxpayers now look set to invest more than £ 100m .
however , it will not be in the light rail system which has proved so popular in dublin .
instead of the £ 590m needed to establish a light rail network , the consultants say a high quality bus-based system with vehicles carrying 120 passengers , could be built for close to a quarter of the cost at £ 147m .
belfast , it seems , simply does not have the density of population to justify a railway network in the city .
the report suggests that running a luas style service in belfast would cost taxpayers £ 6.78m annually , while investing in the large flexi-buses which many european cities have opted for would cost £ 1.44m to run each year .
the study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results , but light rail does not .
this is because the likely numbers of passengers do not warrant the extra cost of light rail .
the report by atkins & kpmg , however , said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase .
mr murphy says it was a service that should be segregated from other traffic as much as possible with new vehicle designs that enhance the journey and reflect belfast as a 21st century city .
pilot routes three pilot routes are suggested , running from dundonald in the east to the city centre , to one serving the development in titanic quarter and onwards to queen 's university and the city hospital and thirdly one into the west from the city centre to the royal victoria hospital and beyond into west belfast .
officials are stressing that the three routes represent a start .
further lines could be added in the future .
at peak times the high-tech buses would carry just over 3,000 commuters per hour .
the department for regional development believes commuters will be attracted by a service where buses depart every five minutes and offer a fast , comfortable and inexpensive journey to and from the centre of town .
the minister is stressing that no decision has yet been made on which high speed transit network he will recommend to his ministerial colleagues .
the publication of this report though suggests the executive is likely to favour the bus-based network .
stakeholders such as translink , which is building up its metro service , now have six weeks to comment on the report .

rosie swale pope was just 60 miles from the east coast of the north atlantic island when she was injured .
the 61-year-old will have to rest for at least two weeks but is determined to resume as soon as possible .
she will announce details of the final leg of her run - from scotland to her home in tenby , pembrokeshire , shortly .
when setting out in october 2003 rosie predicted the run would only take her about 24 months but she has now been on the road for four-and-a-half years .
most nights have been spent sleeping in a tent she pulls behind her on a cart she has called icebird .
it will be about four to six weeks until everything is healed properly rosie swale pope in the latest entry on her website rosie said as she fell one of the cart 's shafts drove into her side and she heard " a cracking sound . "
a friend drove her to a medical centre where a doctor found she had broken ribs .
" i have broken two ribs at least near my spinal column , though not dangerous - not near a lung , and also have a bit of damage to the ribs at the front , " she said .
" the only catch is that he -lsb- the doctor -rsb- said setting immediately would make the injury less likely to heal quick and could cause more damage .
" i did not want to be hobbling on arrival in britain .
i want icebird and i to arrive proudly in fine style .
" high kicks " " so , it will be about four to six weeks until everything is healed properly , but if i use pain as a guide i ought to be able to set off with icebird again in around two weeks . "
until then she is camping out beside lake myvatn .
it is not the first injury rosie has sustained along the way .
during her journey she has been hit by a bus , suffered pneumonia , frost bite and a breast cancer scare .
she embarked on the challenge to increase awareness of prostate cancer following the death of her husband , clive pope , and to raise money for a russian children 's home in kitezh .
local newspapers and broadcasters have been covering her progress as she passes through their area for most of the journey .
" very definitely i 'll be bouncing 100 per cent and dancing and doing high kicks for joy as i reach the finish in tenby , " she added in her latest entry .
" i am getting more excited than ever about all this .
the ribs will make hardly any difference to the plans coming together , which i shall outline in my next report . "

but joe ledley has now gone further than his football hero when his match-winning goal sent the bluebirds to the fa cup final at wembley .
the 21-year-old 's friends , neighbours and teachers back home in the western cardiff suburb of fairwater say he has worked long and hard for that semi-final moment of glory .
as they helped the midfielder celebrate sunday 's 1-0 win over barnsley , they said it was a " dream come true " for ledley who , like his father , grew up a bluer-than-blue bluebirds fan .
" he was always dedicated , always playing football , " said adam carnell , who has been friends with ledley since the age of 11 .
he grew up around the corner from him , they both attended cantonian high school and both played for local side danescourt .
" when we were younger , we 'd go to call for him , but he 'd be off running to keep fit .
" graham kavanagh was his favourite player and he used to clean his boots when he started at city .
there will be people doing his now ! "
ledley played in cardiff city 's junior side from the age of nine before making his first team debut in september 2004 .

but the highlight of his career to date came when his ninth-minute volley put cardiff city into the fa cup final in front of 35,000 bluebirds supporters .
mr carnell , 21 , helped his old schoolmate celebrate at the no 10 nightclub in cardiff on sunday night after the team returned from london .
" joe could n't believe it .
it was a brilliant day - a dream come true for him .
he was still a bit shell-shocked , i think , " he said .
" but he wo n't let it go to his head .
he 's really down to earth and has a close-knit family - his mum , dad and older brother lee .
" they were almost in tears last night .
his dad has been a cardiff city fan since he was a young boy so to see his son score at wembley was something special . "
at his former school , cantonian high in fairwater , teachers and pupils praised the star , who still returns to visit .
matthew cook , ledley 's former pe teacher , said : " joe was exceptional , very good standard , very enthusiastic , and an excellent player , as you can see how he 's doing now .
" at school he was above the rest , he was very talented , very committed , very hard-working and a pleasure to teach .
" he 's a local lad ; he has been back in school a few times .
" he 's been in to sign autographs , he 's been in speaking to teachers and pupils . "
pupils rakesh bashal , declan church and joe wilson said they were proud of and inspired by ledley .
" lots of pupils in our school want to be like him and have his success , " said joe .
declan added : " i 'm proud for him to have been in our school , " while rakesh said : " he 's very inspiring and we want to follow in his footsteps . "
meanwhile , around fairwater , locals hailed the boy who became a hero overnight .
leeane ledley , who is joe 's cousin and works in the local lloyds pharmacy , where the footballer 's mother used to work , said : " i watched the game at home .
it was absolutely brilliant .
" my son 's eight and he 's a massive cardiff city fan .
the final is his auntie 's birthday so i am hoping that it is a good omen . "
" fame has n't gone to his head .
it 's a pleasure to the area to have someone of his calibre " allen collett , manager of the fairwater spar alison woolway , who also works at the pharmacy , said : " i 've known him since the age of three .
my son , they all were in the same school .
" when they were little they all played on the football team in danescourt .
when we had a refit in the shop he opened it for us -lsb- in october 2006 -rsb- . "
allen collett , 50 , the manager of spar in fairwater said : " i think he 's a credit to the area .
he 's a good role model to the area .
he 's always been a pleasant boy .
" it would be nice to see the other kids in the area follow his example .
he 's not big headed .
he 's very level headed .
" fame has n't gone to his head .
it 's a pleasure to the area to have someone of his calibre .
nas conway , who works in the spar , said : " my husband went up to the game with his son and they said there were lots of people up there from fairwater .
hopefully he can do it again in the final . "
marie watkins , who works in the co-op , added : " his parents must be very proud of him .

" good on him !
a great achievement for him . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- strategy set to tackle bovine tb bbc news / wales graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- magazine 06:07 gmt , tuesday , 8 april 2008 07:07 uk strategy set to tackle bovine tb wyre davies bbc wales correspondent wales has a huge problem with tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- in cattle - of that there can be no doubt .
last year more than £ 15m was paid out to farmers in compensation for cattle infected with tb and it is a figure which is rising steadily .
almost 8,000 cattle in wales were slaughtered in 2007 , because of tb , compared with less than 700 a decade ago .
but what , or who , is to blame ?
how is the problem tackled ?
later on tuesday the rural affairs minister , elin jones , will outline her response .
speak to most farmers and the answer is unequivocal .
the fault lies with badgers , killing them is the only answer .
yes , badgers may be native to the british countryside and have been around for thousands of years but , say farmers , they infect thousands of cattle with bovine tuberculosis , a potentially fatal respiratory illness which can ultimately be transmitted to humans .
john owen is a farm manager near llandeilo in carmarthenshire who happens to have a ' closed ' herd - one into which no cattle have been introduced in the last four years and which does not border another livestock farm .
yet he has just lost 150 dairy cattle to tb and although he will be compensated for the animals ' value , he will have to absorb thousands of pounds in lost income himself .
mr owen is a quietly spoken man and is not quick to blame badgers for something he says can not be definitely proven .
" it 's been devastating .
tb got into the herd somehow but no livestock was brought in and we test on a regular basis . "
mr owen would support a controlled cull of badgers within a limited , defined area as part of a wider strategy at tackling tb as would many vets who share the farming " perspective " .
that view , predictably and understandably , is not shared by groups who seek to protect badgers .
for more than 30 years gareth morgan has taken delight in watching and studying badgers at many setts in mid wales .
they are playful , intelligent creatures with a highly-developed social system .
gareth and other badger enthusiasts do not dispute they or other mammals can carry tb but say to blame and punish them for spreading the disease in cattle is simply wrong .
scientific evidence is inconclusive .
many reports back the farmers and the vets .
others , most notably a study carried out over 10 years by the independent scientific group -lrb- isg -rrb- suggest that a cull of badgers might not achieve a significant reduction of tb among cattle .
buoyed by the isg report , badger " huggers " as their detractors call them , say the real problem lies with modern , intensive farming .
thousands of animals , mechanically reared for optimum profit , living in close quarters spreading illness among each other .
foot and mouth , bluetongue and now tb .
proof enough say those hoping to save the badger .
those arguments certainly are not lost on the agriculture minister as she puts forward a comprehensive strategy today to deal with tb in wales .
this strategy is likely to include better and more rigorous testing of cattle .
the problem for ms jones is that any announcement to eradicate badgers within a defined area may go down well in the farming community but will be deeply unpopular among the general public .

last year more than £ 15m was paid out to farmers in compensation for cattle infected with tb and it is a figure which is rising steadily .
almost 8,000 cattle in wales were slaughtered in 2007 , because of tb , compared with less than 700 a decade ago .
but what , or who , is to blame ?
how is the problem tackled ?
later on tuesday the rural affairs minister , elin jones , will outline her response .
speak to most farmers and the answer is unequivocal .
the fault lies with badgers , killing them is the only answer .
yes , badgers may be native to the british countryside and have been around for thousands of years but , say farmers , they infect thousands of cattle with bovine tuberculosis , a potentially fatal respiratory illness which can ultimately be transmitted to humans .
john owen is a farm manager near llandeilo in carmarthenshire who happens to have a ' closed ' herd - one into which no cattle have been introduced in the last four years and which does not border another livestock farm .
yet he has just lost 150 dairy cattle to tb and although he will be compensated for the animals ' value , he will have to absorb thousands of pounds in lost income himself .
mr owen is a quietly spoken man and is not quick to blame badgers for something he says can not be definitely proven .
cattle can catch tuberculosis from other cattle and from badgers " it 's been devastating .
tb got into the herd somehow but no livestock was brought in and we test on a regular basis . "
mr owen would support a controlled cull of badgers within a limited , defined area as part of a wider strategy at tackling tb as would many vets who share the farming " perspective " .
that view , predictably and understandably , is not shared by groups who seek to protect badgers .
for more than 30 years gareth morgan has taken delight in watching and studying badgers at many setts in mid wales .
they are playful , intelligent creatures with a highly-developed social system .
gareth and other badger enthusiasts do not dispute they or other mammals can carry tb but say to blame and punish them for spreading the disease in cattle is simply wrong .
scientific evidence is inconclusive .
many reports back the farmers and the vets .
others , most notably a study carried out over 10 years by the independent scientific group -lrb- isg -rrb- suggest that a cull of badgers might not achieve a significant reduction of tb among cattle .
buoyed by the isg report , badger " huggers " as their detractors call them , say the real problem lies with modern , intensive farming .
thousands of animals , mechanically reared for optimum profit , living in close quarters spreading illness among each other .
foot and mouth , bluetongue and now tb .
proof enough say those hoping to save the badger .
those arguments certainly are not lost on the agriculture minister as she puts forward a comprehensive strategy today to deal with tb in wales .
this strategy is likely to include better and more rigorous testing of cattle .
the problem for ms jones is that any announcement to eradicate badgers within a defined area may go down well in the farming community but will be deeply unpopular among the general public .

scientists are concerned that if the virus evolves to pass easily from human to human millions could be at risk .
a genetic analysis of the chinese case published in the lancet found no evidence to suggest the virus had gained that ability .
but an expert has warned that failure to control outbreaks of disease in poultry is fuelling the risk to humans . "
there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic " professor ian jones university of reading writing in the lancet , dr jeremy farrar , of vietnam 's hospital for tropical diseases , said : " whatever the underlying determinants , if we continue to experience widespread , uncontrolled outbreaks of h5n1 in poultry , the appearance of strains well adapted to human beings might just be matter of time . "
however , he said a pandemic was by no means a " biological inevitability " .
so far 376 cases of human infection with the h5n1 form of bird flu have been recorded in 14 countries since november 2003 , mostly in south east asia .
there have been 238 recorded deaths from the virus , of which a quarter have come in clusters of two or more linked people .
at present h5n1 remains overwhelmingly a disease which affects birds , and the only humans at risk appear to be those with regular close contact with infected animals .
but the researchers , from the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , warn that clusters of h5n1 human infections require close scrutiny to determine whether the virus is starting to evolve into a more potent threat .
father survived the lancet study highlights the case of a 24-year-old man , from nanjing , in jiangsu province , who died from bird flu .
it is thought he passed the disease on to his 52-year-old father , who survived after receiving prompt medical attention , including anti-viral treatment , and plasma cells from somebody who had been vaccinated against the disease .
it is believed the son caught the disease during a visit to a poultry market six days before he became ill .
medics also tested 91 people who had come into contact with the infected men , but none of those had contracted h5n1 .
the researchers say the possibility that the father caught the disease independently can not be completely ruled out , but think it unlikely .
other cases of suspected human-to-human transmission have also been between blood relations .
this may be because related individuals share a genetic susceptibility to infection .
professor ian jones , an expert in virology at the university of reading , said the fact that the father was the only person to be infected was encouraging .
" the virus isolated had no changes to indicate adaptation to human infection , " he said .
" there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic . "

scientists are concerned that if the virus evolves to pass easily from human to human millions could be at risk .
a genetic analysis of the chinese case published in the lancet found no evidence to suggest the virus had gained that ability .
but an expert has warned that failure to control outbreaks of disease in poultry is fuelling the risk to humans .
there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic professor ian jones university of reading writing in the lancet , dr jeremy farrar , of vietnam 's hospital for tropical diseases , said : " whatever the underlying determinants , if we continue to experience widespread , uncontrolled outbreaks of h5n1 in poultry , the appearance of strains well adapted to human beings might just be matter of time . "
however , he said a pandemic was by no means a " biological inevitability " .
so far 376 cases of human infection with the h5n1 form of bird flu have been recorded in 14 countries since november 2003 , mostly in south east asia .
there have been 238 recorded deaths from the virus , of which a quarter have come in clusters of two or more linked people .
at present h5n1 remains overwhelmingly a disease which affects birds , and the only humans at risk appear to be those with regular close contact with infected animals .
but the researchers , from the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , warn that clusters of h5n1 human infections require close scrutiny to determine whether the virus is starting to evolve into a more potent threat .
father survived the lancet study highlights the case of a 24-year-old man , from nanjing , in jiangsu province , who died from bird flu .
it is thought he passed the disease on to his 52-year-old father , who survived after receiving prompt medical attention , including anti-viral treatment , and plasma cells from somebody who had been vaccinated against the disease .
it is believed the son caught the disease during a visit to a poultry market six days before he became ill .
medics also tested 91 people who had come into contact with the infected men , but none of those had contracted h5n1 .
the researchers say the possibility that the father caught the disease independently can not be completely ruled out , but think it unlikely .
other cases of suspected human-to-human transmission have also been between blood relations .
this may be because related individuals share a genetic susceptibility to infection .
professor ian jones , an expert in virology at the university of reading , said the fact that the father was the only person to be infected was encouraging .
" the virus isolated had no changes to indicate adaptation to human infection , " he said .
" there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic . "
professor wendy barclay , of imperial college london , agreed there was no evidence to support the idea that h5n1 had acquired mutations that make it more dangerous to humans .

there have been 238 recorded deaths from the virus , of which a quarter have come in clusters of two or more linked people .
at present h5n1 remains overwhelmingly a disease which affects birds , and the only humans at risk appear to be those with regular close contact with infected animals .
but the researchers , from the chinese centre for disease control and prevention , warn that clusters of h5n1 human infections require close scrutiny to determine whether the virus is starting to evolve into a more potent threat .
father survived the lancet study highlights the case of a 24-year-old man , from nanjing , in jiangsu province , who died from bird flu .
it is thought he passed the disease on to his 52-year-old father , who survived after receiving prompt medical attention , including anti-viral treatment , and plasma cells from somebody who had been vaccinated against the disease .
it is believed the son caught the disease during a visit to a poultry market six days before he became ill .
medics also tested 91 people who had come into contact with the infected men , but none of those had contracted h5n1 .
the researchers say the possibility that the father caught the disease independently can not be completely ruled out , but think it unlikely .
other cases of suspected human-to-human transmission have also been between blood relations .
this may be because related individuals share a genetic susceptibility to infection .
professor ian jones , an expert in virology at the university of reading , said the fact that the father was the only person to be infected was encouraging .
" the virus isolated had no changes to indicate adaptation to human infection , " he said .
" there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic . "
professor wendy barclay , of imperial college london , agreed there was no evidence to support the idea that h5n1 had acquired mutations that make it more dangerous to humans .
" the experience here reinforces the idea that there are still several barriers the virus must overcome before it acquires human transmissibility . "

scientists are concerned that if the virus evolves to pass easily from human to human millions could be at risk .
a genetic analysis of the chinese case published in the lancet found no evidence to suggest the virus had gained that ability .
but an expert has warned that failure to control outbreaks of disease in poultry is fuelling the risk to humans .
there is no indication from this data that we are any nearer a pandemic professor ian jones university of reading writing in the lancet , dr jeremy farrar , of vietnam 's hospital for tropical diseases , said : " whatever the underlying determinants , if we continue to experience widespread , uncontrolled outbreaks of h5n1 in poultry , the appearance of strains well adapted to human beings might just be matter of time .

the company that runs the tunnel between britain and france reported a net profit of 1m euros -lrb- $ 1.6m ; £ 795,000 -rrb- in the whole of 2007 .
that included a 3.3bn-euro exceptional profit from its capital restructuring .
the company has struggled with its debt levels since the tunnel was opened in 1994 , but it finally reached agreement with its creditors last year .
" the year 2007 proves that the new eurotunnel group has broken with its past , " the company said in a statement .
lost perks the 2007 agreement cut its debt levels from 9.2bn euros to 4.2bn euros .
the restructuring plan involved shareholders swapping their shares for shares in a new company called groupe eurotunnel , which saved the company from bankruptcy but meant they lost perks such as unlimited free travel .
the company said its sales had grown 15 % at constant exchange rates in the first three months of 2008 , making its boss optimistic about beating projections .
" the first quarter gives me a lot of confidence that we can beat our forecast for 2010 , " eurotunnel chief executive jacques gounon said .

bbc news technology correspondent rory cellan-jones put your questions to the firm 's leader .
q : the first question comes from bill currie , in hong kong .
he asks if we really need all the power in today 's computers ?
paul otellini : the pcs that we 're using today are 32 times more powerful than the ones we first started with .
i 've been in this industry long enough to remember when we first brought out the 286 , someone said , who needs all that processing power - what are you going to doing with it ?
and then a generation later , it was , i need a 386 , then i need 486 and a pentium .
i think the real simple answer is that the applications ; the things that we 're going to do on computers continue to need more and more performance - more and more compute power to be able to give us what we need .
and it 's not so much it will run your spreadsheet any faster , it 's that the web is going to become increasingly immersive , increasingly visual , increasingly graphics intensive - increasingly photo-realistic kinds of things for social networking .
the kinds of applications that you 'd like to have to that will make pcs easier to use also need more performance .
for example , speech - would n't it be great to be able to talk to the computer , have it understand you and have it do what you want , as opposed to typing or any other kind of interface .
that takes far more than 32 times more performance than you have today .
your questions for intel boss what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time q : now , cameron solnordal , in melbourne , australia takes that on a bit and says what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time , if moore 's law continues ?
will the devices themselves change radically ?
paul otellini : the cell phone will get smarter and smarter - i think everyone accepts that they 're going to become nothing more than a very portable computer - that requires more performance .
so i see the computers of tomorrow just taking everything that has electronics in it and allowing those machines to have internet access .
so your automobiles , industrial control , your phones , your home heating systems will all be connected to the web to allow you to either gather information from them , to run them more smartly , or to become just much more efficient .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement intel chief executive paul otellini answered user questions q : we 've got a question about the atom chip from lee setford , from portsmouth , hampshire : with increasing focus on the green aspect on computers , do you believe that atom competes with the latest super energy-efficient processors in terms of price and performance ?
what 's that going to do - what 's the importance of that ?
paul otellini : well atom is aimed at a whole new class of applications and new class of machines and it 's the first time we 've ever really done a product that 's power optimised for these new devices .
q : can we have a look at one ?
paul otellini : what we 've done here is we 've designed something that has very good performance ; it 's about as fast as the fastest laptop in the world was just a couple of years ago but very low power , so it saves energy , it goes into low-cost devices - it will also go into handheld devices .
your questions for intel boss should intel be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
q : let 's move on to the competitive field that you 're in .
neil dowdall from holland wonders whether the current situation in the market is healthy - intel is so far ahead of amd in terms of technology and price that one could say it 's a monopoly like microsoft .
should you , intel , be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so .
his observation is correct , his memory may be a little short though .
a couple of years ago we were being criticised for being behind them and one of the things i 've seen in this industry over three decades is that there 's a lot of giving and taking in terms of competitive lead and in the semi-conductor industry participants never take their position for granted - if you did you 'd be out of business .
q : another question on competition - new competition - john wayne , from llanharry , mid glamorgan : are you worried about sony 's cell chip challenging your dominance of the market ?
paul otellini : as they would say , it 's interesting architecture .
it 's a many-core architecture .
the problem that i see with that architecture is two-fold : the way it requires a whole new set of applications and it 's a very difficult architecture to program .
q : on the wider economic background , of course hard times in america at the moment .
gonzalo zavala from london asks : how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
your questions for intel boss how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
paul otellini : well , 75 % of our revenue is not in the us today .
q : the global economy is not looking that brilliant either is it ?
paul otellini : well , it 's not bad .
it may not grow as much as fast as people thought it would a year ago for 2008 but much of our sales in the last few years and much of our sales growth have been in emerging markets ; in china and india , south east asia , latin america , eastern europe , the middle east .
i do n't see those going into any kind of recession - at least i have n't seen any projections of that so far .
q : john riley from northampton in england asks : why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
do they have to keep going through that boring boot-up which takes ages ?
your questions for intel boss why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
paul otellini : i do n't suppose i could tell him to ask bill gates that question !
quite seriously - i do n't re-boot my machines anymore unless there 's a reason - a new application i want to load or something or an upgrade kind of thing .
my laptop turns on and off like a television - when i want to use it i open the lid and it is there - it wakes up - and i close it when i 'm finished .
that 's the way they should be and that 's the way they are today .
most people do n't need to re-boot their machines every week or indeed every hour .
q : neil moss , from edinburgh asks : why does my two gigahertz dual core pc take longer to open my email and word processor than my machine of 10 years ago , which ran at 1/200th of the speed ?
he again thinks modern software has slipped into , what he calls , a do less with more ethos .
paul otellini has been with intel for 34 years paul otellini : without knowing what he 's running on that machine , it 's pretty hard to diagnose it .
q : but do n't you think that is a common theme ?
paul otellini : no .
q : there is frustration amongst a lot of users that they are getting more and more powerful machines that do n't necessarily do things that much better than they did 10 years ago .
paul otellini : i disagree .
take what people do today - i do n't know if you have children , i do - my daughter spends all of her time with photographs , with videos and so forth .
you could n't even run those on a pc of five years ago .
you want to do some photo editing - try doing that on a five year-old machine versus a dual core machine .
q : now we 've got a couple of questions about wimax which of course is a technology which has promised much but not delivered a lot yet in terms of giving people access to broadband over a wide area .
they 're both from the developing world .
philippe thai from phnom penh in cambodia , and rawaz rauf from iraq .
they both really want to know what intel 's investment in wimax is going to mean for them - whether it 's going to bring big changes ?
paul otellini : we 're incorporating wimax into notebook starting this year .
it starts going into handheld devices , starting next year .
there are 120 deployments around the world today - it is starting to move as countries and cities are starting to get populated .
so i think you 'll sit here a year from now and you 'll have tens of millions of subscribers and you 'll move to hundreds of millions of subscribers say two years later than that - that 's pretty good .
q : femi alla from lagos , nigeria wonders why they have n't heard more about the classmate which is your rival to the one laptop per child project .
is it going to go any further than the couple of schools where she says the concept was demonstrated and which gave both projects a lot of media exposure ?
your questions for intel boss why have n't we heard more about the classmate pc ?
paul otellini : we are quite happy with where we are at ; we 're now in our second generation of the product - there are a lot of large contracts .
at the end of the day though , this is really focused on getting school districts affordable computing and that gets down to budgets and how fast people want to deploy them .
i 'm happy with where we are with the product .
q : nicolas negroponte who runs the one laptop per child project has been very harsh about intel 's attitude , claiming that you acted in bad faith and basically attempted to drive them out of countries like nigeria .
what do you say to that ?
paul otellini : i think i 've used this word with your network before - i think it is hogwash .
we did n't do anything that drove him out of anything .
we competed fairly for the business and it is a different computer model .
the two basic machines are approached , dealing with the problem of getting children laptops , differently .
ours is focused on working with teachers and having a teacher-driven education environment .
olpc is focused on , give the kids a laptop , turn them on to the internet and let them go .
we happen to think that the teaching model that works for teachers is a better model .
our laptop ships with teacher-control software ; so teachers can control what the kids are doing in class and be able to manage the process .
it 's a whole different thought process .
q : do you think their model will survive ?
can both models survive ?
paul otellini : i do n't see why not ; we 're having some success with ours and they 're having some success with theirs .
i think it gets down to what do the school districts want to do and when a school district chooses one versus the other , it does n't mean that the other one is wrong , it just means that they 've made a different choice in terms of the education profile they want to apply .
your questions for intel boss how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
q : moving on to one slightly quirky question here : chris barker , in otley , west yorkshire : how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
paul otellini : well i 'm quite fond of it .
so as long as i 'm around i think we 'll listen to it .
billions of people around the world have heard that bong and it identifies commercials with the company that is providing the technology inside it and i think it 's a very effective campaign .
q : a couple of personal questions : ibrahim faisal from the maldives wants to know about your personal technology .
what kind of laptop do you carry ?
paul otellini : it depends on what i 'm doing .
i 've got a centrino pro machine that i carry around with me for business and i 've got a mac i use for my photos at home .
q : are you equally comfortable with both ?
you must have a difficult line to tread on the mac versus pc battle these days .
paul otellini : not really .
both sides are customers so we 're quite happy with that and actually i 've enjoyed learning how to use a mac , it 's something i never did in the first part of my career and it 's nice seeing what both sides can do because i do different things with different machines .
q : so it 's a mac at home , pc at work kind of split is it ?
paul otellini : yes because our corporate environment is all pc-based and the technology we 've embedded into centrino pro , includes security and manageability features that i think are very important for enterprises like intel .
q : what about your email ?
how in touch are you ?
paul otellini : oh , i 'm 24/7 .
q : is it blackberry ?
is it on your phone ?
paul otellini : i 've a blackberry .
most of it i do on my laptop because the blackberry is nice when you 're walking down the hall or something but given the amount of email i have , i need a pretty good keyboard to be able to keep up with it .
q : do you ever feel that you 'd like to be disconnected from the internet for 24 hours ?
paul otellini : no .
i am not one of those people .
it 's pretty hard for me to disconnect from my job for 24 hours let alone the emails .
emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .
if i go away for the weekends sometimes , i may turn it off - but not too often .
q : you 're an addict , would you say ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so - maybe all addicts say no but i do n't think so because it 's my choice at the end of the day .
q : finally , wes ramsay from tennessee in the united states wants you to look to the future and say one day you 'll retire , what professional accomplishment will you look back on with the greatest sense of satisfaction and what about a personal accomplishment ?
paul otellini : i 'm not done with my career yet , so it 's hard to project what you 're going to be most proud of .
but to date , i think i 'm happiest with the fact that i 've been at a company for 34 years now that has changed the world inside the timeframe of my career and i 've had something to do with that .
it 's not often that corporations can say , with legitimacy , i changed the world because of what i do the world 's a better and different place .

your questions for intel boss what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time q : now , cameron solnordal , in melbourne , australia takes that on a bit and says what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time , if moore 's law continues ?
will the devices themselves change radically ?
paul otellini : the cell phone will get smarter and smarter - i think everyone accepts that they 're going to become nothing more than a very portable computer - that requires more performance .
so i see the computers of tomorrow just taking everything that has electronics in it and allowing those machines to have internet access .
so your automobiles , industrial control , your phones , your home heating systems will all be connected to the web to allow you to either gather information from them , to run them more smartly , or to become just much more efficient .

advertisement intel chief executive paul otellini answered user questions q : we 've got a question about the atom chip from lee setford , from portsmouth , hampshire : with increasing focus on the green aspect on computers , do you believe that atom competes with the latest super energy-efficient processors in terms of price and performance ?
what 's that going to do - what 's the importance of that ?
paul otellini : well atom is aimed at a whole new class of applications and new class of machines and it 's the first time we 've ever really done a product that 's power optimised for these new devices .
q : can we have a look at one ?
paul otellini : what we 've done here is we 've designed something that has very good performance ; it 's about as fast as the fastest laptop in the world was just a couple of years ago but very low power , so it saves energy , it goes into low-cost devices - it will also go into handheld devices .
your questions for intel boss should intel be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
q : let 's move on to the competitive field that you 're in .
neil dowdall from holland wonders whether the current situation in the market is healthy - intel is so far ahead of amd in terms of technology and price that one could say it 's a monopoly like microsoft .
should you , intel , be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so .
his observation is correct , his memory may be a little short though .
a couple of years ago we were being criticised for being behind them and one of the things i 've seen in this industry over three decades is that there 's a lot of giving and taking in terms of competitive lead and in the semi-conductor industry participants never take their position for granted - if you did you 'd be out of business .
q : another question on competition - new competition - john wayne , from llanharry , mid glamorgan : are you worried about sony 's cell chip challenging your dominance of the market ?
paul otellini : as they would say , it 's interesting architecture .
it 's a many-core architecture .
the problem that i see with that architecture is two-fold : the way it requires a whole new set of applications and it 's a very difficult architecture to program .
q : on the wider economic background , of course hard times in america at the moment .
gonzalo zavala from london asks : how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
your questions for intel boss how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
paul otellini : well , 75 % of our revenue is not in the us today .
q : the global economy is not looking that brilliant either is it ?
paul otellini : well , it 's not bad .
it may not grow as much as fast as people thought it would a year ago for 2008 but much of our sales in the last few years and much of our sales growth have been in emerging markets ; in china and india , south east asia , latin america , eastern europe , the middle east .
i do n't see those going into any kind of recession - at least i have n't seen any projections of that so far .
q : john riley from northampton in england asks : why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
do they have to keep going through that boring boot-up which takes ages ?
your questions for intel boss why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
paul otellini : i do n't suppose i could tell him to ask bill gates that question !
quite seriously - i do n't re-boot my machines anymore unless there 's a reason - a new application i want to load or something or an upgrade kind of thing .
my laptop turns on and off like a television - when i want to use it i open the lid and it is there - it wakes up - and i close it when i 'm finished .
that 's the way they should be and that 's the way they are today .
most people do n't need to re-boot their machines every week or indeed every hour .
q : neil moss , from edinburgh asks : why does my two gigahertz dual core pc take longer to open my email and word processor than my machine of 10 years ago , which ran at 1/200th of the speed ?
he again thinks modern software has slipped into , what he calls , a do less with more ethos .
paul otellini has been with intel for 34 years paul otellini : without knowing what he 's running on that machine , it 's pretty hard to diagnose it .
q : but do n't you think that is a common theme ?
paul otellini : no .
q : there is frustration amongst a lot of users that they are getting more and more powerful machines that do n't necessarily do things that much better than they did 10 years ago .
paul otellini : i disagree .
take what people do today - i do n't know if you have children , i do - my daughter spends all of her time with photographs , with videos and so forth .
you could n't even run those on a pc of five years ago .
you want to do some photo editing - try doing that on a five year-old machine versus a dual core machine .
q : now we 've got a couple of questions about wimax which of course is a technology which has promised much but not delivered a lot yet in terms of giving people access to broadband over a wide area .
they 're both from the developing world .
philippe thai from phnom penh in cambodia , and rawaz rauf from iraq .
they both really want to know what intel 's investment in wimax is going to mean for them - whether it 's going to bring big changes ?
paul otellini : we 're incorporating wimax into notebook starting this year .
it starts going into handheld devices , starting next year .
there are 120 deployments around the world today - it is starting to move as countries and cities are starting to get populated .
so i think you 'll sit here a year from now and you 'll have tens of millions of subscribers and you 'll move to hundreds of millions of subscribers say two years later than that - that 's pretty good .
q : femi alla from lagos , nigeria wonders why they have n't heard more about the classmate which is your rival to the one laptop per child project .
is it going to go any further than the couple of schools where she says the concept was demonstrated and which gave both projects a lot of media exposure ?
your questions for intel boss why have n't we heard more about the classmate pc ?
paul otellini : we are quite happy with where we are at ; we 're now in our second generation of the product - there are a lot of large contracts .
at the end of the day though , this is really focused on getting school districts affordable computing and that gets down to budgets and how fast people want to deploy them .
i 'm happy with where we are with the product .
q : nicolas negroponte who runs the one laptop per child project has been very harsh about intel 's attitude , claiming that you acted in bad faith and basically attempted to drive them out of countries like nigeria .
what do you say to that ?
paul otellini : i think i 've used this word with your network before - i think it is hogwash .
we did n't do anything that drove him out of anything .
we competed fairly for the business and it is a different computer model .
the two basic machines are approached , dealing with the problem of getting children laptops , differently .
ours is focused on working with teachers and having a teacher-driven education environment .
olpc is focused on , give the kids a laptop , turn them on to the internet and let them go .
we happen to think that the teaching model that works for teachers is a better model .
our laptop ships with teacher-control software ; so teachers can control what the kids are doing in class and be able to manage the process .
it 's a whole different thought process .
q : do you think their model will survive ?
can both models survive ?
paul otellini : i do n't see why not ; we 're having some success with ours and they 're having some success with theirs .
i think it gets down to what do the school districts want to do and when a school district chooses one versus the other , it does n't mean that the other one is wrong , it just means that they 've made a different choice in terms of the education profile they want to apply .
your questions for intel boss how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
q : moving on to one slightly quirky question here : chris barker , in otley , west yorkshire : how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
paul otellini : well i 'm quite fond of it .
so as long as i 'm around i think we 'll listen to it .
billions of people around the world have heard that bong and it identifies commercials with the company that is providing the technology inside it and i think it 's a very effective campaign .
q : a couple of personal questions : ibrahim faisal from the maldives wants to know about your personal technology .
what kind of laptop do you carry ?
paul otellini : it depends on what i 'm doing .
i 've got a centrino pro machine that i carry around with me for business and i 've got a mac i use for my photos at home .
q : are you equally comfortable with both ?
you must have a difficult line to tread on the mac versus pc battle these days .
paul otellini : not really .
both sides are customers so we 're quite happy with that and actually i 've enjoyed learning how to use a mac , it 's something i never did in the first part of my career and it 's nice seeing what both sides can do because i do different things with different machines .
q : so it 's a mac at home , pc at work kind of split is it ?
paul otellini : yes because our corporate environment is all pc-based and the technology we 've embedded into centrino pro , includes security and manageability features that i think are very important for enterprises like intel .
q : what about your email ?
how in touch are you ?
paul otellini : oh , i 'm 24/7 .
q : is it blackberry ?
is it on your phone ?
paul otellini : i 've a blackberry .
most of it i do on my laptop because the blackberry is nice when you 're walking down the hall or something but given the amount of email i have , i need a pretty good keyboard to be able to keep up with it .
q : do you ever feel that you 'd like to be disconnected from the internet for 24 hours ?
paul otellini : no .
i am not one of those people .
it 's pretty hard for me to disconnect from my job for 24 hours let alone the emails .
emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .
if i go away for the weekends sometimes , i may turn it off - but not too often .
q : you 're an addict , would you say ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so - maybe all addicts say no but i do n't think so because it 's my choice at the end of the day .
q : finally , wes ramsay from tennessee in the united states wants you to look to the future and say one day you 'll retire , what professional accomplishment will you look back on with the greatest sense of satisfaction and what about a personal accomplishment ?
paul otellini : i 'm not done with my career yet , so it 's hard to project what you 're going to be most proud of .
but to date , i think i 'm happiest with the fact that i 've been at a company for 34 years now that has changed the world inside the timeframe of my career and i 've had something to do with that .
it 's not often that corporations can say , with legitimacy , i changed the world because of what i do the world 's a better and different place .

bbc news technology correspondent rory cellan-jones put your questions to the firm 's leader .
q : the first question comes from bill currie , in hong kong .
he asks if we really need all the power in today 's computers ?
paul otellini : the pcs that we 're using today are 32 times more powerful than the ones we first started with .
i 've been in this industry long enough to remember when we first brought out the 286 , someone said , who needs all that processing power - what are you going to doing with it ?
and then a generation later , it was , i need a 386 , then i need 486 and a pentium .
i think the real simple answer is that the applications ; the things that we 're going to do on computers continue to need more and more performance - more and more compute power to be able to give us what we need .
and it 's not so much it will run your spreadsheet any faster , it 's that the web is going to become increasingly immersive , increasingly visual , increasingly graphics intensive - increasingly photo-realistic kinds of things for social networking .
the kinds of applications that you 'd like to have to that will make pcs easier to use also need more performance .
for example , speech - would n't it be great to be able to talk to the computer , have it understand you and have it do what you want , as opposed to typing or any other kind of interface .
that takes far more than 32 times more performance than you have today .
your questions for intel boss what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time q : now , cameron solnordal , in melbourne , australia takes that on a bit and says what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time , if moore 's law continues ?

q : the first question comes from bill currie , in hong kong .
he asks if we really need all the power in today 's computers ?
paul otellini : the pcs that we 're using today are 32 times more powerful than the ones we first started with .
i 've been in this industry long enough to remember when we first brought out the 286 , someone said , who needs all that processing power - what are you going to doing with it ?
and then a generation later , it was , i need a 386 , then i need 486 and a pentium .
i think the real simple answer is that the applications ; the things that we 're going to do on computers continue to need more and more performance - more and more compute power to be able to give us what we need .
and it 's not so much it will run your spreadsheet any faster , it 's that the web is going to become increasingly immersive , increasingly visual , increasingly graphics intensive - increasingly photo-realistic kinds of things for social networking .
the kinds of applications that you 'd like to have to that will make pcs easier to use also need more performance .
for example , speech - would n't it be great to be able to talk to the computer , have it understand you and have it do what you want , as opposed to typing or any other kind of interface .
that takes far more than 32 times more performance than you have today .
your questions for intel boss what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time q : now , cameron solnordal , in melbourne , australia takes that on a bit and says what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time , if moore 's law continues ?
will the devices themselves change radically ?
paul otellini : the cell phone will get smarter and smarter - i think everyone accepts that they 're going to become nothing more than a very portable computer - that requires more performance .
so i see the computers of tomorrow just taking everything that has electronics in it and allowing those machines to have internet access .
so your automobiles , industrial control , your phones , your home heating systems will all be connected to the web to allow you to either gather information from them , to run them more smartly , or to become just much more efficient .

advertisement intel chief executive paul otellini answered user questions q : we 've got a question about the atom chip from lee setford , from portsmouth , hampshire : with increasing focus on the green aspect on computers , do you believe that atom competes with the latest super energy-efficient processors in terms of price and performance ?
what 's that going to do - what 's the importance of that ?
paul otellini : well atom is aimed at a whole new class of applications and new class of machines and it 's the first time we 've ever really done a product that 's power optimised for these new devices .
q : can we have a look at one ?
paul otellini : what we 've done here is we 've designed something that has very good performance ; it 's about as fast as the fastest laptop in the world was just a couple of years ago but very low power , so it saves energy , it goes into low-cost devices - it will also go into handheld devices .
your questions for intel boss should intel be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
q : let 's move on to the competitive field that you 're in .
neil dowdall from holland wonders whether the current situation in the market is healthy - intel is so far ahead of amd in terms of technology and price that one could say it 's a monopoly like microsoft .
should you , intel , be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so .
his observation is correct , his memory may be a little short though .
a couple of years ago we were being criticised for being behind them and one of the things i 've seen in this industry over three decades is that there 's a lot of giving and taking in terms of competitive lead and in the semi-conductor industry participants never take their position for granted - if you did you 'd be out of business .
q : another question on competition - new competition - john wayne , from llanharry , mid glamorgan : are you worried about sony 's cell chip challenging your dominance of the market ?
paul otellini : as they would say , it 's interesting architecture .
it 's a many-core architecture .
the problem that i see with that architecture is two-fold : the way it requires a whole new set of applications and it 's a very difficult architecture to program .
q : on the wider economic background , of course hard times in america at the moment .
gonzalo zavala from london asks : how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
your questions for intel boss how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
paul otellini : well , 75 % of our revenue is not in the us today .
q : the global economy is not looking that brilliant either is it ?
paul otellini : well , it 's not bad .
it may not grow as much as fast as people thought it would a year ago for 2008 but much of our sales in the last few years and much of our sales growth have been in emerging markets ; in china and india , south east asia , latin america , eastern europe , the middle east .
i do n't see those going into any kind of recession - at least i have n't seen any projections of that so far .
q : john riley from northampton in england asks : why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
do they have to keep going through that boring boot-up which takes ages ?
your questions for intel boss why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
paul otellini : i do n't suppose i could tell him to ask bill gates that question !
quite seriously - i do n't re-boot my machines anymore unless there 's a reason - a new application i want to load or something or an upgrade kind of thing .
my laptop turns on and off like a television - when i want to use it i open the lid and it is there - it wakes up - and i close it when i 'm finished .
that 's the way they should be and that 's the way they are today .
most people do n't need to re-boot their machines every week or indeed every hour .
q : neil moss , from edinburgh asks : why does my two gigahertz dual core pc take longer to open my email and word processor than my machine of 10 years ago , which ran at 1/200th of the speed ?
he again thinks modern software has slipped into , what he calls , a do less with more ethos .
paul otellini has been with intel for 34 years paul otellini : without knowing what he 's running on that machine , it 's pretty hard to diagnose it .
q : but do n't you think that is a common theme ?
paul otellini : no .
q : there is frustration amongst a lot of users that they are getting more and more powerful machines that do n't necessarily do things that much better than they did 10 years ago .
paul otellini : i disagree .
take what people do today - i do n't know if you have children , i do - my daughter spends all of her time with photographs , with videos and so forth .
you could n't even run those on a pc of five years ago .
you want to do some photo editing - try doing that on a five year-old machine versus a dual core machine .
q : now we 've got a couple of questions about wimax which of course is a technology which has promised much but not delivered a lot yet in terms of giving people access to broadband over a wide area .
they 're both from the developing world .
philippe thai from phnom penh in cambodia , and rawaz rauf from iraq .
they both really want to know what intel 's investment in wimax is going to mean for them - whether it 's going to bring big changes ?
paul otellini : we 're incorporating wimax into notebook starting this year .
it starts going into handheld devices , starting next year .
there are 120 deployments around the world today - it is starting to move as countries and cities are starting to get populated .
so i think you 'll sit here a year from now and you 'll have tens of millions of subscribers and you 'll move to hundreds of millions of subscribers say two years later than that - that 's pretty good .
q : femi alla from lagos , nigeria wonders why they have n't heard more about the classmate which is your rival to the one laptop per child project .
is it going to go any further than the couple of schools where she says the concept was demonstrated and which gave both projects a lot of media exposure ?
your questions for intel boss why have n't we heard more about the classmate pc ?
paul otellini : we are quite happy with where we are at ; we 're now in our second generation of the product - there are a lot of large contracts .
at the end of the day though , this is really focused on getting school districts affordable computing and that gets down to budgets and how fast people want to deploy them .
i 'm happy with where we are with the product .
q : nicolas negroponte who runs the one laptop per child project has been very harsh about intel 's attitude , claiming that you acted in bad faith and basically attempted to drive them out of countries like nigeria .
what do you say to that ?
paul otellini : i think i 've used this word with your network before - i think it is hogwash .
we did n't do anything that drove him out of anything .
we competed fairly for the business and it is a different computer model .
the two basic machines are approached , dealing with the problem of getting children laptops , differently .
ours is focused on working with teachers and having a teacher-driven education environment .
olpc is focused on , give the kids a laptop , turn them on to the internet and let them go .
we happen to think that the teaching model that works for teachers is a better model .
our laptop ships with teacher-control software ; so teachers can control what the kids are doing in class and be able to manage the process .
it 's a whole different thought process .
q : do you think their model will survive ?
can both models survive ?
paul otellini : i do n't see why not ; we 're having some success with ours and they 're having some success with theirs .
i think it gets down to what do the school districts want to do and when a school district chooses one versus the other , it does n't mean that the other one is wrong , it just means that they 've made a different choice in terms of the education profile they want to apply .
your questions for intel boss how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
q : moving on to one slightly quirky question here : chris barker , in otley , west yorkshire : how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
paul otellini : well i 'm quite fond of it .
so as long as i 'm around i think we 'll listen to it .
billions of people around the world have heard that bong and it identifies commercials with the company that is providing the technology inside it and i think it 's a very effective campaign .
q : a couple of personal questions : ibrahim faisal from the maldives wants to know about your personal technology .
what kind of laptop do you carry ?
paul otellini : it depends on what i 'm doing .
i 've got a centrino pro machine that i carry around with me for business and i 've got a mac i use for my photos at home .
q : are you equally comfortable with both ?
you must have a difficult line to tread on the mac versus pc battle these days .
paul otellini : not really .
both sides are customers so we 're quite happy with that and actually i 've enjoyed learning how to use a mac , it 's something i never did in the first part of my career and it 's nice seeing what both sides can do because i do different things with different machines .
q : so it 's a mac at home , pc at work kind of split is it ?
paul otellini : yes because our corporate environment is all pc-based and the technology we 've embedded into centrino pro , includes security and manageability features that i think are very important for enterprises like intel .
q : what about your email ?
how in touch are you ?
paul otellini : oh , i 'm 24/7 .
q : is it blackberry ?
is it on your phone ?
paul otellini : i 've a blackberry .
most of it i do on my laptop because the blackberry is nice when you 're walking down the hall or something but given the amount of email i have , i need a pretty good keyboard to be able to keep up with it .
q : do you ever feel that you 'd like to be disconnected from the internet for 24 hours ?
paul otellini : no .
i am not one of those people .
it 's pretty hard for me to disconnect from my job for 24 hours let alone the emails .
emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .
if i go away for the weekends sometimes , i may turn it off - but not too often .
q : you 're an addict , would you say ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so - maybe all addicts say no but i do n't think so because it 's my choice at the end of the day .
q : finally , wes ramsay from tennessee in the united states wants you to look to the future and say one day you 'll retire , what professional accomplishment will you look back on with the greatest sense of satisfaction and what about a personal accomplishment ?
paul otellini : i 'm not done with my career yet , so it 's hard to project what you 're going to be most proud of .
but to date , i think i 'm happiest with the fact that i 've been at a company for 34 years now that has changed the world inside the timeframe of my career and i 've had something to do with that .
it 's not often that corporations can say , with legitimacy , i changed the world because of what i do the world 's a better and different place .

bbc news technology correspondent rory cellan-jones put your questions to the firm 's leader .
q : the first question comes from bill currie , in hong kong .
he asks if we really need all the power in today 's computers ?
paul otellini : the pcs that we 're using today are 32 times more powerful than the ones we first started with .
i 've been in this industry long enough to remember when we first brought out the 286 , someone said , who needs all that processing power - what are you going to doing with it ?
and then a generation later , it was , i need a 386 , then i need 486 and a pentium .
i think the real simple answer is that the applications ; the things that we 're going to do on computers continue to need more and more performance - more and more compute power to be able to give us what we need .
and it 's not so much it will run your spreadsheet any faster , it 's that the web is going to become increasingly immersive , increasingly visual , increasingly graphics intensive - increasingly photo-realistic kinds of things for social networking .
the kinds of applications that you 'd like to have to that will make pcs easier to use also need more performance .
for example , speech - would n't it be great to be able to talk to the computer , have it understand you and have it do what you want , as opposed to typing or any other kind of interface .
that takes far more than 32 times more performance than you have today .
your questions for intel boss what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time q : now , cameron solnordal , in melbourne , australia takes that on a bit and says what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time , if moore 's law continues ?
will the devices themselves change radically ?
paul otellini : the cell phone will get smarter and smarter - i think everyone accepts that they 're going to become nothing more than a very portable computer - that requires more performance .
so i see the computers of tomorrow just taking everything that has electronics in it and allowing those machines to have internet access .
so your automobiles , industrial control , your phones , your home heating systems will all be connected to the web to allow you to either gather information from them , to run them more smartly , or to become just much more efficient .

advertisement intel chief executive paul otellini answered user questions q : we 've got a question about the atom chip from lee setford , from portsmouth , hampshire : with increasing focus on the green aspect on computers , do you believe that atom competes with the latest super energy-efficient processors in terms of price and performance ?
what 's that going to do - what 's the importance of that ?
paul otellini : well atom is aimed at a whole new class of applications and new class of machines and it 's the first time we 've ever really done a product that 's power optimised for these new devices .
q : can we have a look at one ?
paul otellini : what we 've done here is we 've designed something that has very good performance ; it 's about as fast as the fastest laptop in the world was just a couple of years ago but very low power , so it saves energy , it goes into low-cost devices - it will also go into handheld devices .
your questions for intel boss should intel be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
q : let 's move on to the competitive field that you 're in .
neil dowdall from holland wonders whether the current situation in the market is healthy - intel is so far ahead of amd in terms of technology and price that one could say it 's a monopoly like microsoft .
should you , intel , be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so .
his observation is correct , his memory may be a little short though .
a couple of years ago we were being criticised for being behind them and one of the things i 've seen in this industry over three decades is that there 's a lot of giving and taking in terms of competitive lead and in the semi-conductor industry participants never take their position for granted - if you did you 'd be out of business .
q : another question on competition - new competition - john wayne , from llanharry , mid glamorgan : are you worried about sony 's cell chip challenging your dominance of the market ?
paul otellini : as they would say , it 's interesting architecture .
it 's a many-core architecture .
the problem that i see with that architecture is two-fold : the way it requires a whole new set of applications and it 's a very difficult architecture to program .
q : on the wider economic background , of course hard times in america at the moment .
gonzalo zavala from london asks : how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
your questions for intel boss how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
paul otellini : well , 75 % of our revenue is not in the us today .
q : the global economy is not looking that brilliant either is it ?
paul otellini : well , it 's not bad .
it may not grow as much as fast as people thought it would a year ago for 2008 but much of our sales in the last few years and much of our sales growth have been in emerging markets ; in china and india , south east asia , latin america , eastern europe , the middle east .
i do n't see those going into any kind of recession - at least i have n't seen any projections of that so far .
q : john riley from northampton in england asks : why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
do they have to keep going through that boring boot-up which takes ages ?
your questions for intel boss why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
paul otellini : i do n't suppose i could tell him to ask bill gates that question !
quite seriously - i do n't re-boot my machines anymore unless there 's a reason - a new application i want to load or something or an upgrade kind of thing .
my laptop turns on and off like a television - when i want to use it i open the lid and it is there - it wakes up - and i close it when i 'm finished .
that 's the way they should be and that 's the way they are today .
most people do n't need to re-boot their machines every week or indeed every hour .
q : neil moss , from edinburgh asks : why does my two gigahertz dual core pc take longer to open my email and word processor than my machine of 10 years ago , which ran at 1/200th of the speed ?
he again thinks modern software has slipped into , what he calls , a do less with more ethos .
paul otellini has been with intel for 34 years paul otellini : without knowing what he 's running on that machine , it 's pretty hard to diagnose it .
q : but do n't you think that is a common theme ?
paul otellini : no .
q : there is frustration amongst a lot of users that they are getting more and more powerful machines that do n't necessarily do things that much better than they did 10 years ago .
paul otellini : i disagree .
take what people do today - i do n't know if you have children , i do - my daughter spends all of her time with photographs , with videos and so forth .
you could n't even run those on a pc of five years ago .
you want to do some photo editing - try doing that on a five year-old machine versus a dual core machine .
q : now we 've got a couple of questions about wimax which of course is a technology which has promised much but not delivered a lot yet in terms of giving people access to broadband over a wide area .
they 're both from the developing world .
philippe thai from phnom penh in cambodia , and rawaz rauf from iraq .
they both really want to know what intel 's investment in wimax is going to mean for them - whether it 's going to bring big changes ?
paul otellini : we 're incorporating wimax into notebook starting this year .
it starts going into handheld devices , starting next year .
there are 120 deployments around the world today - it is starting to move as countries and cities are starting to get populated .
so i think you 'll sit here a year from now and you 'll have tens of millions of subscribers and you 'll move to hundreds of millions of subscribers say two years later than that - that 's pretty good .
q : femi alla from lagos , nigeria wonders why they have n't heard more about the classmate which is your rival to the one laptop per child project .
is it going to go any further than the couple of schools where she says the concept was demonstrated and which gave both projects a lot of media exposure ?
your questions for intel boss why have n't we heard more about the classmate pc ?
paul otellini : we are quite happy with where we are at ; we 're now in our second generation of the product - there are a lot of large contracts .
at the end of the day though , this is really focused on getting school districts affordable computing and that gets down to budgets and how fast people want to deploy them .
i 'm happy with where we are with the product .
q : nicolas negroponte who runs the one laptop per child project has been very harsh about intel 's attitude , claiming that you acted in bad faith and basically attempted to drive them out of countries like nigeria .
what do you say to that ?
paul otellini : i think i 've used this word with your network before - i think it is hogwash .
we did n't do anything that drove him out of anything .
we competed fairly for the business and it is a different computer model .
the two basic machines are approached , dealing with the problem of getting children laptops , differently .
ours is focused on working with teachers and having a teacher-driven education environment .
olpc is focused on , give the kids a laptop , turn them on to the internet and let them go .
we happen to think that the teaching model that works for teachers is a better model .
our laptop ships with teacher-control software ; so teachers can control what the kids are doing in class and be able to manage the process .
it 's a whole different thought process .
q : do you think their model will survive ?
can both models survive ?
paul otellini : i do n't see why not ; we 're having some success with ours and they 're having some success with theirs .
i think it gets down to what do the school districts want to do and when a school district chooses one versus the other , it does n't mean that the other one is wrong , it just means that they 've made a different choice in terms of the education profile they want to apply .
your questions for intel boss how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
q : moving on to one slightly quirky question here : chris barker , in otley , west yorkshire : how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
paul otellini : well i 'm quite fond of it .
so as long as i 'm around i think we 'll listen to it .
billions of people around the world have heard that bong and it identifies commercials with the company that is providing the technology inside it and i think it 's a very effective campaign .
q : a couple of personal questions : ibrahim faisal from the maldives wants to know about your personal technology .
what kind of laptop do you carry ?
paul otellini : it depends on what i 'm doing .
i 've got a centrino pro machine that i carry around with me for business and i 've got a mac i use for my photos at home .
q : are you equally comfortable with both ?
you must have a difficult line to tread on the mac versus pc battle these days .
paul otellini : not really .
both sides are customers so we 're quite happy with that and actually i 've enjoyed learning how to use a mac , it 's something i never did in the first part of my career and it 's nice seeing what both sides can do because i do different things with different machines .
q : so it 's a mac at home , pc at work kind of split is it ?
paul otellini : yes because our corporate environment is all pc-based and the technology we 've embedded into centrino pro , includes security and manageability features that i think are very important for enterprises like intel .
q : what about your email ?
how in touch are you ?
paul otellini : oh , i 'm 24/7 .
q : is it blackberry ?
is it on your phone ?
paul otellini : i 've a blackberry .
most of it i do on my laptop because the blackberry is nice when you 're walking down the hall or something but given the amount of email i have , i need a pretty good keyboard to be able to keep up with it .
q : do you ever feel that you 'd like to be disconnected from the internet for 24 hours ?
paul otellini : no .
i am not one of those people .
it 's pretty hard for me to disconnect from my job for 24 hours let alone the emails .
emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .
if i go away for the weekends sometimes , i may turn it off - but not too often .
q : you 're an addict , would you say ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so - maybe all addicts say no but i do n't think so because it 's my choice at the end of the day .
q : finally , wes ramsay from tennessee in the united states wants you to look to the future and say one day you 'll retire , what professional accomplishment will you look back on with the greatest sense of satisfaction and what about a personal accomplishment ?
paul otellini : i 'm not done with my career yet , so it 's hard to project what you 're going to be most proud of .
but to date , i think i 'm happiest with the fact that i 've been at a company for 34 years now that has changed the world inside the timeframe of my career and i 've had something to do with that .
it 's not often that corporations can say , with legitimacy , i changed the world because of what i do the world 's a better and different place .

emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .

bbc news technology correspondent rory cellan-jones put your questions to the firm 's leader .
q : the first question comes from bill currie , in hong kong .
he asks if we really need all the power in today 's computers ?
paul otellini : the pcs that we 're using today are 32 times more powerful than the ones we first started with .
i 've been in this industry long enough to remember when we first brought out the 286 , someone said , who needs all that processing power - what are you going to doing with it ?
and then a generation later , it was , i need a 386 , then i need 486 and a pentium .
i think the real simple answer is that the applications ; the things that we 're going to do on computers continue to need more and more performance - more and more compute power to be able to give us what we need .
and it 's not so much it will run your spreadsheet any faster , it 's that the web is going to become increasingly immersive , increasingly visual , increasingly graphics intensive - increasingly photo-realistic kinds of things for social networking .
the kinds of applications that you 'd like to have to that will make pcs easier to use also need more performance .
for example , speech - would n't it be great to be able to talk to the computer , have it understand you and have it do what you want , as opposed to typing or any other kind of interface .
that takes far more than 32 times more performance than you have today .
your questions for intel boss what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time q : now , cameron solnordal , in melbourne , australia takes that on a bit and says what kind of computers do you envisage being used in 10 to 20 years time , if moore 's law continues ?
will the devices themselves change radically ?
paul otellini : the cell phone will get smarter and smarter - i think everyone accepts that they 're going to become nothing more than a very portable computer - that requires more performance .
so i see the computers of tomorrow just taking everything that has electronics in it and allowing those machines to have internet access .
so your automobiles , industrial control , your phones , your home heating systems will all be connected to the web to allow you to either gather information from them , to run them more smartly , or to become just much more efficient .

advertisement intel chief executive paul otellini answered user questions q : we 've got a question about the atom chip from lee setford , from portsmouth , hampshire : with increasing focus on the green aspect on computers , do you believe that atom competes with the latest super energy-efficient processors in terms of price and performance ?
what 's that going to do - what 's the importance of that ?
paul otellini : well atom is aimed at a whole new class of applications and new class of machines and it 's the first time we 've ever really done a product that 's power optimised for these new devices .
q : can we have a look at one ?
paul otellini : what we 've done here is we 've designed something that has very good performance ; it 's about as fast as the fastest laptop in the world was just a couple of years ago but very low power , so it saves energy , it goes into low-cost devices - it will also go into handheld devices .
your questions for intel boss should intel be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
q : let 's move on to the competitive field that you 're in .
neil dowdall from holland wonders whether the current situation in the market is healthy - intel is so far ahead of amd in terms of technology and price that one could say it 's a monopoly like microsoft .
should you , intel , be forced to share knowledge with amd ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so .
his observation is correct , his memory may be a little short though .
a couple of years ago we were being criticised for being behind them and one of the things i 've seen in this industry over three decades is that there 's a lot of giving and taking in terms of competitive lead and in the semi-conductor industry participants never take their position for granted - if you did you 'd be out of business .
q : another question on competition - new competition - john wayne , from llanharry , mid glamorgan : are you worried about sony 's cell chip challenging your dominance of the market ?
paul otellini : as they would say , it 's interesting architecture .
it 's a many-core architecture .
the problem that i see with that architecture is two-fold : the way it requires a whole new set of applications and it 's a very difficult architecture to program .
q : on the wider economic background , of course hard times in america at the moment .
gonzalo zavala from london asks : how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
your questions for intel boss how do you expect intel will be affected by a recession in america ?
paul otellini : well , 75 % of our revenue is not in the us today .
q : the global economy is not looking that brilliant either is it ?
paul otellini : well , it 's not bad .
it may not grow as much as fast as people thought it would a year ago for 2008 but much of our sales in the last few years and much of our sales growth have been in emerging markets ; in china and india , south east asia , latin america , eastern europe , the middle east .
i do n't see those going into any kind of recession - at least i have n't seen any projections of that so far .
q : john riley from northampton in england asks : why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
do they have to keep going through that boring boot-up which takes ages ?
your questions for intel boss why ca n't pcs turn off and on , just like a television does ?
paul otellini : i do n't suppose i could tell him to ask bill gates that question !
quite seriously - i do n't re-boot my machines anymore unless there 's a reason - a new application i want to load or something or an upgrade kind of thing .
my laptop turns on and off like a television - when i want to use it i open the lid and it is there - it wakes up - and i close it when i 'm finished .
that 's the way they should be and that 's the way they are today .
most people do n't need to re-boot their machines every week or indeed every hour .
q : neil moss , from edinburgh asks : why does my two gigahertz dual core pc take longer to open my email and word processor than my machine of 10 years ago , which ran at 1/200th of the speed ?
he again thinks modern software has slipped into , what he calls , a do less with more ethos .
paul otellini has been with intel for 34 years paul otellini : without knowing what he 's running on that machine , it 's pretty hard to diagnose it .
q : but do n't you think that is a common theme ?
paul otellini : no .
q : there is frustration amongst a lot of users that they are getting more and more powerful machines that do n't necessarily do things that much better than they did 10 years ago .
paul otellini : i disagree .
take what people do today - i do n't know if you have children , i do - my daughter spends all of her time with photographs , with videos and so forth .
you could n't even run those on a pc of five years ago .
you want to do some photo editing - try doing that on a five year-old machine versus a dual core machine .
q : now we 've got a couple of questions about wimax which of course is a technology which has promised much but not delivered a lot yet in terms of giving people access to broadband over a wide area .
they 're both from the developing world .
philippe thai from phnom penh in cambodia , and rawaz rauf from iraq .
they both really want to know what intel 's investment in wimax is going to mean for them - whether it 's going to bring big changes ?
paul otellini : we 're incorporating wimax into notebook starting this year .
it starts going into handheld devices , starting next year .
there are 120 deployments around the world today - it is starting to move as countries and cities are starting to get populated .
so i think you 'll sit here a year from now and you 'll have tens of millions of subscribers and you 'll move to hundreds of millions of subscribers say two years later than that - that 's pretty good .
q : femi alla from lagos , nigeria wonders why they have n't heard more about the classmate which is your rival to the one laptop per child project .
is it going to go any further than the couple of schools where she says the concept was demonstrated and which gave both projects a lot of media exposure ?
your questions for intel boss why have n't we heard more about the classmate pc ?
paul otellini : we are quite happy with where we are at ; we 're now in our second generation of the product - there are a lot of large contracts .
at the end of the day though , this is really focused on getting school districts affordable computing and that gets down to budgets and how fast people want to deploy them .
i 'm happy with where we are with the product .
q : nicolas negroponte who runs the one laptop per child project has been very harsh about intel 's attitude , claiming that you acted in bad faith and basically attempted to drive them out of countries like nigeria .
what do you say to that ?
paul otellini : i think i 've used this word with your network before - i think it is hogwash .
we did n't do anything that drove him out of anything .
we competed fairly for the business and it is a different computer model .
the two basic machines are approached , dealing with the problem of getting children laptops , differently .
ours is focused on working with teachers and having a teacher-driven education environment .
olpc is focused on , give the kids a laptop , turn them on to the internet and let them go .
we happen to think that the teaching model that works for teachers is a better model .
our laptop ships with teacher-control software ; so teachers can control what the kids are doing in class and be able to manage the process .
it 's a whole different thought process .
q : do you think their model will survive ?
can both models survive ?
paul otellini : i do n't see why not ; we 're having some success with ours and they 're having some success with theirs .
i think it gets down to what do the school districts want to do and when a school district chooses one versus the other , it does n't mean that the other one is wrong , it just means that they 've made a different choice in terms of the education profile they want to apply .
your questions for intel boss how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
q : moving on to one slightly quirky question here : chris barker , in otley , west yorkshire : how much longer do we have to listen to that incredibly annoying anthem every time someone mentions an intel chip ?
paul otellini : well i 'm quite fond of it .
so as long as i 'm around i think we 'll listen to it .
billions of people around the world have heard that bong and it identifies commercials with the company that is providing the technology inside it and i think it 's a very effective campaign .
q : a couple of personal questions : ibrahim faisal from the maldives wants to know about your personal technology .
what kind of laptop do you carry ?
paul otellini : it depends on what i 'm doing .
i 've got a centrino pro machine that i carry around with me for business and i 've got a mac i use for my photos at home .
q : are you equally comfortable with both ?
you must have a difficult line to tread on the mac versus pc battle these days .
paul otellini : not really .
both sides are customers so we 're quite happy with that and actually i 've enjoyed learning how to use a mac , it 's something i never did in the first part of my career and it 's nice seeing what both sides can do because i do different things with different machines .
q : so it 's a mac at home , pc at work kind of split is it ?
paul otellini : yes because our corporate environment is all pc-based and the technology we 've embedded into centrino pro , includes security and manageability features that i think are very important for enterprises like intel .
q : what about your email ?
how in touch are you ?
paul otellini : oh , i 'm 24/7 .
q : is it blackberry ?
is it on your phone ?
paul otellini : i 've a blackberry .
most of it i do on my laptop because the blackberry is nice when you 're walking down the hall or something but given the amount of email i have , i need a pretty good keyboard to be able to keep up with it .
q : do you ever feel that you 'd like to be disconnected from the internet for 24 hours ?
paul otellini : no .
i am not one of those people .
it 's pretty hard for me to disconnect from my job for 24 hours let alone the emails .
emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .
if i go away for the weekends sometimes , i may turn it off - but not too often .

q : finally , wes ramsay from tennessee in the united states wants you to look to the future and say one day you 'll retire , what professional accomplishment will you look back on with the greatest sense of satisfaction and what about a personal accomplishment ?
paul otellini : i 'm not done with my career yet , so it 's hard to project what you 're going to be most proud of .

both sides are customers so we 're quite happy with that and actually i 've enjoyed learning how to use a mac , it 's something i never did in the first part of my career and it 's nice seeing what both sides can do because i do different things with different machines .
q : so it 's a mac at home , pc at work kind of split is it ?
paul otellini : yes because our corporate environment is all pc-based and the technology we 've embedded into centrino pro , includes security and manageability features that i think are very important for enterprises like intel .
q : what about your email ?
how in touch are you ?
paul otellini : oh , i 'm 24/7 .
q : is it blackberry ?
is it on your phone ?
paul otellini : i 've a blackberry .
most of it i do on my laptop because the blackberry is nice when you 're walking down the hall or something but given the amount of email i have , i need a pretty good keyboard to be able to keep up with it .
q : do you ever feel that you 'd like to be disconnected from the internet for 24 hours ?
paul otellini : no .
i am not one of those people .
it 's pretty hard for me to disconnect from my job for 24 hours let alone the emails .
emails are the way we run the company ; it 's the way i talk to friends and customers , so it 's something that i like to do .
if i go away for the weekends sometimes , i may turn it off - but not too often .
q : you 're an addict , would you say ?
paul otellini : i do n't think so - maybe all addicts say no but i do n't think so because it 's my choice at the end of the day .
q : finally , wes ramsay from tennessee in the united states wants you to look to the future and say one day you 'll retire , what professional accomplishment will you look back on with the greatest sense of satisfaction and what about a personal accomplishment ?
paul otellini : i 'm not done with my career yet , so it 's hard to project what you 're going to be most proud of .
but to date , i think i 'm happiest with the fact that i 've been at a company for 34 years now that has changed the world inside the timeframe of my career and i 've had something to do with that .
it 's not often that corporations can say , with legitimacy , i changed the world because of what i do the world 's a better and different place .

youth worker shaun bailey explains how 15 years as a cadet kept him out of prison and made him who he is today .
when 12-year-old shaun bailey walked on to a west london council estate to join the army cadets - pretending he was 13 - he was by his own admission " gobby " and aggressive .
his mother was concerned he was falling into the wrong crowd and sent him off to 204 cadet company in white city , a 20-minute walk from the family home .
he now believes her decision was the making of him .
" cadets steered me away from crime and gave me an internal personal pride , " says bailey , now 36 and running a youth charity in the streets where he grew up . "
when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it " shaun bailey -lrb- pictured today -rrb- " it taught me how to succeed , which is key .
living on your estate , success is beating people up or making money by hustling . "
his motives on that first day were not aligned with his mother 's - he just wanted to be " rock hard " like a para and show off a " cool " uniform on the estate .
two evenings a week plus one weekend session were spent on activities such as shooting , adventure training , map reading , drill training or sports like football , athletics , rugby and gymnastics .
two weekends a month were spent on camp .
" it was very ' boys own ' - we went out and did stuff .
annual camp was the highlight of my life from the age of 13 to 25 , it was two weeks in the summer but i would start saving my money three to four months before . "
shaun 's key lessons taking orders from adults putting group above individual taking responsibility for others getting super-fit making lifelong friends learning about war although the unit 's 600-odd cadets were drawn from the local area , it was a bit of a " white boy " thing at the start , he says , but as time went by the recruits became more diverse .
" joining cadets was the point when i was starting to become different and my mates -lsb- on the estate -rsb- noticed it .
i was always asking them to join but they said they could n't stand having someone shouting at them .
" but you have to take orders , you have to be told stuff by adults and i carried that through to when i went home or when i went to school . "
ironed bedclothes once a youngster accepts discipline from an adult , then the rest of his life becomes easier , and the men giving orders to the cadets instantly earned respect .
" when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it .
but if a schoolteacher does that , the kid will jump up and talk about suing . "
cadets are taught that breaking a rule has consequences , says bailey , and his habit of using his fists to resolve conflict earned him a lot of press-ups when he first joined .
other punishments , for late timekeeping , dirty uniform or messing around , included the deprivation of rewards or blocked promotion .
combined cadet force a voluntary youth organisation for 13 to 18-year-olds it is not part of the armed forces there are 253 units in state and private schools many more units are based in communities began in the 1850s when some schools formed units attached to rifle volunteer battalions bailey says he became so dedicated to the rules and regulations that with a prize on offer for the cleanest room when on camp , he boot-polished his heater to make it less grubby-looking and slept on the floor because he had ironed his bedclothes .
" in the long-term it taught me to invest in myself .
i wanted to win -lsb- the tv show -rsb- superstars so i trained to do it .
i wanted to be promoted so i learnt to map-read , even though at the time , it was boring and hard .
" on the streets , most pay-offs are immediate or you do n't bother with them .
" a problem is getting young people to engage in something that wo n't pay off .
but sometimes you have to just hang on in there . "
aged 17 he was tempted to join the army but decided to focus his energy into helping wayward youngsters in his community .
he continued in the cadets for another 10 years as a sergeant instructor .
tim connolly , who was bailey 's captain when he joined , recalls a boy who needed direction .
" i think he got out of the cadets things he was n't getting out of schooling .
we saw him mature and he became a very able young man . "
but not everyone believes the army is a positive influence on young people .
teachers have opposed the forces recruiting in schools because they fear the classroom being militarised .
bailey disagrees and thinks its influence on young people is all positive .
his experience made him realise how futile war is , he says , because a trip to arnhem aged 16 , to meet veterans and see the graves , enabled him to see beyond the hollywood version of the battlefield .
and far from fetishising guns , he says handling a rifle has generated a " loathing " in him for firearms .
unfortunately for some of his early friends , violence was their undoing .
a few got into trouble and were jailed and some even lost their lives .
bailey recalls one particular night when if he had n't been at cadets he would have joined his friends in burgling a factory , a misadventure that led to them all being arrested .
" i sometimes think that the problems that led them down that alley , the skills i learnt in cadets could have saved them .
" when i try to make sense of why i am who i am and why they are who they are , i ca n't escape the fact i was a cadet .
it was absolutely vital . "
below is a selection of your comments : i do not believe that expansion of the ccf is the way forward .
i was once a cadet with the air training corps in grays , essex - not affiliated in any way with a school .
there are many of these squadrons / units across the country and it is these that require the most support .
the ccf can draw from the schools ' ranks ' at the end of the day - a normal atc , army cadet or sea cadet unit needs to recruit from the streets which , apart from joining up , is the toughest task they face .
david neve , lincoln , england i was in the cadets at school and i agree with a lot of the article - it gave me confidence ; the realisation of the futility of war ; how dangerous a rifle or pistol really is ; and to take pride in what i do .
but i also encountered ncos -lrb- essentially older pupils -rrb- who abused their positions of authority .
now anyone who wants my respect must earn it .
just shouting at me to do something is not going to get a reaction , but telling me a valid reason why i must do what they say will .
in the end , i too did n't join the armed forces for that very reason - that i could n't accept orders blindly without being given a valid reason .
matthew , uk as a cadet services instructor of some years i know that what this young man says to be true , however , the value of what we do is gradually being eroded by the politically correct and mindless application of petty h & s rules all of which is reducing the quality and authenticity on the training we can provide. for instance there is a strong undercurrent in my service to prevent cadets shooting and it is now very difficult to arrange range time for them because ' guns are not politically correct ' also we are now specifically barred from ordering press-ups as a punishment unless we are ' qualified ' ptis and we are not supposed to shout at them even though sometimes you must for safety reasons .
on the subject of discipline , it is very noticeable that the cadets who are sent ' to get some discipline ' and receive none at home do not do well as the ca n't understand why they are not allowed to freely interpret their orders so this young man must have had a parental base on which to build as do all the cadets peter , worthing uk having been a former cadet warrant officer in the raf section of the ccf , my opinion of the ccf is more ambivalent than shaun bailey 's .
although the discipline and focus demanded really can transform negative attitudes and keep kids out of trouble , there are major problems inherent in the system .
one such problem , highlighted by teachers ' recent complaints about the militarization of the classroom , is that the ccf becomes a subtle recruitment tool for the armed services , presenting only the positive aspects of a life in the military and ignoring more important ethical issues .
i myself came very close to seeking an raf commission to pay me through medical school , which would have been a 12 year commitment .
this is a decision that i now realise would have been impossible to make at such a young age .
stricter emphasis must be placed on the seriousness of a career in the military -lrb- it is not a decision to be taken lightly at the age of 17 , even though this is many people 's experience -rrb- ; there should be more control over how the ccf interacts with the rest of the school community ; and there should be at the very least some attention to the ethical consequences of using military force in combat .
luke martin , oxford i went to a military boarding school in kent , and the morals , discipline and manners that it taught my peers and me were invaluable .
we learned to respect authority the hard way , and we were n't pandered to in any way .
the military tradition , including cadets , was an integral part of our education .
looking at my school friends now , there are none that i know of that have trodden a wayward path in life .
i do think there was also a distinct advantage in that we were all boarders , and the staff had total control over our free time .
detention was n't half an hour after school , it was an hour on a saturday night when all your mates were doing their own thing !
cadets is a voluntary activity for most kids now , whereas for us there was no choice , and i think that a lot of teenagers would quit when the going got tough .
make it mandatory , and bring back national service !
f , notts whilst i appreciate the difference between joining the cadets and the regular army , does this move not fly in the face of recent decisions by schools to stop the army recruiting from within them ?
surely the benefits to young men with a career in the regular army can be just as tangible as those provided by the cadets ?
simon reynolds , milton keynes i am an adult volunteer with the air cadets and a former air cadet myself and it 's true that being a cadet makes a massive difference to the lives of many young people .
i would like to stress that it is n't just for boys and it certainly is n't just for those who have behavioural problems - every youngster can benefit and often those who are quite shy and quiet find a way to express themselves and flourish once wearing a uniform and participating in such exciting activities .
i would encourage all parents to take their sons and daughters along to their local cadet unit -lrb- not in schools but in your local community -rrb- and have a look - it 's very cheap and very exciting - and do n't tell the kids but it 's hugely educational too ! !
paula , stowmarket , suffolk i have been youth leader for 43 years in the boys ' brigade and currently in the air training corps .
the experience of shaun bailey is not unusual .
the discipline in uniformed organisations , sets boundaries of behaviour , enables young people to earn respect , take on responsibility .
it does not really matter which organisation , but all children should be encouraged to join one of them - it will be the making of them !
alan rashleigh , poynton , cheshire , uk i was an air cadet for four yrs and loved every moment .
i did n't join because i was a teenager going off the rails , i joined because i was thinking of joining the raf and wanted some direction to my life .
i loved how smart everyone looked in their blue / grey uniforms and the air of discipline in the sqdrn building .
joining the atc opened up so many opportunities any other kid on the street would n't have .
i learned to play an instrument in the band , i loved drill and competed at a regional level , i competed in the annual sports days , i took rifle practice , had radio training and piloted a light aircraft and that was just for starters !
i even gained the bronze and silver duke of edinburgh awards .
if i could turn back time , i would do it all again and more - i was an extremely proud cadet , the sense of pride when we all did something or won something as a team - a squadron was immense .
vicky prince , oldham i have been in the air training corps for just over three years now and plan to stay as long as i can in the corps .
and it has kept me on the right path through life - this is a great idea , although i think that it would be much better for there to be a greater publicity for the air training corps to get people to join that organisation - it gives you great skills for life and it is what employers love .
i do n't recall the ccf doing many helpful things which encompass all of the cadet forces , however , i know that the atc has a huge list of activities available - from fieldcraft to shooting , from flying to parachuting - there 's something for everyone .
luke carter , coventry i was in the army section of combined cadets at school and i had an immense amount of fun for four years .
a lot of people think it is a recruitment tool for the armed services but i never once encountered a situation where i felt i was being press-ganged into the army .
although national service is against many people 's taste , why not have that alongside government sponsored community projects as an alternative - so long as everybody does something , everybody wins .
james battersby , west molesey , surrey , uk i joined the cadets at 13 and ended up in the ta as an officer .
i am now 32 .
i think that we need some military discipline back in society .
being taught you are not the biggest and hardest .
we need to show those carrying guns or knives on the streets that without them they are not ' big men ' .
i do not understand teachers saying they do n't want this when it might just stop attacks on them and breed some respect .
andy , dubai , uae at the age of 11 , i joined the cadets - but it was st john ambulance cadets in my case .
in a similar way to the combined cadet force , st john ambulance allowed me to develop a sense of pride and self-discipline .
trips to camp taught me that in society , everyone needs to play their part , because on camp , everyone helped with the cleaning , washing and tidying .
if you did n't help , you lost the respect of your peers .
being a cadet with st john ambulance has been the biggest factor in getting my job today , where i work for st john ambulance recruiting volunteer youth leaders to ensure our cadet groups can continue to run .

and it has kept me on the right path through life - this is a great idea , although i think that it would be much better for there to be a greater publicity for the air training corps to get people to join that organisation - it gives you great skills for life and it is what employers love .
i do n't recall the ccf doing many helpful things which encompass all of the cadet forces , however , i know that the atc has a huge list of activities available - from fieldcraft to shooting , from flying to parachuting - there 's something for everyone .
luke carter , coventry i was in the army section of combined cadets at school and i had an immense amount of fun for four years .
a lot of people think it is a recruitment tool for the armed services but i never once encountered a situation where i felt i was being press-ganged into the army .
although national service is against many people 's taste , why not have that alongside government sponsored community projects as an alternative - so long as everybody does something , everybody wins .
james battersby , west molesey , surrey , uk i joined the cadets at 13 and ended up in the ta as an officer .
i am now 32 .
i think that we need some military discipline back in society .
being taught you are not the biggest and hardest .
we need to show those carrying guns or knives on the streets that without them they are not ' big men ' .
i do not understand teachers saying they do n't want this when it might just stop attacks on them and breed some respect .
andy , dubai , uae at the age of 11 , i joined the cadets - but it was st john ambulance cadets in my case .
in a similar way to the combined cadet force , st john ambulance allowed me to develop a sense of pride and self-discipline .
trips to camp taught me that in society , everyone needs to play their part , because on camp , everyone helped with the cleaning , washing and tidying .
if you did n't help , you lost the respect of your peers .
being a cadet with st john ambulance has been the biggest factor in getting my job today , where i work for st john ambulance recruiting volunteer youth leaders to ensure our cadet groups can continue to run .

youth worker shaun bailey explains how 15 years as a cadet kept him out of prison and made him who he is today .
when 12-year-old shaun bailey walked on to a west london council estate to join the army cadets - pretending he was 13 - he was by his own admission " gobby " and aggressive .
his mother was concerned he was falling into the wrong crowd and sent him off to 204 cadet company in white city , a 20-minute walk from the family home .
he now believes her decision was the making of him .
" cadets steered me away from crime and gave me an internal personal pride , " says bailey , now 36 and running a youth charity in the streets where he grew up .
when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it shaun bailey -lrb- pictured today -rrb- " it taught me how to succeed , which is key .
living on your estate , success is beating people up or making money by hustling . "
his motives on that first day were not aligned with his mother 's - he just wanted to be " rock hard " like a para and show off a " cool " uniform on the estate .
two evenings a week plus one weekend session were spent on activities such as shooting , adventure training , map reading , drill training or sports like football , athletics , rugby and gymnastics .
two weekends a month were spent on camp .
" it was very ' boys own ' - we went out and did stuff .
annual camp was the highlight of my life from the age of 13 to 25 , it was two weeks in the summer but i would start saving my money three to four months before . "
shaun 's key lessons taking orders from adults putting group above individual taking responsibility for others getting super-fit making lifelong friends learning about war although the unit 's 600-odd cadets were drawn from the local area , it was a bit of a " white boy " thing at the start , he says , but as time went by the recruits became more diverse .
" joining cadets was the point when i was starting to become different and my mates -lsb- on the estate -rsb- noticed it .
i was always asking them to join but they said they could n't stand having someone shouting at them .
" but you have to take orders , you have to be told stuff by adults and i carried that through to when i went home or when i went to school . "
ironed bedclothes once a youngster accepts discipline from an adult , then the rest of his life becomes easier , and the men giving orders to the cadets instantly earned respect .
" when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it .
but if a schoolteacher does that , the kid will jump up and talk about suing . "
cadets are taught that breaking a rule has consequences , says bailey , and his habit of using his fists to resolve conflict earned him a lot of press-ups when he first joined .
other punishments , for late timekeeping , dirty uniform or messing around , included the deprivation of rewards or blocked promotion .
combined cadet force a voluntary youth organisation for 13 to 18-year-olds it is not part of the armed forces there are 253 units in state and private schools many more units are based in communities began in the 1850s when some schools formed units attached to rifle volunteer battalions bailey says he became so dedicated to the rules and regulations that with a prize on offer for the cleanest room when on camp , he boot-polished his heater to make it less grubby-looking and slept on the floor because he had ironed his bedclothes .
" in the long-term it taught me to invest in myself .
i wanted to win -lsb- the tv show -rsb- superstars so i trained to do it .
i wanted to be promoted so i learnt to map-read , even though at the time , it was boring and hard .
" on the streets , most pay-offs are immediate or you do n't bother with them .
" a problem is getting young people to engage in something that wo n't pay off .
but sometimes you have to just hang on in there . "
aged 17 he was tempted to join the army but decided to focus his energy into helping wayward youngsters in his community .
he continued in the cadets for another 10 years as a sergeant instructor .
tim connolly , who was bailey 's captain when he joined , recalls a boy who needed direction .
" i think he got out of the cadets things he was n't getting out of schooling .
we saw him mature and he became a very able young man . "
but not everyone believes the army is a positive influence on young people .
teachers have opposed the forces recruiting in schools because they fear the classroom being militarised .
bailey disagrees and thinks its influence on young people is all positive .
the answer to youth crime ?
his experience made him realise how futile war is , he says , because a trip to arnhem aged 16 , to meet veterans and see the graves , enabled him to see beyond the hollywood version of the battlefield .
and far from fetishising guns , he says handling a rifle has generated a " loathing " in him for firearms .
unfortunately for some of his early friends , violence was their undoing .
a few got into trouble and were jailed and some even lost their lives .
bailey recalls one particular night when if he had n't been at cadets he would have joined his friends in burgling a factory , a misadventure that led to them all being arrested .
" i sometimes think that the problems that led them down that alley , the skills i learnt in cadets could have saved them .
" when i try to make sense of why i am who i am and why they are who they are , i ca n't escape the fact i was a cadet .
it was absolutely vital . "
below is a selection of your comments : i do not believe that expansion of the ccf is the way forward .
i was once a cadet with the air training corps in grays , essex - not affiliated in any way with a school .
there are many of these squadrons / units across the country and it is these that require the most support .
the ccf can draw from the schools ' ranks ' at the end of the day - a normal atc , army cadet or sea cadet unit needs to recruit from the streets which , apart from joining up , is the toughest task they face .
david neve , lincoln , england i was in the cadets at school and i agree with a lot of the article - it gave me confidence ; the realisation of the futility of war ; how dangerous a rifle or pistol really is ; and to take pride in what i do .
but i also encountered ncos -lrb- essentially older pupils -rrb- who abused their positions of authority .
now anyone who wants my respect must earn it .
just shouting at me to do something is not going to get a reaction , but telling me a valid reason why i must do what they say will .
in the end , i too did n't join the armed forces for that very reason - that i could n't accept orders blindly without being given a valid reason .
matthew , uk as a cadet services instructor of some years i know that what this young man says to be true , however , the value of what we do is gradually being eroded by the politically correct and mindless application of petty h & s rules all of which is reducing the quality and authenticity on the training we can provide. for instance there is a strong undercurrent in my service to prevent cadets shooting and it is now very difficult to arrange range time for them because ' guns are not politically correct ' also we are now specifically barred from ordering press-ups as a punishment unless we are ' qualified ' ptis and we are not supposed to shout at them even though sometimes you must for safety reasons .
on the subject of discipline , it is very noticeable that the cadets who are sent ' to get some discipline ' and receive none at home do not do well as the ca n't understand why they are not allowed to freely interpret their orders so this young man must have had a parental base on which to build as do all the cadets peter , worthing uk having been a former cadet warrant officer in the raf section of the ccf , my opinion of the ccf is more ambivalent than shaun bailey 's .
although the discipline and focus demanded really can transform negative attitudes and keep kids out of trouble , there are major problems inherent in the system .
one such problem , highlighted by teachers ' recent complaints about the militarization of the classroom , is that the ccf becomes a subtle recruitment tool for the armed services , presenting only the positive aspects of a life in the military and ignoring more important ethical issues .
i myself came very close to seeking an raf commission to pay me through medical school , which would have been a 12 year commitment .
this is a decision that i now realise would have been impossible to make at such a young age .
stricter emphasis must be placed on the seriousness of a career in the military -lrb- it is not a decision to be taken lightly at the age of 17 , even though this is many people 's experience -rrb- ; there should be more control over how the ccf interacts with the rest of the school community ; and there should be at the very least some attention to the ethical consequences of using military force in combat .
luke martin , oxford i went to a military boarding school in kent , and the morals , discipline and manners that it taught my peers and me were invaluable .
we learned to respect authority the hard way , and we were n't pandered to in any way .
the military tradition , including cadets , was an integral part of our education .
looking at my school friends now , there are none that i know of that have trodden a wayward path in life .
i do think there was also a distinct advantage in that we were all boarders , and the staff had total control over our free time .
detention was n't half an hour after school , it was an hour on a saturday night when all your mates were doing their own thing !
cadets is a voluntary activity for most kids now , whereas for us there was no choice , and i think that a lot of teenagers would quit when the going got tough .
make it mandatory , and bring back national service !
f , notts whilst i appreciate the difference between joining the cadets and the regular army , does this move not fly in the face of recent decisions by schools to stop the army recruiting from within them ?
surely the benefits to young men with a career in the regular army can be just as tangible as those provided by the cadets ?
simon reynolds , milton keynes i am an adult volunteer with the air cadets and a former air cadet myself and it 's true that being a cadet makes a massive difference to the lives of many young people .
i would like to stress that it is n't just for boys and it certainly is n't just for those who have behavioural problems - every youngster can benefit and often those who are quite shy and quiet find a way to express themselves and flourish once wearing a uniform and participating in such exciting activities .
i would encourage all parents to take their sons and daughters along to their local cadet unit -lrb- not in schools but in your local community -rrb- and have a look - it 's very cheap and very exciting - and do n't tell the kids but it 's hugely educational too ! !
paula , stowmarket , suffolk i have been youth leader for 43 years in the boys ' brigade and currently in the air training corps .
the experience of shaun bailey is not unusual .
the discipline in uniformed organisations , sets boundaries of behaviour , enables young people to earn respect , take on responsibility .
it does not really matter which organisation , but all children should be encouraged to join one of them - it will be the making of them !
alan rashleigh , poynton , cheshire , uk i was an air cadet for four yrs and loved every moment .
i did n't join because i was a teenager going off the rails , i joined because i was thinking of joining the raf and wanted some direction to my life .
i loved how smart everyone looked in their blue / grey uniforms and the air of discipline in the sqdrn building .
joining the atc opened up so many opportunities any other kid on the street would n't have .
i learned to play an instrument in the band , i loved drill and competed at a regional level , i competed in the annual sports days , i took rifle practice , had radio training and piloted a light aircraft and that was just for starters !
i even gained the bronze and silver duke of edinburgh awards .
if i could turn back time , i would do it all again and more - i was an extremely proud cadet , the sense of pride when we all did something or won something as a team - a squadron was immense .
vicky prince , oldham i have been in the air training corps for just over three years now and plan to stay as long as i can in the corps .
and it has kept me on the right path through life - this is a great idea , although i think that it would be much better for there to be a greater publicity for the air training corps to get people to join that organisation - it gives you great skills for life and it is what employers love .
i do n't recall the ccf doing many helpful things which encompass all of the cadet forces , however , i know that the atc has a huge list of activities available - from fieldcraft to shooting , from flying to parachuting - there 's something for everyone .
luke carter , coventry i was in the army section of combined cadets at school and i had an immense amount of fun for four years .
a lot of people think it is a recruitment tool for the armed services but i never once encountered a situation where i felt i was being press-ganged into the army .

i would encourage all parents to take their sons and daughters along to their local cadet unit -lrb- not in schools but in your local community -rrb- and have a look - it 's very cheap and very exciting - and do n't tell the kids but it 's hugely educational too ! !
paula , stowmarket , suffolk i have been youth leader for 43 years in the boys ' brigade and currently in the air training corps .
the experience of shaun bailey is not unusual .
the discipline in uniformed organisations , sets boundaries of behaviour , enables young people to earn respect , take on responsibility .
it does not really matter which organisation , but all children should be encouraged to join one of them - it will be the making of them !
alan rashleigh , poynton , cheshire , uk i was an air cadet for four yrs and loved every moment .
i did n't join because i was a teenager going off the rails , i joined because i was thinking of joining the raf and wanted some direction to my life .
i loved how smart everyone looked in their blue / grey uniforms and the air of discipline in the sqdrn building .
joining the atc opened up so many opportunities any other kid on the street would n't have .
i learned to play an instrument in the band , i loved drill and competed at a regional level , i competed in the annual sports days , i took rifle practice , had radio training and piloted a light aircraft and that was just for starters !
i even gained the bronze and silver duke of edinburgh awards .
if i could turn back time , i would do it all again and more - i was an extremely proud cadet , the sense of pride when we all did something or won something as a team - a squadron was immense .
vicky prince , oldham i have been in the air training corps for just over three years now and plan to stay as long as i can in the corps .
and it has kept me on the right path through life - this is a great idea , although i think that it would be much better for there to be a greater publicity for the air training corps to get people to join that organisation - it gives you great skills for life and it is what employers love .
i do n't recall the ccf doing many helpful things which encompass all of the cadet forces , however , i know that the atc has a huge list of activities available - from fieldcraft to shooting , from flying to parachuting - there 's something for everyone .
luke carter , coventry i was in the army section of combined cadets at school and i had an immense amount of fun for four years .
a lot of people think it is a recruitment tool for the armed services but i never once encountered a situation where i felt i was being press-ganged into the army .
although national service is against many people 's taste , why not have that alongside government sponsored community projects as an alternative - so long as everybody does something , everybody wins .
james battersby , west molesey , surrey , uk i joined the cadets at 13 and ended up in the ta as an officer .
i am now 32 .
i think that we need some military discipline back in society .
being taught you are not the biggest and hardest .
we need to show those carrying guns or knives on the streets that without them they are not ' big men ' .
i do not understand teachers saying they do n't want this when it might just stop attacks on them and breed some respect .
andy , dubai , uae at the age of 11 , i joined the cadets - but it was st john ambulance cadets in my case .
in a similar way to the combined cadet force , st john ambulance allowed me to develop a sense of pride and self-discipline .
trips to camp taught me that in society , everyone needs to play their part , because on camp , everyone helped with the cleaning , washing and tidying .
if you did n't help , you lost the respect of your peers .
being a cadet with st john ambulance has been the biggest factor in getting my job today , where i work for st john ambulance recruiting volunteer youth leaders to ensure our cadet groups can continue to run .

youth worker shaun bailey explains how 15 years as a cadet kept him out of prison and made him who he is today .
when 12-year-old shaun bailey walked on to a west london council estate to join the army cadets - pretending he was 13 - he was by his own admission " gobby " and aggressive .
his mother was concerned he was falling into the wrong crowd and sent him off to 204 cadet company in white city , a 20-minute walk from the family home .
he now believes her decision was the making of him .
" cadets steered me away from crime and gave me an internal personal pride , " says bailey , now 36 and running a youth charity in the streets where he grew up .
when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it shaun bailey -lrb- pictured today -rrb- " it taught me how to succeed , which is key .
living on your estate , success is beating people up or making money by hustling . "
his motives on that first day were not aligned with his mother 's - he just wanted to be " rock hard " like a para and show off a " cool " uniform on the estate .
two evenings a week plus one weekend session were spent on activities such as shooting , adventure training , map reading , drill training or sports like football , athletics , rugby and gymnastics .
two weekends a month were spent on camp .
" it was very ' boys own ' - we went out and did stuff .
annual camp was the highlight of my life from the age of 13 to 25 , it was two weeks in the summer but i would start saving my money three to four months before . "
shaun 's key lessons taking orders from adults putting group above individual taking responsibility for others getting super-fit making lifelong friends learning about war although the unit 's 600-odd cadets were drawn from the local area , it was a bit of a " white boy " thing at the start , he says , but as time went by the recruits became more diverse .
" joining cadets was the point when i was starting to become different and my mates -lsb- on the estate -rsb- noticed it .
i was always asking them to join but they said they could n't stand having someone shouting at them .
" but you have to take orders , you have to be told stuff by adults and i carried that through to when i went home or when i went to school . "
ironed bedclothes once a youngster accepts discipline from an adult , then the rest of his life becomes easier , and the men giving orders to the cadets instantly earned respect .
" when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it .
but if a schoolteacher does that , the kid will jump up and talk about suing . "
cadets are taught that breaking a rule has consequences , says bailey , and his habit of using his fists to resolve conflict earned him a lot of press-ups when he first joined .
other punishments , for late timekeeping , dirty uniform or messing around , included the deprivation of rewards or blocked promotion .
combined cadet force a voluntary youth organisation for 13 to 18-year-olds it is not part of the armed forces there are 253 units in state and private schools many more units are based in communities began in the 1850s when some schools formed units attached to rifle volunteer battalions bailey says he became so dedicated to the rules and regulations that with a prize on offer for the cleanest room when on camp , he boot-polished his heater to make it less grubby-looking and slept on the floor because he had ironed his bedclothes .
" in the long-term it taught me to invest in myself .
i wanted to win -lsb- the tv show -rsb- superstars so i trained to do it .
i wanted to be promoted so i learnt to map-read , even though at the time , it was boring and hard .
" on the streets , most pay-offs are immediate or you do n't bother with them .
" a problem is getting young people to engage in something that wo n't pay off .
but sometimes you have to just hang on in there . "
aged 17 he was tempted to join the army but decided to focus his energy into helping wayward youngsters in his community .
he continued in the cadets for another 10 years as a sergeant instructor .
tim connolly , who was bailey 's captain when he joined , recalls a boy who needed direction .
" i think he got out of the cadets things he was n't getting out of schooling .
we saw him mature and he became a very able young man . "
but not everyone believes the army is a positive influence on young people .
teachers have opposed the forces recruiting in schools because they fear the classroom being militarised .
bailey disagrees and thinks its influence on young people is all positive .
the answer to youth crime ?
his experience made him realise how futile war is , he says , because a trip to arnhem aged 16 , to meet veterans and see the graves , enabled him to see beyond the hollywood version of the battlefield .
and far from fetishising guns , he says handling a rifle has generated a " loathing " in him for firearms .
unfortunately for some of his early friends , violence was their undoing .
a few got into trouble and were jailed and some even lost their lives .
bailey recalls one particular night when if he had n't been at cadets he would have joined his friends in burgling a factory , a misadventure that led to them all being arrested .
" i sometimes think that the problems that led them down that alley , the skills i learnt in cadets could have saved them .
" when i try to make sense of why i am who i am and why they are who they are , i ca n't escape the fact i was a cadet .
it was absolutely vital . "
below is a selection of your comments : i do not believe that expansion of the ccf is the way forward .
i was once a cadet with the air training corps in grays , essex - not affiliated in any way with a school .
there are many of these squadrons / units across the country and it is these that require the most support .
the ccf can draw from the schools ' ranks ' at the end of the day - a normal atc , army cadet or sea cadet unit needs to recruit from the streets which , apart from joining up , is the toughest task they face .
david neve , lincoln , england i was in the cadets at school and i agree with a lot of the article - it gave me confidence ; the realisation of the futility of war ; how dangerous a rifle or pistol really is ; and to take pride in what i do .
but i also encountered ncos -lrb- essentially older pupils -rrb- who abused their positions of authority .
now anyone who wants my respect must earn it .
just shouting at me to do something is not going to get a reaction , but telling me a valid reason why i must do what they say will .
in the end , i too did n't join the armed forces for that very reason - that i could n't accept orders blindly without being given a valid reason .
matthew , uk as a cadet services instructor of some years i know that what this young man says to be true , however , the value of what we do is gradually being eroded by the politically correct and mindless application of petty h & s rules all of which is reducing the quality and authenticity on the training we can provide. for instance there is a strong undercurrent in my service to prevent cadets shooting and it is now very difficult to arrange range time for them because ' guns are not politically correct ' also we are now specifically barred from ordering press-ups as a punishment unless we are ' qualified ' ptis and we are not supposed to shout at them even though sometimes you must for safety reasons .
on the subject of discipline , it is very noticeable that the cadets who are sent ' to get some discipline ' and receive none at home do not do well as the ca n't understand why they are not allowed to freely interpret their orders so this young man must have had a parental base on which to build as do all the cadets peter , worthing uk having been a former cadet warrant officer in the raf section of the ccf , my opinion of the ccf is more ambivalent than shaun bailey 's .
although the discipline and focus demanded really can transform negative attitudes and keep kids out of trouble , there are major problems inherent in the system .
one such problem , highlighted by teachers ' recent complaints about the militarization of the classroom , is that the ccf becomes a subtle recruitment tool for the armed services , presenting only the positive aspects of a life in the military and ignoring more important ethical issues .
i myself came very close to seeking an raf commission to pay me through medical school , which would have been a 12 year commitment .
this is a decision that i now realise would have been impossible to make at such a young age .
stricter emphasis must be placed on the seriousness of a career in the military -lrb- it is not a decision to be taken lightly at the age of 17 , even though this is many people 's experience -rrb- ; there should be more control over how the ccf interacts with the rest of the school community ; and there should be at the very least some attention to the ethical consequences of using military force in combat .
luke martin , oxford i went to a military boarding school in kent , and the morals , discipline and manners that it taught my peers and me were invaluable .
we learned to respect authority the hard way , and we were n't pandered to in any way .
the military tradition , including cadets , was an integral part of our education .
looking at my school friends now , there are none that i know of that have trodden a wayward path in life .
i do think there was also a distinct advantage in that we were all boarders , and the staff had total control over our free time .
detention was n't half an hour after school , it was an hour on a saturday night when all your mates were doing their own thing !
cadets is a voluntary activity for most kids now , whereas for us there was no choice , and i think that a lot of teenagers would quit when the going got tough .
make it mandatory , and bring back national service !
f , notts whilst i appreciate the difference between joining the cadets and the regular army , does this move not fly in the face of recent decisions by schools to stop the army recruiting from within them ?
surely the benefits to young men with a career in the regular army can be just as tangible as those provided by the cadets ?
simon reynolds , milton keynes i am an adult volunteer with the air cadets and a former air cadet myself and it 's true that being a cadet makes a massive difference to the lives of many young people .

stricter emphasis must be placed on the seriousness of a career in the military -lrb- it is not a decision to be taken lightly at the age of 17 , even though this is many people 's experience -rrb- ; there should be more control over how the ccf interacts with the rest of the school community ; and there should be at the very least some attention to the ethical consequences of using military force in combat .
luke martin , oxford i went to a military boarding school in kent , and the morals , discipline and manners that it taught my peers and me were invaluable .
we learned to respect authority the hard way , and we were n't pandered to in any way .
the military tradition , including cadets , was an integral part of our education .
looking at my school friends now , there are none that i know of that have trodden a wayward path in life .
i do think there was also a distinct advantage in that we were all boarders , and the staff had total control over our free time .
detention was n't half an hour after school , it was an hour on a saturday night when all your mates were doing their own thing !
cadets is a voluntary activity for most kids now , whereas for us there was no choice , and i think that a lot of teenagers would quit when the going got tough .
make it mandatory , and bring back national service !
f , notts whilst i appreciate the difference between joining the cadets and the regular army , does this move not fly in the face of recent decisions by schools to stop the army recruiting from within them ?
surely the benefits to young men with a career in the regular army can be just as tangible as those provided by the cadets ?

i would encourage all parents to take their sons and daughters along to their local cadet unit -lrb- not in schools but in your local community -rrb- and have a look - it 's very cheap and very exciting - and do n't tell the kids but it 's hugely educational too ! !

youth worker shaun bailey explains how 15 years as a cadet kept him out of prison and made him who he is today .
when 12-year-old shaun bailey walked on to a west london council estate to join the army cadets - pretending he was 13 - he was by his own admission " gobby " and aggressive .
his mother was concerned he was falling into the wrong crowd and sent him off to 204 cadet company in white city , a 20-minute walk from the family home .
he now believes her decision was the making of him .
" cadets steered me away from crime and gave me an internal personal pride , " says bailey , now 36 and running a youth charity in the streets where he grew up .
when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it shaun bailey -lrb- pictured today -rrb- " it taught me how to succeed , which is key .
living on your estate , success is beating people up or making money by hustling . "
his motives on that first day were not aligned with his mother 's - he just wanted to be " rock hard " like a para and show off a " cool " uniform on the estate .
two evenings a week plus one weekend session were spent on activities such as shooting , adventure training , map reading , drill training or sports like football , athletics , rugby and gymnastics .
two weekends a month were spent on camp .
" it was very ' boys own ' - we went out and did stuff .
annual camp was the highlight of my life from the age of 13 to 25 , it was two weeks in the summer but i would start saving my money three to four months before . "
shaun 's key lessons taking orders from adults putting group above individual taking responsibility for others getting super-fit making lifelong friends learning about war although the unit 's 600-odd cadets were drawn from the local area , it was a bit of a " white boy " thing at the start , he says , but as time went by the recruits became more diverse .
" joining cadets was the point when i was starting to become different and my mates -lsb- on the estate -rsb- noticed it .
i was always asking them to join but they said they could n't stand having someone shouting at them .
" but you have to take orders , you have to be told stuff by adults and i carried that through to when i went home or when i went to school . "
ironed bedclothes once a youngster accepts discipline from an adult , then the rest of his life becomes easier , and the men giving orders to the cadets instantly earned respect .
" when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it .
but if a schoolteacher does that , the kid will jump up and talk about suing . "
cadets are taught that breaking a rule has consequences , says bailey , and his habit of using his fists to resolve conflict earned him a lot of press-ups when he first joined .
other punishments , for late timekeeping , dirty uniform or messing around , included the deprivation of rewards or blocked promotion .
combined cadet force a voluntary youth organisation for 13 to 18-year-olds it is not part of the armed forces there are 253 units in state and private schools many more units are based in communities began in the 1850s when some schools formed units attached to rifle volunteer battalions bailey says he became so dedicated to the rules and regulations that with a prize on offer for the cleanest room when on camp , he boot-polished his heater to make it less grubby-looking and slept on the floor because he had ironed his bedclothes .
" in the long-term it taught me to invest in myself .
i wanted to win -lsb- the tv show -rsb- superstars so i trained to do it .
i wanted to be promoted so i learnt to map-read , even though at the time , it was boring and hard .
" on the streets , most pay-offs are immediate or you do n't bother with them .
" a problem is getting young people to engage in something that wo n't pay off .
but sometimes you have to just hang on in there . "
aged 17 he was tempted to join the army but decided to focus his energy into helping wayward youngsters in his community .
he continued in the cadets for another 10 years as a sergeant instructor .
tim connolly , who was bailey 's captain when he joined , recalls a boy who needed direction .
" i think he got out of the cadets things he was n't getting out of schooling .
we saw him mature and he became a very able young man . "
but not everyone believes the army is a positive influence on young people .
teachers have opposed the forces recruiting in schools because they fear the classroom being militarised .
bailey disagrees and thinks its influence on young people is all positive .
the answer to youth crime ?
his experience made him realise how futile war is , he says , because a trip to arnhem aged 16 , to meet veterans and see the graves , enabled him to see beyond the hollywood version of the battlefield .
and far from fetishising guns , he says handling a rifle has generated a " loathing " in him for firearms .
unfortunately for some of his early friends , violence was their undoing .
a few got into trouble and were jailed and some even lost their lives .
bailey recalls one particular night when if he had n't been at cadets he would have joined his friends in burgling a factory , a misadventure that led to them all being arrested .
" i sometimes think that the problems that led them down that alley , the skills i learnt in cadets could have saved them .
" when i try to make sense of why i am who i am and why they are who they are , i ca n't escape the fact i was a cadet .
it was absolutely vital . "
below is a selection of your comments : i do not believe that expansion of the ccf is the way forward .
i was once a cadet with the air training corps in grays , essex - not affiliated in any way with a school .
there are many of these squadrons / units across the country and it is these that require the most support .
the ccf can draw from the schools ' ranks ' at the end of the day - a normal atc , army cadet or sea cadet unit needs to recruit from the streets which , apart from joining up , is the toughest task they face .
david neve , lincoln , england i was in the cadets at school and i agree with a lot of the article - it gave me confidence ; the realisation of the futility of war ; how dangerous a rifle or pistol really is ; and to take pride in what i do .
but i also encountered ncos -lrb- essentially older pupils -rrb- who abused their positions of authority .
now anyone who wants my respect must earn it .
just shouting at me to do something is not going to get a reaction , but telling me a valid reason why i must do what they say will .
in the end , i too did n't join the armed forces for that very reason - that i could n't accept orders blindly without being given a valid reason .
matthew , uk as a cadet services instructor of some years i know that what this young man says to be true , however , the value of what we do is gradually being eroded by the politically correct and mindless application of petty h & s rules all of which is reducing the quality and authenticity on the training we can provide. for instance there is a strong undercurrent in my service to prevent cadets shooting and it is now very difficult to arrange range time for them because ' guns are not politically correct ' also we are now specifically barred from ordering press-ups as a punishment unless we are ' qualified ' ptis and we are not supposed to shout at them even though sometimes you must for safety reasons .
on the subject of discipline , it is very noticeable that the cadets who are sent ' to get some discipline ' and receive none at home do not do well as the ca n't understand why they are not allowed to freely interpret their orders so this young man must have had a parental base on which to build as do all the cadets peter , worthing uk having been a former cadet warrant officer in the raf section of the ccf , my opinion of the ccf is more ambivalent than shaun bailey 's .
although the discipline and focus demanded really can transform negative attitudes and keep kids out of trouble , there are major problems inherent in the system .
one such problem , highlighted by teachers ' recent complaints about the militarization of the classroom , is that the ccf becomes a subtle recruitment tool for the armed services , presenting only the positive aspects of a life in the military and ignoring more important ethical issues .
i myself came very close to seeking an raf commission to pay me through medical school , which would have been a 12 year commitment .
this is a decision that i now realise would have been impossible to make at such a young age .
stricter emphasis must be placed on the seriousness of a career in the military -lrb- it is not a decision to be taken lightly at the age of 17 , even though this is many people 's experience -rrb- ; there should be more control over how the ccf interacts with the rest of the school community ; and there should be at the very least some attention to the ethical consequences of using military force in combat .

cadets is a voluntary activity for most kids now , whereas for us there was no choice , and i think that a lot of teenagers would quit when the going got tough .
make it mandatory , and bring back national service !

matthew , uk as a cadet services instructor of some years i know that what this young man says to be true , however , the value of what we do is gradually being eroded by the politically correct and mindless application of petty h & s rules all of which is reducing the quality and authenticity on the training we can provide. for instance there is a strong undercurrent in my service to prevent cadets shooting and it is now very difficult to arrange range time for them because ' guns are not politically correct ' also we are now specifically barred from ordering press-ups as a punishment unless we are ' qualified ' ptis and we are not supposed to shout at them even though sometimes you must for safety reasons .
on the subject of discipline , it is very noticeable that the cadets who are sent ' to get some discipline ' and receive none at home do not do well as the ca n't understand why they are not allowed to freely interpret their orders so this young man must have had a parental base on which to build as do all the cadets peter , worthing uk having been a former cadet warrant officer in the raf section of the ccf , my opinion of the ccf is more ambivalent than shaun bailey 's .
although the discipline and focus demanded really can transform negative attitudes and keep kids out of trouble , there are major problems inherent in the system .
one such problem , highlighted by teachers ' recent complaints about the militarization of the classroom , is that the ccf becomes a subtle recruitment tool for the armed services , presenting only the positive aspects of a life in the military and ignoring more important ethical issues .
i myself came very close to seeking an raf commission to pay me through medical school , which would have been a 12 year commitment .
this is a decision that i now realise would have been impossible to make at such a young age .
stricter emphasis must be placed on the seriousness of a career in the military -lrb- it is not a decision to be taken lightly at the age of 17 , even though this is many people 's experience -rrb- ; there should be more control over how the ccf interacts with the rest of the school community ; and there should be at the very least some attention to the ethical consequences of using military force in combat .
luke martin , oxford i went to a military boarding school in kent , and the morals , discipline and manners that it taught my peers and me were invaluable .
we learned to respect authority the hard way , and we were n't pandered to in any way .
the military tradition , including cadets , was an integral part of our education .
looking at my school friends now , there are none that i know of that have trodden a wayward path in life .
i do think there was also a distinct advantage in that we were all boarders , and the staff had total control over our free time .
detention was n't half an hour after school , it was an hour on a saturday night when all your mates were doing their own thing !
cadets is a voluntary activity for most kids now , whereas for us there was no choice , and i think that a lot of teenagers would quit when the going got tough .
make it mandatory , and bring back national service !
f , notts whilst i appreciate the difference between joining the cadets and the regular army , does this move not fly in the face of recent decisions by schools to stop the army recruiting from within them ?
surely the benefits to young men with a career in the regular army can be just as tangible as those provided by the cadets ?
simon reynolds , milton keynes i am an adult volunteer with the air cadets and a former air cadet myself and it 's true that being a cadet makes a massive difference to the lives of many young people .
i would like to stress that it is n't just for boys and it certainly is n't just for those who have behavioural problems - every youngster can benefit and often those who are quite shy and quiet find a way to express themselves and flourish once wearing a uniform and participating in such exciting activities .
i would encourage all parents to take their sons and daughters along to their local cadet unit -lrb- not in schools but in your local community -rrb- and have a look - it 's very cheap and very exciting - and do n't tell the kids but it 's hugely educational too ! !
paula , stowmarket , suffolk i have been youth leader for 43 years in the boys ' brigade and currently in the air training corps .
the experience of shaun bailey is not unusual .
the discipline in uniformed organisations , sets boundaries of behaviour , enables young people to earn respect , take on responsibility .
it does not really matter which organisation , but all children should be encouraged to join one of them - it will be the making of them !
alan rashleigh , poynton , cheshire , uk i was an air cadet for four yrs and loved every moment .
i did n't join because i was a teenager going off the rails , i joined because i was thinking of joining the raf and wanted some direction to my life .
i loved how smart everyone looked in their blue / grey uniforms and the air of discipline in the sqdrn building .
joining the atc opened up so many opportunities any other kid on the street would n't have .
i learned to play an instrument in the band , i loved drill and competed at a regional level , i competed in the annual sports days , i took rifle practice , had radio training and piloted a light aircraft and that was just for starters !
i even gained the bronze and silver duke of edinburgh awards .
if i could turn back time , i would do it all again and more - i was an extremely proud cadet , the sense of pride when we all did something or won something as a team - a squadron was immense .
vicky prince , oldham i have been in the air training corps for just over three years now and plan to stay as long as i can in the corps .
and it has kept me on the right path through life - this is a great idea , although i think that it would be much better for there to be a greater publicity for the air training corps to get people to join that organisation - it gives you great skills for life and it is what employers love .
i do n't recall the ccf doing many helpful things which encompass all of the cadet forces , however , i know that the atc has a huge list of activities available - from fieldcraft to shooting , from flying to parachuting - there 's something for everyone .
luke carter , coventry i was in the army section of combined cadets at school and i had an immense amount of fun for four years .
a lot of people think it is a recruitment tool for the armed services but i never once encountered a situation where i felt i was being press-ganged into the army .
although national service is against many people 's taste , why not have that alongside government sponsored community projects as an alternative - so long as everybody does something , everybody wins .
james battersby , west molesey , surrey , uk i joined the cadets at 13 and ended up in the ta as an officer .
i am now 32 .
i think that we need some military discipline back in society .
being taught you are not the biggest and hardest .
we need to show those carrying guns or knives on the streets that without them they are not ' big men ' .
i do not understand teachers saying they do n't want this when it might just stop attacks on them and breed some respect .
andy , dubai , uae at the age of 11 , i joined the cadets - but it was st john ambulance cadets in my case .
in a similar way to the combined cadet force , st john ambulance allowed me to develop a sense of pride and self-discipline .
trips to camp taught me that in society , everyone needs to play their part , because on camp , everyone helped with the cleaning , washing and tidying .
if you did n't help , you lost the respect of your peers .
being a cadet with st john ambulance has been the biggest factor in getting my job today , where i work for st john ambulance recruiting volunteer youth leaders to ensure our cadet groups can continue to run .

youth worker shaun bailey explains how 15 years as a cadet kept him out of prison and made him who he is today .
when 12-year-old shaun bailey walked on to a west london council estate to join the army cadets - pretending he was 13 - he was by his own admission " gobby " and aggressive .
his mother was concerned he was falling into the wrong crowd and sent him off to 204 cadet company in white city , a 20-minute walk from the family home .
he now believes her decision was the making of him .
" cadets steered me away from crime and gave me an internal personal pride , " says bailey , now 36 and running a youth charity in the streets where he grew up .
when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it shaun bailey -lrb- pictured today -rrb- " it taught me how to succeed , which is key .
living on your estate , success is beating people up or making money by hustling . "
his motives on that first day were not aligned with his mother 's - he just wanted to be " rock hard " like a para and show off a " cool " uniform on the estate .
two evenings a week plus one weekend session were spent on activities such as shooting , adventure training , map reading , drill training or sports like football , athletics , rugby and gymnastics .
two weekends a month were spent on camp .
" it was very ' boys own ' - we went out and did stuff .
annual camp was the highlight of my life from the age of 13 to 25 , it was two weeks in the summer but i would start saving my money three to four months before . "
shaun 's key lessons taking orders from adults putting group above individual taking responsibility for others getting super-fit making lifelong friends learning about war although the unit 's 600-odd cadets were drawn from the local area , it was a bit of a " white boy " thing at the start , he says , but as time went by the recruits became more diverse .
" joining cadets was the point when i was starting to become different and my mates -lsb- on the estate -rsb- noticed it .
i was always asking them to join but they said they could n't stand having someone shouting at them .
" but you have to take orders , you have to be told stuff by adults and i carried that through to when i went home or when i went to school . "
ironed bedclothes once a youngster accepts discipline from an adult , then the rest of his life becomes easier , and the men giving orders to the cadets instantly earned respect .
" when a big , hard man tells you to shut your mouth , you do it .
but if a schoolteacher does that , the kid will jump up and talk about suing . "
cadets are taught that breaking a rule has consequences , says bailey , and his habit of using his fists to resolve conflict earned him a lot of press-ups when he first joined .
other punishments , for late timekeeping , dirty uniform or messing around , included the deprivation of rewards or blocked promotion .
combined cadet force a voluntary youth organisation for 13 to 18-year-olds it is not part of the armed forces there are 253 units in state and private schools many more units are based in communities began in the 1850s when some schools formed units attached to rifle volunteer battalions bailey says he became so dedicated to the rules and regulations that with a prize on offer for the cleanest room when on camp , he boot-polished his heater to make it less grubby-looking and slept on the floor because he had ironed his bedclothes .
" in the long-term it taught me to invest in myself .
i wanted to win -lsb- the tv show -rsb- superstars so i trained to do it .
i wanted to be promoted so i learnt to map-read , even though at the time , it was boring and hard .
" on the streets , most pay-offs are immediate or you do n't bother with them .
" a problem is getting young people to engage in something that wo n't pay off .
but sometimes you have to just hang on in there . "
aged 17 he was tempted to join the army but decided to focus his energy into helping wayward youngsters in his community .
he continued in the cadets for another 10 years as a sergeant instructor .
tim connolly , who was bailey 's captain when he joined , recalls a boy who needed direction .
" i think he got out of the cadets things he was n't getting out of schooling .
we saw him mature and he became a very able young man . "
but not everyone believes the army is a positive influence on young people .
teachers have opposed the forces recruiting in schools because they fear the classroom being militarised .
bailey disagrees and thinks its influence on young people is all positive .
the answer to youth crime ?
his experience made him realise how futile war is , he says , because a trip to arnhem aged 16 , to meet veterans and see the graves , enabled him to see beyond the hollywood version of the battlefield .
and far from fetishising guns , he says handling a rifle has generated a " loathing " in him for firearms .
unfortunately for some of his early friends , violence was their undoing .
a few got into trouble and were jailed and some even lost their lives .
bailey recalls one particular night when if he had n't been at cadets he would have joined his friends in burgling a factory , a misadventure that led to them all being arrested .
" i sometimes think that the problems that led them down that alley , the skills i learnt in cadets could have saved them .
" when i try to make sense of why i am who i am and why they are who they are , i ca n't escape the fact i was a cadet .
it was absolutely vital . "
below is a selection of your comments : i do not believe that expansion of the ccf is the way forward .
i was once a cadet with the air training corps in grays , essex - not affiliated in any way with a school .
there are many of these squadrons / units across the country and it is these that require the most support .
the ccf can draw from the schools ' ranks ' at the end of the day - a normal atc , army cadet or sea cadet unit needs to recruit from the streets which , apart from joining up , is the toughest task they face .
david neve , lincoln , england i was in the cadets at school and i agree with a lot of the article - it gave me confidence ; the realisation of the futility of war ; how dangerous a rifle or pistol really is ; and to take pride in what i do .
but i also encountered ncos -lrb- essentially older pupils -rrb- who abused their positions of authority .
now anyone who wants my respect must earn it .
just shouting at me to do something is not going to get a reaction , but telling me a valid reason why i must do what they say will .
in the end , i too did n't join the armed forces for that very reason - that i could n't accept orders blindly without being given a valid reason .

in a message to jurors , princes william and harry said : " we agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful . "
the inquest found princess diana and dodi al fayed were unlawfully killed due to the " gross negligence " of driver henri paul and the paparazzi .
but mr al fayed 's father mohamed has refused to accept the verdicts .
the princes thanked the jury " for the forbearance they have shown in accepting such significant disruption to their lives over the past six months " .
' profound gratitude ' they also commended coroner lord justice scott baker for " his unfailing courtesy and for all the consideration shown by him and his staff not only to us but to all those involved in this hearing " .
they added : " we are particularly grateful to trevor rees and to others who came forward to give evidence - in many cases reawakening their painful and personal memories . "
i think he is going to be very mindful of what people are saying - which is that it should end here " katharine witty al fayed spokeswoman " finally , the two of us would like to express our most profound gratitude to all those who fought so desperately to save our mother 's life on that tragic night . "
the jury of six women and five men returned joint verdicts of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving - or gross negligence manslaughter , by a majorities of nine to two .
the inquest into the 1997 paris crash that killed the couple and mr paul lasted six months .
full ramifications the total cost to british taxpayers of investigating princess diana 's death is expected to exceed £ 10m .
but mohamed al fayed has rejected the verdicts .
his spokeswoman katharine witty told bbc news 24 : " i think he is just going to reflect on the full ramifications of the verdict . "
asked if he would challenge it through judicial review , she said : " i think it is something he is considering ... i think he is going to be very mindful of what people are saying - which is that it should end here . "
she said mr al fayed accepted some issues had " fallen away " during the inquest , but added : " it is possible that mi6 were involved ... we are still saying that , it 's possible , but whether ... we can do anything about that remains to be seen . "
' waste of money ' in a statement issued immediately after the jury 's decision , mr al fayed said the verdicts would come as a blow to " millions " of his supporters around the world .
he also insisted the hearing , held largely at his behest , had not been a waste of time or money .
have your say " i hope for the sake of her family , this can finally be laid to rest " mel , england send us your comments this was not the opinion held by many of those who answered a bbc newsnight poll on the subject .
the survey of 1,000 people found 78 % thought the estimated £ 10m bill had not been well spent and 62 % thought the princess 's death was a tragic accident .
despite the verdicts , the ministry of justice has confirmed it is not possible for the crown prosecution service to prosecute foreign nationals for deaths abroad , even if the victim is british .
all of the paparazzi involved were foreign .
' playing with fire ' phil hall , news of the world editor at the time of the crash , said everyone must take responsibility for the tragedy , including the public which had " a voracious appetite " for photos of the couple .
but princess diana was " playing with fire " by courting the press , he told bbc radio 5 live , adding : " where it goes wrong is when you have photographers acting as a mob and a driver who clearly is drunk . "
meanwhile , princess diana 's former butler , paul burrell , is waiting to discover whether he will be investigated by the police for perjury for allegedly lying at the inquest .
scotland yard has so far refused to confirm whether there will be an inquiry , but the crown prosecution service said if the police gave them a file on the matter , they would investigate it .

in a message to jurors , princes william and harry said : " we agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful . "
the inquest found princess diana and dodi al fayed were unlawfully killed due to the " gross negligence " of driver henri paul and the paparazzi .
but mr al fayed 's father mohamed has refused to accept the verdicts .
the princes thanked the jury " for the forbearance they have shown in accepting such significant disruption to their lives over the past six months " .
' profound gratitude ' they also commended coroner lord justice scott baker for " his unfailing courtesy and for all the consideration shown by him and his staff not only to us but to all those involved in this hearing " .
they added : " we are particularly grateful to trevor rees and to others who came forward to give evidence - in many cases reawakening their painful and personal memories .
i think he is going to be very mindful of what people are saying - which is that it should end here katharine witty al fayed spokeswoman " finally , the two of us would like to express our most profound gratitude to all those who fought so desperately to save our mother 's life on that tragic night . "
the jury of six women and five men returned joint verdicts of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving - or gross negligence manslaughter , by a majorities of nine to two .
the inquest into the 1997 paris crash that killed the couple and mr paul lasted six months .
full ramifications the total cost to british taxpayers of investigating princess diana 's death is expected to exceed £ 10m .
but mohamed al fayed has rejected the verdicts .
his spokeswoman katharine witty told bbc news 24 : " i think he is just going to reflect on the full ramifications of the verdict . "
princes harry and william have expressed their gratitude to the jurors asked if he would challenge it through judicial review , she said : " i think it is something he is considering ... i think he is going to be very mindful of what people are saying - which is that it should end here . "
she said mr al fayed accepted some issues had " fallen away " during the inquest , but added : " it is possible that mi6 were involved ... we are still saying that , it 's possible , but whether ... we can do anything about that remains to be seen . "
' waste of money ' in a statement issued immediately after the jury 's decision , mr al fayed said the verdicts would come as a blow to " millions " of his supporters around the world .
he also insisted the hearing , held largely at his behest , had not been a waste of time or money .
have your say i hope for the sake of her family , this can finally be laid to rest mel , england send us your comments this was not the opinion held by many of those who answered a bbc newsnight poll on the subject .
the survey of 1,000 people found 78 % thought the estimated £ 10m bill had not been well spent and 62 % thought the princess 's death was a tragic accident .
despite the verdicts , the ministry of justice has confirmed it is not possible for the crown prosecution service to prosecute foreign nationals for deaths abroad , even if the victim is british .
all of the paparazzi involved were foreign .
' playing with fire ' phil hall , news of the world editor at the time of the crash , said everyone must take responsibility for the tragedy , including the public which had " a voracious appetite " for photos of the couple .
but princess diana was " playing with fire " by courting the press , he told bbc radio 5 live , adding : " where it goes wrong is when you have photographers acting as a mob and a driver who clearly is drunk . "
meanwhile , princess diana 's former butler , paul burrell , is waiting to discover whether he will be investigated by the police for perjury for allegedly lying at the inquest .
scotland yard has so far refused to confirm whether there will be an inquiry , but the crown prosecution service said if the police gave them a file on the matter , they would investigate it .

the inquest found princess diana and dodi al fayed were unlawfully killed due to the " gross negligence " of driver henri paul and the paparazzi .
but mr al fayed 's father mohamed has refused to accept the verdicts .
the princes thanked the jury " for the forbearance they have shown in accepting such significant disruption to their lives over the past six months " .
' profound gratitude ' they also commended coroner lord justice scott baker for " his unfailing courtesy and for all the consideration shown by him and his staff not only to us but to all those involved in this hearing " .
they added : " we are particularly grateful to trevor rees and to others who came forward to give evidence - in many cases reawakening their painful and personal memories .
i think he is going to be very mindful of what people are saying - which is that it should end here katharine witty al fayed spokeswoman " finally , the two of us would like to express our most profound gratitude to all those who fought so desperately to save our mother 's life on that tragic night . "
the jury of six women and five men returned joint verdicts of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving - or gross negligence manslaughter , by a majorities of nine to two .
the inquest into the 1997 paris crash that killed the couple and mr paul lasted six months .
full ramifications the total cost to british taxpayers of investigating princess diana 's death is expected to exceed £ 10m .
but mohamed al fayed has rejected the verdicts .
his spokeswoman katharine witty told bbc news 24 : " i think he is just going to reflect on the full ramifications of the verdict . "
princes harry and william have expressed their gratitude to the jurors asked if he would challenge it through judicial review , she said : " i think it is something he is considering ... i think he is going to be very mindful of what people are saying - which is that it should end here . "
she said mr al fayed accepted some issues had " fallen away " during the inquest , but added : " it is possible that mi6 were involved ... we are still saying that , it 's possible , but whether ... we can do anything about that remains to be seen . "
' waste of money ' in a statement issued immediately after the jury 's decision , mr al fayed said the verdicts would come as a blow to " millions " of his supporters around the world .
he also insisted the hearing , held largely at his behest , had not been a waste of time or money .
have your say i hope for the sake of her family , this can finally be laid to rest mel , england send us your comments this was not the opinion held by many of those who answered a bbc newsnight poll on the subject .
the survey of 1,000 people found 78 % thought the estimated £ 10m bill had not been well spent and 62 % thought the princess 's death was a tragic accident .
despite the verdicts , the ministry of justice has confirmed it is not possible for the crown prosecution service to prosecute foreign nationals for deaths abroad , even if the victim is british .
all of the paparazzi involved were foreign .
' playing with fire ' phil hall , news of the world editor at the time of the crash , said everyone must take responsibility for the tragedy , including the public which had " a voracious appetite " for photos of the couple .
but princess diana was " playing with fire " by courting the press , he told bbc radio 5 live , adding : " where it goes wrong is when you have photographers acting as a mob and a driver who clearly is drunk . "
meanwhile , princess diana 's former butler , paul burrell , is waiting to discover whether he will be investigated by the police for perjury for allegedly lying at the inquest .
scotland yard has so far refused to confirm whether there will be an inquiry , but the crown prosecution service said if the police gave them a file on the matter , they would investigate it .

the 39-year-old singer , who announced she had the illness in 2005 , was speaking on ellen degeneres ' chat show .
" because someone is in a white coat and using big medical instruments does n't necessarily mean they 're right , " said the australian star .
minogue added she continued with her showgirl tour having seen a doctor who told her she was perfectly healthy .
the star said she had heard stories from other women who had been to see a doctor for a diagnosis and were told things were fine .
' intuition ' " i do n't want to say that to frighten people but that 's just a fact , " said minogue .
degeneres revealed she had had a lumpectomy after finding a lump in her breast .
" i had just had a mammogram and they did n't find anything and a couple of weeks later i found a lump , " she said .
in a warning to other women minogue said : " you must follow your intuition and if you have any doubt go back again " .
last year she revealed how her " anger " at having cancer helped energise her in the recording studio once she completed her treatment .
soon after minogue 's diagnosis experts reported an increase of breast cancer awareness amongst women .
her new album , x which was released last year , reached number four in the uk top 40 .

the 80m -lrb- 262ft -rrb- crane , one of the largest in europe , will lay foundations five miles off rhyl , denbighshire .
strong winds had forced experts to steer it into sheltered waters off criccieth on sunday .
the svanen will sink foundations into the sea bed so that 25 offshore wind turbines can be built .
the svanen , which should be visible from the shore , was heading for a site off rhyl when it was diverted on sunday .
the crane has finally been fixed in place at the eastern end of constable bank .
it started its journey from the dutch city of rotterdam on 31 march .
the crane could easily be seen from the shore on sunday project manager gareth penhale said : " the restart of the main offshore construction works is a key milestone in the delivery of this significant renewable energy project .
" once operational , rhyl flats offshore wind farm will generate enough power to meet the annual electricity needs of around 61,000 homes . "
he said the power generation would prevent the release tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide every year .
timetable permission for main offshore works between 1 april and 30 september has been granted with certain works extending to mid-december .
the work timetable is designed to avoid disturbance to a protected bird species , the common scoter .
work is being allowed at night to meet the deadline - but mr penhale said it would be kept to a minimum .
he added : " we are working closely with local environmental health officers to ensure that we do all we can to keep the noise to a minimum , and do not exceed the limits outlined in the consent conditions . "
about 140 employees will work on the construction project until september .
the rhyl project is the latest windfarm scheme in the area .
the north hoyle windfarm , with 30 wind turbines standing more than 40m -lrb- 131ft -rrb- high off the coast of prestatyn , is already operating after work began there in 2003 .

such difficulties are faced by up to a quarter of people who have suffered a stroke .
some people find their language skills improve over time but some may never recover , even with speech therapy .
now researchers at imperial college london are hoping to improve rehabilitation by having a rethink about how the brain recovers .
imaging brain imaging studies they have carried out in stroke patients and healthy individuals have highlighted that speech therapy may have , until now , be focusing on the wrong bit of the brain .
dr jane warren , a neurologist at imperial has found that the development of new pathways between the right and left side of the brain may be the key .
" most other studies have looked at individual brain regions but in our study we looked at how brain regions talk to each other , " she said .
hopefully research like this will give us more understanding of the brain - it 's such a complicated organ and sometimes what we can do now is relatively superficial rosemary cunningham , speech and language therapist " it was thought that that recovery must happen because a certain brain region comes back on line but actually it 's about different regions of the brain talking to each other . "

the team , funded by action medical research , are now using the findings to develop new rehabilitation techniques in patients with language problems which encourage these pathways to form .

she explained currently therapists can either help people to compensate for their problems or try and rehabilitate the part of the brain affected .
" we try and tease out the pathway that 's affected - is it semantics or extracting the right sounds .
" hopefully research like this will give us more understanding of the brain - it 's such a complicated organ and sometimes what we can do now is relatively superficial . "
she added : " the left hemisphere for most people is the language area but it does n't seem that works in isolation so maybe if we can strengthen the connections we can bypass the damaged area . "

" naftagate " may be an exception .
for those who missed it , the term " naftagate " was coined last month by hillary clinton 's communications director , howard wolfson .
it refers to an apparent case of double standards in the obama camp ; the allegation that the illinois senator 's top economics adviser told the canadian government that the campaign 's tough talk on the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- would not translate into tough action once president obama was installed in the white house .
last week , the clinton camp sent out an e-mail , asking fresh questions about the affair .
it is hardly surprising , then , that the news that hillary clinton 's chief strategist , mark penn , had been acting as a cheerleader for a trade treaty with colombia - a deal which she publicly opposes - was so damaging .
it was n't just the conflict of interest , but the subject of the strategist 's moonlighting which made it such an offence ; an act of hubris , which resulted in the long-time clinton adviser 's removal from the front line of her campaign .
job losses the pennsylvania primary on 22 april approaches amid deepening economic uncertainty in the country .
nafta facts started on 1 jan 1994 , full implementation 1 jan 2008 allows free trade between us , canada and mexico side agreements regulate environment , labour critics say 1m us manufacturing jobs have been lost last week , it was announced that 80,000 american jobs were lost in march - the highest monthly figure for five years .
it is the context in which both senators obama and clinton are pledging not to reject free trade but to temper aspects of treaties , such as nafta , which - according to them - hurt american interests and cost americans jobs .
whatever the practical challenges of trying to renegotiate nafta , or , indeed , the truth of its negative impact on the us economy , criticism of free trade seems to strike a particular chord in blue collar , rust belt states , such as pennsylvania and ohio , which have been shedding manufacturing jobs over the past few years .
it is no coincidence that the clinton campaign 's howard wolfson used the term " naftagate " in the run up to last month 's ohio primary , which was eventually won convincingly by the former first lady .
with her rival gradually accumulating pledges of support from the super delegates - the members of the party hierarchy who look set to decide the outcome of the nomination race - she badly needs a similar result in pennsylvania .
her team will be anxiously studying the opinion polls over the next few days , to see what effect - if any - the mark penn controversy has had on those working class voters , on whom she is depending for victory .
real choice for the obama team , it is an unexpected opening ; one which , they hope , could help them pull off a major upset on 22 april .
on the republican side , it is a different story .
the party 's presumptive nominee for president , senator john mccain , is an enthusiastic supporter of free trade and echoes president bush 's traditionally conservative view on the subject .
he will be pleased that , a day after mr penn resigned , mr bush issued a challenge to congress , which is controlled by the democrats , by sending the colombian treaty to capitol hill for ratification .
whichever democratic candidate eventually secures the party 's nomination , then , americans will have a real choice on trade policy in november 's general election .
trade was n't always such a partisan issue , of course .
it was , after all , president bill clinton who signed nafta into law in 1993 - despite what the clinton campaign insists was the lukewarm support of his wife .
support which appears to be growing cooler by the day .
