czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .

the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .

the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
he was party chairman in 2004-05 . a return to schroeder 's program steinmeier , who took over as deputy chancellor under christian democrat chancellor merkel , is seen as on the right of the spd . as a close confidant and chief of staff to merkel 's predecessor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder , he is closely associated with schroeder 's agenda 2010 economic reform program that is rejected by many on the spd 's left wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering returns as party chairman steinmeier 's nomination to lead the party into the sept .
27 elections next year comes at a time when the spd , the traditional party of the german left , has slumped at the opinion polls .
support for the spd now hovers at around 26 percent , 10 percentage points behind merkel 's conservative camp . challenge from the left since last year , the spd has faced an increasingly strong challenge on the left from the newly formed left party , which has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states . following his wife 's death , muentefering signaled his comeback last week with a rousing speech to spd members in munich , ahead of elections in the southern state of bavaria at the end of this month . another close schroeder associate , he made clear his backing for the agenda 2010 program in his address , calling on spd members to be proud of the program 's achievements in cutting unemployment and blancing a budget deficit by 2011 . on saturday , merkel lashed out at the spd , the junior partner in her grand coalition government , calling the party " unreliable . "
the chancellor said she hoped the cdu / csu will be able to form a coalition with the minority liberal fdp following the next elections . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this caucasian crisis wo n't be resolved if there is not an intense collaboration - that europe wishes for , that the united states wishes for , and we will carry out , " italian foreign minister franco frattini told reporters on sunday , sept .
7 , following brief talks with cheney . frattini also said he had informed the us vice president of the eu 's plan to send civilian observers to the disputed territory in the caucasus region to help enforce the french-brokered peace deal agreed by tbilisi and moscow . at an informal meeting in southern france on saturday , eu foreign ministers laid out plans for the bloc 's observer mission , which could begin as early as next month .
they also called for an international probe into the cause of the five-day war . moscow maintains adherence to accord both the us and europe have insisted that russia pull its troops out of georgia , as outlined in the ceasefire accord worked out last month by french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2008 maltese anger mounts over rising illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the eu , immigrants can only apply for refugee status in the first country they enter even as eu border patrols search for some 70 migrants who went missing near malta on aug .
27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
he was party chairman in 2004-05 . a return to schroeder 's program steinmeier , who took over as deputy chancellor under christian democrat chancellor merkel , is seen as on the right of the spd . as a close confidant and chief of staff to merkel 's predecessor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder , he is closely associated with schroeder 's agenda 2010 economic reform program that is rejected by many on the spd 's left wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering returns as party chairman steinmeier 's nomination to lead the party into the sept .
27 elections next year comes at a time when the spd , the traditional party of the german left , has slumped at the opinion polls .
support for the spd now hovers at around 26 percent , 10 percentage points behind merkel 's conservative camp . challenge from the left since last year , the spd has faced an increasingly strong challenge on the left from the newly formed left party , which has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states . following his wife 's death , muentefering signaled his comeback last week with a rousing speech to spd members in munich , ahead of elections in the southern state of bavaria at the end of this month . another close schroeder associate , he made clear his backing for the agenda 2010 program in his address , calling on spd members to be proud of the program 's achievements in cutting unemployment and blancing a budget deficit by 2011 . on saturday , merkel lashed out at the spd , the junior partner in her grand coalition government , calling the party " unreliable . "
the chancellor said she hoped the cdu / csu will be able to form a coalition with the minority liberal fdp following the next elections . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 07.09.2008 report : steinmeier to run for chancellor next year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier enjoys high popularity ratings germany 's social democrats meet sunday amidst a deep leadership crisis .
but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2008 maltese anger mounts over rising illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the eu , immigrants can only apply for refugee status in the first country they enter even as eu border patrols search for some 70 migrants who went missing near malta on aug .
27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .

he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
he was party chairman in 2004-05 . a return to schroeder 's program steinmeier , who took over as deputy chancellor under christian democrat chancellor merkel , is seen as on the right of the spd . as a close confidant and chief of staff to merkel 's predecessor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder , he is closely associated with schroeder 's agenda 2010 economic reform program that is rejected by many on the spd 's left wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering returns as party chairman steinmeier 's nomination to lead the party into the sept .
27 elections next year comes at a time when the spd , the traditional party of the german left , has slumped at the opinion polls .
support for the spd now hovers at around 26 percent , 10 percentage points behind merkel 's conservative camp . challenge from the left since last year , the spd has faced an increasingly strong challenge on the left from the newly formed left party , which has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states . following his wife 's death , muentefering signaled his comeback last week with a rousing speech to spd members in munich , ahead of elections in the southern state of bavaria at the end of this month . another close schroeder associate , he made clear his backing for the agenda 2010 program in his address , calling on spd members to be proud of the program 's achievements in cutting unemployment and blancing a budget deficit by 2011 . on saturday , merkel lashed out at the spd , the junior partner in her grand coalition government , calling the party " unreliable .

the chancellor said she hoped the cdu / csu will be able to form a coalition with the minority liberal fdp following the next elections . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , but hit five goals after the break to warm up for a more difficult trip wednesday to finland .
germany had scored 17 goals in their only two previous meetings against the principality , winning 9-1 in 1996 and 8-2 in 2000 , but for a long time liechtenstein proved stubborn opponents .
lukas podolski fired german ahead in the 21st minute with a crisp left-foot shot after a neat exchange of passes with piotr trochowski but it was all germany had to show for first-half possession .
trochowski had seen a shot saved by goalkeeper peter jehle in the fourth minute and miroslav klose should have scored a second for joachim loew 's side but sidefooted the ball past jehle and the post .
but podolski added a second - and his 30th for germany - three minutes after the break after trochowski was again the provider , and the floodgates gradually began to open .
the bayern munich striker almost scored a third when he blasted the ball over the bar from close range , but simon rolfes and bastian schweinsteiger scored in the 65th and 66th minutes .
thomas hitzlsperger added a fifth 10 minutes later and defender heiko westermann made it six four minutes from time as the match turned into a stroll for joachim loew 's side . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
he was party chairman in 2004-05 . a return to schroeder 's program steinmeier , who took over as deputy chancellor under christian democrat chancellor merkel , is seen as on the right of the spd . as a close confidant and chief of staff to merkel 's predecessor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder , he is closely associated with schroeder 's agenda 2010 economic reform program that is rejected by many on the spd 's left wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering returns as party chairman steinmeier 's nomination to lead the party into the sept .
27 elections next year comes at a time when the spd , the traditional party of the german left , has slumped at the opinion polls .
support for the spd now hovers at around 26 percent , 10 percentage points behind merkel 's conservative camp . challenge from the left since last year , the spd has faced an increasingly strong challenge on the left from the newly formed left party , which has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states . following his wife 's death , muentefering signaled his comeback last week with a rousing speech to spd members in munich , ahead of elections in the southern state of bavaria at the end of this month . another close schroeder associate , he made clear his backing for the agenda 2010 program in his address , calling on spd members to be proud of the program 's achievements in cutting unemployment and blancing a budget deficit by 2011 . on saturday , merkel lashed out at the spd , the junior partner in her grand coalition government , calling the party " unreliable . "
the chancellor said she hoped the cdu / csu will be able to form a coalition with the minority liberal fdp following the next elections . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , but hit five goals after the break to warm up for a more difficult trip wednesday to finland .
germany had scored 17 goals in their only two previous meetings against the principality , winning 9-1 in 1996 and 8-2 in 2000 , but for a long time liechtenstein proved stubborn opponents .
lukas podolski fired german ahead in the 21st minute with a crisp left-foot shot after a neat exchange of passes with piotr trochowski but it was all germany had to show for first-half possession .
trochowski had seen a shot saved by goalkeeper peter jehle in the fourth minute and miroslav klose should have scored a second for joachim loew 's side but sidefooted the ball past jehle and the post .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , but hit five goals after the break to warm up for a more difficult trip wednesday to finland .
germany had scored 17 goals in their only two previous meetings against the principality , winning 9-1 in 1996 and 8-2 in 2000 , but for a long time liechtenstein proved stubborn opponents .
lukas podolski fired german ahead in the 21st minute with a crisp left-foot shot after a neat exchange of passes with piotr trochowski but it was all germany had to show for first-half possession .
trochowski had seen a shot saved by goalkeeper peter jehle in the fourth minute and miroslav klose should have scored a second for joachim loew 's side but sidefooted the ball past jehle and the post .
but podolski added a second - and his 30th for germany - three minutes after the break after trochowski was again the provider , and the floodgates gradually began to open .
the bayern munich striker almost scored a third when he blasted the ball over the bar from close range , but simon rolfes and bastian schweinsteiger scored in the 65th and 66th minutes .
thomas hitzlsperger added a fifth 10 minutes later and defender heiko westermann made it six four minutes from time as the match turned into a stroll for joachim loew 's side . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany had scored 17 goals in their only two previous meetings against the principality , winning 9-1 in 1996 and 8-2 in 2000 , but for a long time liechtenstein proved stubborn opponents .
lukas podolski fired german ahead in the 21st minute with a crisp left-foot shot after a neat exchange of passes with piotr trochowski but it was all germany had to show for first-half possession .
trochowski had seen a shot saved by goalkeeper peter jehle in the fourth minute and miroslav klose should have scored a second for joachim loew 's side but sidefooted the ball past jehle and the post .
but podolski added a second - and his 30th for germany - three minutes after the break after trochowski was again the provider , and the floodgates gradually began to open .
the bayern munich striker almost scored a third when he blasted the ball over the bar from close range , but simon rolfes and bastian schweinsteiger scored in the 65th and 66th minutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2008 maltese anger mounts over rising illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the eu , immigrants can only apply for refugee status in the first country they enter even as eu border patrols search for some 70 migrants who went missing near malta on aug .
27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this caucasian crisis wo n't be resolved if there is not an intense collaboration - that europe wishes for , that the united states wishes for , and we will carry out , " italian foreign minister franco frattini told reporters on sunday , sept .
7 , following brief talks with cheney . frattini also said he had informed the us vice president of the eu 's plan to send civilian observers to the disputed territory in the caucasus region to help enforce the french-brokered peace deal agreed by tbilisi and moscow . at an informal meeting in southern france on saturday , eu foreign ministers laid out plans for the bloc 's observer mission , which could begin as early as next month .
they also called for an international probe into the cause of the five-day war . moscow maintains adherence to accord both the us and europe have insisted that russia pull its troops out of georgia , as outlined in the ceasefire accord worked out last month by french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
russia has not yet fully complied with the demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has not withdrawn all of its troops from the disputed territory french foreign minister bernard kouchner said saturday from the meeting with his eu counterparts that different interpretations of the peace plan may have arisen due to a translation error . the russian version spoke of security " for south ossetia and abkhazia , " while the english text referred to security " in " the two regions , reported afp news agency . sarkozy is scheduled to go to moscow on monday to clear up any misunderstandings .
he is expected to insist that russia abide by the terms of the agreement . us-russia relations reach post-cold war low tensions between russia and the us intensified saturday when cheney criticized russia of carrying out a " chain of aggressive moves " and accused moscow of reverting to soviet-era tactics .
it was the sharpest statement from washington since the outbreak of the conflict in early august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney promised us aid to tbilisi the vice president 's comments came just a few hours after russian president dmitry medvedev had warned that moscow was " a force to be reckoned with .

support for the spd now hovers at around 26 percent , 10 percentage points behind merkel 's conservative camp . challenge from the left since last year , the spd has faced an increasingly strong challenge on the left from the newly formed left party , which has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states . following his wife 's death , muentefering signaled his comeback last week with a rousing speech to spd members in munich , ahead of elections in the southern state of bavaria at the end of this month . another close schroeder associate , he made clear his backing for the agenda 2010 program in his address , calling on spd members to be proud of the program 's achievements in cutting unemployment and blancing a budget deficit by 2011 . on saturday , merkel lashed out at the spd , the junior partner in her grand coalition government , calling the party " unreliable .

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .

then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .

the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .

czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .

6 , but hit five goals after the break to warm up for a more difficult trip wednesday to finland .
germany had scored 17 goals in their only two previous meetings against the principality , winning 9-1 in 1996 and 8-2 in 2000 , but for a long time liechtenstein proved stubborn opponents .
lukas podolski fired german ahead in the 21st minute with a crisp left-foot shot after a neat exchange of passes with piotr trochowski but it was all germany had to show for first-half possession .
trochowski had seen a shot saved by goalkeeper peter jehle in the fourth minute and miroslav klose should have scored a second for joachim loew 's side but sidefooted the ball past jehle and the post .
but podolski added a second - and his 30th for germany - three minutes after the break after trochowski was again the provider , and the floodgates gradually began to open .
the bayern munich striker almost scored a third when he blasted the ball over the bar from close range , but simon rolfes and bastian schweinsteiger scored in the 65th and 66th minutes .
thomas hitzlsperger added a fifth 10 minutes later and defender heiko westermann made it six four minutes from time as the match turned into a stroll for joachim loew 's side . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .

at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also called for an international probe into the cause of the five-day war . moscow maintains adherence to accord both the us and europe have insisted that russia pull its troops out of georgia , as outlined in the ceasefire accord worked out last month by french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .

i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this caucasian crisis wo n't be resolved if there is not an intense collaboration - that europe wishes for , that the united states wishes for , and we will carry out , " italian foreign minister franco frattini told reporters on sunday , sept .
7 , following brief talks with cheney . frattini also said he had informed the us vice president of the eu 's plan to send civilian observers to the disputed territory in the caucasus region to help enforce the french-brokered peace deal agreed by tbilisi and moscow . at an informal meeting in southern france on saturday , eu foreign ministers laid out plans for the bloc 's observer mission , which could begin as early as next month .
they also called for an international probe into the cause of the five-day war . moscow maintains adherence to accord both the us and europe have insisted that russia pull its troops out of georgia , as outlined in the ceasefire accord worked out last month by french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
russia has not yet fully complied with the demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has not withdrawn all of its troops from the disputed territory french foreign minister bernard kouchner said saturday from the meeting with his eu counterparts that different interpretations of the peace plan may have arisen due to a translation error . the russian version spoke of security " for south ossetia and abkhazia , " while the english text referred to security " in " the two regions , reported afp news agency . sarkozy is scheduled to go to moscow on monday to clear up any misunderstandings .
he is expected to insist that russia abide by the terms of the agreement . us-russia relations reach post-cold war low tensions between russia and the us intensified saturday when cheney criticized russia of carrying out a " chain of aggressive moves " and accused moscow of reverting to soviet-era tactics .

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
he was party chairman in 2004-05 . a return to schroeder 's program steinmeier , who took over as deputy chancellor under christian democrat chancellor merkel , is seen as on the right of the spd . as a close confidant and chief of staff to merkel 's predecessor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder , he is closely associated with schroeder 's agenda 2010 economic reform program that is rejected by many on the spd 's left wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering returns as party chairman steinmeier 's nomination to lead the party into the sept .
27 elections next year comes at a time when the spd , the traditional party of the german left , has slumped at the opinion polls .
support for the spd now hovers at around 26 percent , 10 percentage points behind merkel 's conservative camp . challenge from the left since last year , the spd has faced an increasingly strong challenge on the left from the newly formed left party , which has its main support base in the formerly communist eastern states but has also made strong inroads in western states . following his wife 's death , muentefering signaled his comeback last week with a rousing speech to spd members in munich , ahead of elections in the southern state of bavaria at the end of this month . another close schroeder associate , he made clear his backing for the agenda 2010 program in his address , calling on spd members to be proud of the program 's achievements in cutting unemployment and blancing a budget deficit by 2011 . on saturday , merkel lashed out at the spd , the junior partner in her grand coalition government , calling the party " unreliable . "
the chancellor said she hoped the cdu / csu will be able to form a coalition with the minority liberal fdp following the next elections . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.09.2008 czechs stick it to the eu with sugary video großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweet sarcasm ?
czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .

" the election campaign does not begin today , but we are now in the game of catching up for the 2009 federal election , " steinmeier , 52 , said as he accepted his party 's nomination .
beck 's resignation a surprise the party was better equipped than many believed and was ready for the election campaign , steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck stepped down " we do not want anyone to be marginalized in our society , " he said , signaling that the spd , threatened by the rise of a new far-left party , aims to focus on social issues during the campaign . although it had long been anticipated that beck would yield to steinmeier as the candidate for chancellor , his resignation as spd federal head took observers by surprise . steinmeier regularly tops the polls as the most popular german politician , although he lacks beck 's political credentials within the spd . muentefering , 68 , resigned as deputy chancellor last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
he was party chairman in 2004-05 . a return to schroeder 's program steinmeier , who took over as deputy chancellor under christian democrat chancellor merkel , is seen as on the right of the spd . as a close confidant and chief of staff to merkel 's predecessor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder , he is closely associated with schroeder 's agenda 2010 economic reform program that is rejected by many on the spd 's left wing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering returns as party chairman steinmeier 's nomination to lead the party into the sept .

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .

a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .

czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .

6 , but hit five goals after the break to warm up for a more difficult trip wednesday to finland .
germany had scored 17 goals in their only two previous meetings against the principality , winning 9-1 in 1996 and 8-2 in 2000 , but for a long time liechtenstein proved stubborn opponents .
lukas podolski fired german ahead in the 21st minute with a crisp left-foot shot after a neat exchange of passes with piotr trochowski but it was all germany had to show for first-half possession .
trochowski had seen a shot saved by goalkeeper peter jehle in the fourth minute and miroslav klose should have scored a second for joachim loew 's side but sidefooted the ball past jehle and the post .
but podolski added a second - and his 30th for germany - three minutes after the break after trochowski was again the provider , and the floodgates gradually began to open .
the bayern munich striker almost scored a third when he blasted the ball over the bar from close range , but simon rolfes and bastian schweinsteiger scored in the 65th and 66th minutes .
thomas hitzlsperger added a fifth 10 minutes later and defender heiko westermann made it six four minutes from time as the match turned into a stroll for joachim loew 's side . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this caucasian crisis wo n't be resolved if there is not an intense collaboration - that europe wishes for , that the united states wishes for , and we will carry out , " italian foreign minister franco frattini told reporters on sunday , sept .
7 , following brief talks with cheney . frattini also said he had informed the us vice president of the eu 's plan to send civilian observers to the disputed territory in the caucasus region to help enforce the french-brokered peace deal agreed by tbilisi and moscow . at an informal meeting in southern france on saturday , eu foreign ministers laid out plans for the bloc 's observer mission , which could begin as early as next month .
they also called for an international probe into the cause of the five-day war . moscow maintains adherence to accord both the us and europe have insisted that russia pull its troops out of georgia , as outlined in the ceasefire accord worked out last month by french president nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .

it was the sharpest statement from washington since the outbreak of the conflict in early august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney promised us aid to tbilisi the vice president 's comments came just a few hours after russian president dmitry medvedev had warned that moscow was " a force to be reckoned with .

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .
" europe will certainly get the message . "
so what should europe expect from prague 's sugar cube ?

czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .

a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 07.09.2008 czechs stick it to the eu with sugary video großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweet sarcasm ?
czech president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic , once warned that his nation would dissolve in the european union like a sugar cube in a cup of coffee . now that the czechs are about to chair the european union , the government has turned the cube into a sweetly subversive symbol of its scepticism toward the european union .
the 30-second video , unveiled by prime minister mirek topolanek and his deputy for european affairs alexandr vondra , is meant to draw the public 's attention to the six-month czech presidency starting jan .
1 .
the clip , airing on nationwide television since thursday , says nothing about prague 's agenda for the 27-nation bloc .
a sign of insecurity ?
instead , critics argue , it 's a rebellious yet toothless jab at brussels that gives a telling glimpse into a small nation 's insecurities .
the video shows czech celebrities playing around a conference table with an old czech invention - sugar cubes .
like impatient schoolchildren , they are naughty , bored or absent-minded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalie cech helped make the video to the sound of europe 's anthem , beethoven 's " ode to joy , " ice hockey star jaromir jagr shoots a cube with a spoon to football goalkeeper petr cech .
a ballerina spins one into a pirouette , an architect stacks them up and fashion model tereza maxova gulps one down .
then , in an apparent echo of klaus ' statement , conductor libor pesek drops another cube into a cup of coffee , causing the brown liquid to splash .
" we will make it sweet for europe , " says the punch line . the idiom has a double meaning in czech : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time .
czech ambivalence " it clearly conveys the czech ambivalence toward the eu , " said daniel koppl , editor-in-chief of media and marketing journal .
" we do what the eu wants , but we also show off as grand and brash . "
the small central european nation , squeezed between europe 's western and eastern powers , has learned to swallow bitter pills and to belittle hardship , using humor known for hard-to-police allegories and word plays .
the subversive streak was best captured in the famed czech novel " the good soldier svejk , " a satirical anti-war book by jaroslav hasek published after world war i in the 1920s .
simply put , svejk dodges the habsburg empire 's war machine with idiocy - whether pretended or genuine is up to the reader to decide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus is known as a euro-critic czech officials stressed the video clip 's positive intentions , but hints by vice-premier vondra at the presentation suggested that the publicity campaign is in line with the svejk tradition .
sugar industry left bitter sugar cubes , the czech ammunition during the country 's eu presidency , were invented in 1841 in the southern czech town of dacice by swiss-born businessman jakub krystof rad .
switzerland , of course , is not an eu member .
moreover , the czech republic 's sugar industry was forced to shrink when the country agreed to lower sugar production in its deal to join the eu in 2004 .
more cuts followed with the bloc 's sugar reform .
czech sugar producers say output has fallen by 35 percent compared to pre-eu years . " it 's a paradox , " jan zahorka of the czech agriculture chamber said of the video .
" our entry into the eu ... meant that we turned from a sugar exporter into a sugar importer .
how symbolic . "
sugar industry captains , still upset about the eu quotas , applauded the government for sticking it to brussels .
" i find it funny , like a typical czech , " said oldrich reinbergr , who heads the largest czech sugar refinery , cukrovary ttd as .
" we could have dissolved in europe but instead we will sweeten it up for them , " he mused .

27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .
it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .

it seems as though you 're trying to find a balance in your life between living in istanbul and traveling , between being a political person and being an artist ?
yes , i have to do that .
i 'm not an exile for example , and they try to pigeonhole me as an exile .
" no , " i say , " i 'm not an exile . "
i go outside of turkey by myself , if i want i can live here 365 days a year if i enjoy it .
living in new york during the semesters that i stay there and traveling is a nice thing , but i do n't want to undermine and make a victim of myself .
one reason perhaps is that i come from a culture that was never colonized and never victimized .
i do n't enjoy representing myself as a victim of international powers , nor the victim of a turkish state .
i am on my feet , happy , living , enjoying writing books , and so on .
that is how i look at my life .
and you do n't want to be a bridge builder ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried in turkey for insulting national identity bridge is a cliche imposed on me just because i 'm a turk and of course the first thing everyone says about turkey is that it 's between east and west .
but before being a bridge , you have to understand the humanity of the culture , its shadows , dark places , unreasonable sights , its aspirations , its hopes for the future , its daily moments , its weaknesses , its misery .
my job is to see that before saying " i 'm a bridge " or something like that .
that kind of political representation or agenda - i do n't have that .
i am essentially a literary person , who writes stories .
yes , in my books there is also a philosophical side .
i 'm an essayist , i also make judgments about cultures , politics , but essentially i am a storyteller first , and mainly of stories about people .
and now you are bringing a wonderful new story to the 2008 frankfurt book fair which is called " the museum of innocence . "
it 's a novel about love , a wonderful love story about istanbul of course , and also about museums .
and it 's the first novel in the history of literature , i think , which has its own museum .
yes , " the museum of innocence " chronicles the love story of kemal , an upper-class person , a person who is occasionally described as high-society .
he is 30 years old in 1975 and chronicles his infatuation with a distant relative , a twice removed cousin , fusun , an 18 year-old shop girl , but very beautiful .
as sort of a compensation for his failure to get her hand , he collects everything he can get that fusun touches , and in the end he makes a museum of the objects that their story is associated with .
my " museum of innocence " is a real museum too , which tries to pin down all these objects .
i 've been collecting things for this museum almost for six years .
i bought a house which is actually where this part of the story has been taking place since about ten years ago .
i converted it into a museum so the " museum of innocence " is both a museum and a novel .
the enjoyment of the novel and the enjoyment of the would-be museum are two entirely different things .
the museum is not an illustration of the novel and the novel is not an explanation of the museum .
they are two representations of one single story perhaps .
and when we go to the museum we can relive the story just by touching and seeing the little things that appear in the book .
it 's like a lived memory .
and in the end your hero says that everyone should know that he led a happy life .
are you leading a happy life orhan pamuk ?
i 'm leading a very happy life .
i 'm happy that i 'm addressing readers of 58 languages , millions of readers , that i 'm writing my books from the heart and they are reading whatever i write .
can there be any happier life , i thought when i was 25 , and i decided to stop painting and become a writer .
i think sometimes that all of my fantasies about fame and success - which is more than i expected - are satisfied .
i should confess that i am a happy author . interview : rainer traube -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

looking back over the past two years , has your life as a writer changed ?
orhan pamuk : when i heard about the nobel prize , my first instinctive , strong impulse was to say to my agent who gave me the news that this would not change my life .
i now understand that i was optimistic - it changed my life , but it did not change my working habits .
i 'm still dedicated to my strict discipline of waking up early , writing , keeping up the schedule and so on .
but then , yes , it did change my life .
it made me more famous , it brought me so many new readers and it made it slightly difficult - it made everything i do more political than i 'd expected .
years ago in frankfurt you gave a speech when you received the peace prize of the german book trade and then you were talking about europe and turkey .
you said turkey dreams of europe and europe can not define itself without turkey .
is this an opinion you still hold three years later ?
unfortunately the negotiations in the last few years between europe and turkey have mellowed down a bit .
perhaps this is because of the ultra-rightwing and the establishment and armies blocking off turkey 's road towards the european union .
and also the resistance in european nations : among the conservatives of france and germany , who of course resist turkey becoming a full member .
so the issue is troubled and it is not as sunny as it looked two years ago .
sooner or later i strongly believe that turkey will be an integral part of europe , but now the situation does n't look so good , so it worries me - but it does not make me cry because i am essentially a fiction writer , and if i ever cry , it 's because i am worrying about the beauty of my book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i know what humanity is in istanbul " in spite of the beauty of your books there is a lot of intimidation going on against you and others in turkey from ultra-nationalists or ultra-religious groups .
does that have an effect on your life here and on intellectual life in turkey at the moment ?
yes , of course .
it has an effect on my life , i practically live with bodyguards and living with bodyguards is not a nice thing .
so i 'm worried that again the ultra-rightwing and sometimes established newspapers still continue to attack me , with campaigns against me that worry me .
besides that , because i teach at columbia university one semester per year and now that my books are being published , i like to go to conferences .
i 'm traveling outside turkey and teaching around half or more than half my time unfortunately - or fortunately , whatever .
i 've spent the last two years outside of turkey .
this is perhaps partly related to the nobel prize .
my fame grew and grew , but then i moved back here .
i have witnessed humanity in istanbul .
oh i know what humanity is in istanbul .
i can not think of life without istanbul - with bodyguards in the middle of the night , by myself alone , whatever .
i am still in the streets of istanbul and observing and enjoying it and i 'll continue to write stories about the true istanbul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.09.2008 maltese anger mounts over rising illegal immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the eu , immigrants can only apply for refugee status in the first country they enter even as eu border patrols search for some 70 migrants who went missing near malta on aug .
27 , the people of the smallest eu state are becoming fed up with rising illegal immigration . the 70 disappeared when they were swept off a flimsy craft which capsized after it left libya , according to eight fellow travelers who managed to cling onto the vessel long enough to be rescued .
it is one of the worst tragedies involving would-be immigrants in the mediterranean - yet the maltese newspaper 's online readers ' forum offered little , if any , compassion .
instead , anger was directed at the thousands of africans who attempt to cross the waters to europe .
readers ' rage was also aimed at neighboring libya , from where most of the would-be immigrants depart , and the european union , which is perceived as turning a blind eye towards a mounting problem .
in the past eight months 2,200 would-be illegal immigrants landed on malta , the smallest and most densely-populated european union state .
in contrast less than 1,700 arrivals were recorded for the whole of 2007 .
given malta 's population of 400,000 , it is as if 45,000 people had landed in germany , maltese government officials have said .
the island nation has rescued over 9,000 people off its coast in the past five years .
some were found clinging desperately to tuna farm cages after their boats sank .
many others simply disappeared , adding to the unknown toll of africans who have died in their attempt to find a better life abroad .
despite appeals for solidarity by church officials , newspaper forums on the staunchly catholic island suggest that sentiments of racism run high with many maltese .
malta 's main political parties , afraid of harming their country 's eu credentials , have been coy about the issue .
however , a recent euro survey showed that illegal immigration is the second highest concern among maltese citizens , despite their country signing the united nations ' convention on refugees .
a problem for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees cling to a tuna fishing net after their boat sank the islanders also doubt the political goodwill of other eu states who have responded tepidly to malta 's request for the introduction of " burden-sharing " - whereby other eu members would absorb a number of people certified as refugees .
to date , only germany and the netherlands have accepted a few refugees from malta .
the most substantial contribution has come from the united states , which this year agreed to accept 200 refugees .
" it is necessary for the eu to provide a concrete form of european solidarity , " malta 's home affairs minister , carmelo mifsud bonnici , told dpa news agency .
resettling immigrants within the eu is the only way for the bloc to achieve common standards in dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers , and also share the burden of the influx , according to mifsud bonnici .
it would also ease the situation inside immigrant detention centers where limited resources are already over-stretched , he said .
in addition , the perceived failure of the frontex border patrols has increased maltese skepticism of the eu 's anti-illegal immigration measures .
most of frontex 's equipment , including patrol boats and rescue vessels , are provided by the maltese military , with little support from other eu nations , critics of the operation say .
still , no amount of sea patrols will deter people wanting to flee africa , according to 25-year-old imman ali dirie who fled his conflict-ridden homeland of somalia in 2005 .
trapped on malta " when you lose everything you have in your home , you are determined to move to more prosperous countries , and nobody can convince me to turn back , " said dirie .
dirie is one of the many who tried to reach italy , but was forced to stop in malta because his boat ran out of supplies .
once in malta , immigrants discover their dream of reaching mainland europe remains a dream - under the eu 's dublin regulation they can only apply for refugee status in the first member state they enter .
" in malta you feel trapped .
we all want to leave malta but you ca n't continue with your trip , you do n't want to go back to africa - and the maltese do n't want you here , " dirie said . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .
but those on the left of the spd are scathing about its effects on the marginalized in german society , who have seen their social security benefits slashed .
state exemplary of new party landscape the split in the spd is exemplified in another western state - hesse - where local spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority and koch in power at the head of a caretaker administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party has reshaped germany 's party landscape the 5.1 percent secured by the left , contesting the hesse election for the first time , effectively blocked an spd victory .
ypsilanti backtracked on a campaign pledge not to enter into any kind of cooperative agreement with the left and said she would seek to form a minority government with the greens on the basis of tolerance by the left .
beck flip-flopped on the move , but finally gave it his blessing , only to see it founder on opposition within the spd at state level .
now ypsilanti is set to try again , despite widespread fears within the party that any association with the former communists could prove electoral poison for the spd in next year 's federal elections .
in this divided atmosphere , party chairman beck is under pressure on all sides .
strong support for steinmeier there has been a growing wave of support for frank-walter steinmeier to stand for the chancellorship in september next year .
the foreign minister has the highest approval ratings of any german politician in the polls , surpassing even merkel herself .
but , as schroeder 's chief of staff while in office , the charismatic foreign minister is closely associated with the former chancellor 's policies and would be unlikely to countenance any kind of deal with the left , whether at state or federal level .
steinmeier has another disadvantage .
he has not come up through the party ranks the way beck , who has been premier of rhineland-palatinate since 1994 , has and thus lacks backing within the party establishment .
possible kingmaker returns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering has returned to the german political scene meanwhile , another heavyweight from the schroeder era has returned to the fray - franz muentefering , labor minister in merkel 's cabinet until resigning last year to care for his terminally ill wife .
at a rally of the bavarian spd in munich this week , " muente " signalled his comeback , drawing an ecstatic response from party supporters in the city 's hoffbraeukeller ahead of bavarian state elections at the end of the month .
he explicitly backed schroeder 's agenda 2010 reforms , urging the party to show pride at its achievements and greater self-confidence .
at 68 , muentefering is unlikely to be a direct threat to beck but could prove kingmaker if he throws his weight behind steinmeier . and that in turn could set the spd , germany 's oldest political party , on a course away from any deals with the left . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the party has agreed to announce foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as its candidate for chancellor next year , say media reports . senior leaders in the social democratic pary -lrb- spd -rrb- have decided that steinmeier will run against incumbent chancellor angela merkel in next year 's federal elections , according to reports on saturday , sept .
6 , by the berliner zeitung and spiegel online .
the two web sites reported , without citing sources , that steinmeier 's candidacy would be announced at sunday 's party conference .
though the social democrats appear to have reached one important decision in selecting steinmeier , their meeting comes at a time of deep internal divisions .
widespread dissatisfaction over the leadership of party chairman kurt beck and the zig-zag course he has followed in dealing with the rise of the new socialist left party have alienated many in its traditional support base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has alienated some of the spd 's traditional support base even in beck 's home state of rheinland-palatinate , where the spd has held power since 1991 , voters are swinging to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a poll published friday showed 38 percent of the electorate backing the cdu , against just 36 percent for the spd , which secured 45.6 percent of the vote in the march 2006 state election - a fall of almost 10 percentage points over little more than two years .
rise of the left the dilemma facing the party is illustrated by another poll published this week .
in the small western state of saarland , the traditional party of the left has fallen to 23 percent - behind the left party on 24 percent .
the left has been boosted by the announcement that oskar lafontaine will lead the party in state elections next year .
lafontaine enjoys great popularity in the state , where he was spd premier for 13 years to 1998 .
until this year , the spd had seen itself as immune to threat from this flank , at least in the states of the former west germany - the bulk of post-1990 reunified germany .
split over schroeder 's reforms but the left party , which draws its main support in formerly communist east germany , has bounded ahead in the west as well , attracting disgruntled trade unionists and eating into the spd 's traditional support base .
the spd is bitterly divided over the legacy left it by former chancellor gerhard schroeder when he was voted out of office in september 2005 .
schroeder 's agenda 2010 reform program is widely credited with cutting unemployment by two million over the past three years and with putting the german budget on course towards balance in 2011 .

the new fares are " anytime " - which can be used on any train , at any time ; and " off-peak " which has restrictions on the time and day of travel .
the move comes after a revamp of the advanced tickets structure in may .
watchdog passenger focus has welcomed the new fares , but others say greater changes are needed to the rail network .
" adopting common ticket names is a step in the right direction , " anthony smith , chief executive of passenger focus , told bbc radio five live .
" it does start to hack away at some of the complexity of the fares and the names and for the first time we 've got all the train companies using the same names " .
' different labels ' current ticket types which will be re-named off-peak include saver and cheap day returns .
train operators say they are responding to passenger demand and the new changes will continue to make the system simpler .
michael roberts , chief executive of the association of train operating companies -lrb- atoc -rrb- , told the bbc news channel said the new structure meant " a variety of tickets to suit all pockets " .
pressure group campaign for better transport welcomed the changes but said train fares still need to be reduced .
speaking to the bbc news channel simon calder , travel editor of the independent newspaper , said : " we have a very complicated system of tickets in the uk - what they have done is change the labels to try and end the confusion . "
he said the proliferation of different ticket prices for the same rail journey was about " trying to squeeze more of us onto an inadequate rail system " .
" the label changes happening today may make life much easier for passengers but if you want to travel long-distance you are going to have to book a long time in advance and travel on a quiet train . "
in may a new advanced ticket replaced discounted offers such as leisure advance , business advance , value advance and apex .
the number of uk rail journeys has risen more than 40 % in the past decade .
