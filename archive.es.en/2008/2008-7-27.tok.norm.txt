but a recent survey by forsa , an opinion research institute , showed that 4 million germans have fallen victim to computer crime . they account for 7 percent of all computer users over 14 years , according to bitkom , the federal association of the information industry , telecommunications and new media .
around 1 percent of those questioned said they had suffered financial losses from online banking or online auctions .
an additional 3 percent reported dubious internet dialer programs .
another 2 percent reported damage due to viruses .
the survey also showed that many personal computers lack security programs .
while 83 percent of respondents had a virus protection program on their computer , only 67 percent used a firewall .
additionally , only 28 percent used an encryption program while 7 percent had no security mechanisms whatsoever .
networking sites a problem meanwhile , web sites for career networking are proving a virtual bonanza for cybercriminals .
as the users of corresponding social network platforms often reveal many personal details , the pages provide a rich source for spammers to gather data , says katrin alberts from the german federal agency for security in information technology -lrb- bsi -rrb- in berlin .
the information included there is increasingly being used for personalized phishing attacks .
career networking sites also offer criminals the chance to address employees in a inconspicuous way which , performed adeptly , can cause them to reveal valuable corporate information .
" for that reason we advise that social network users reveal as little personal data in their profiles as possible , " alberts says .
providing general contact data without responsibilities or functions is general sufficient for networking purposes .
any attempts to establish contact via e-mail should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism .
" cybercriminals try in this way to gain access to additional contacts and data , " alberts warns .
they do so by faking e-mail sender addresses and by cleverly using personal information to gain the trust of potential victims . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 27.07.2008 one in nine berliners wants the wall back , study shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital almost two decades after the fall of communism , it seems not all berliners are happy about the berlin wall being confined to the dustbin of history . every ninth berliner would prefer the barrier which used to divide and encircle the city was still in place , according to a survey carried out on behalf of berlin 's free university -lrb- fu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .
a spectacular new wall info pavilion will open there in late 2009 when the 20th anniversary of the barrier 's downfall will be celebrated . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .

austria 's bernhard kohl finished third , 1:13 adrift . gert steegmans of belgium won sunday 's stage , showing the best finishing kick on the cobblestones of what parisians call " the most beautiful avenue in the world . " sastre grabbed the race leader 's yellow jersey in wednesday 's 17th stage , with a bold solo attack that began at the foot of the gruelling 13.8-km climb to alpe d 'huez . he defended it , against expectations , in saturday 's 53-km individual time trial , losing only 29 seconds to evans . king of the mountain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos sastre on the victor 's podium during a previous stage in addition to his suprising third-place finish , the 26-year-old kohl also won the coveted king of the mountains title . sastre 's team csc teammate andy schleck of luxembourg was crowned the tour 's best rider under the age of 25 , while fellow spaniard oscar freire won the title of best sprinter . this year 's race was notable for the absence of last year 's champion , alberto contador , whose astana team was barred from participating for past doping infractions . saturday 's stage was primarily a coronation parade in honor of the winners .

this prompted the entire team to retire from the race . on sunday , july 27 , the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- said dmitriy fofonov of kazakhstan had tested positive for a banned stimulant after the 18th stage of the race .
fofonov finished the tour de france in 19th place overall .
but this year 's race also packed plenty of exciting performances , none more explosive than the four stage wins recorded by britain 's mark cavendish .
the ease with which he dominated his rivals more than confirmed his claim to be the world 's fastest sprinter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : euro-visions : debating europe 's future eu should become union of european regions , expert says europe needs better ideas , communication , expert says making the case for a multi-speed europe europeans seek eu response to global issues eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2008 greens politician : turkish eu entry is in europe 's interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu bid is an unprecedented project , oezdemir says members of the european union should be open about turkey 's eu accession bid as the country 's entry into the union would benefit the rest of the continent , writes greens lawmaker cem oezdemir for dw-world.de. cem oezdemir is a member of the european parliament and sits in the legislature 's foreign affairs committee .
he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .
it 's clear that a successful completion of this project is in our interest . cem oezdemir -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 27.07.2008 german expert calls china a " relatively difficult " partner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under schroeder , germany 's china policy was shaped by economics former chancellor schroeder has said he will attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing unlike his successor merkel .
dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 27.07.2008 lack of computer security hits 4 million people in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of computer users in germany does not think about security issues the internet is now part of everyday life for 80 percent of germans .
but a recent survey by forsa , an opinion research institute , showed that 4 million germans have fallen victim to computer crime . they account for 7 percent of all computer users over 14 years , according to bitkom , the federal association of the information industry , telecommunications and new media .
around 1 percent of those questioned said they had suffered financial losses from online banking or online auctions .
an additional 3 percent reported dubious internet dialer programs .
another 2 percent reported damage due to viruses .
the survey also showed that many personal computers lack security programs .
while 83 percent of respondents had a virus protection program on their computer , only 67 percent used a firewall .
additionally , only 28 percent used an encryption program while 7 percent had no security mechanisms whatsoever .
networking sites a problem meanwhile , web sites for career networking are proving a virtual bonanza for cybercriminals .

but a recent survey by forsa , an opinion research institute , showed that 4 million germans have fallen victim to computer crime . they account for 7 percent of all computer users over 14 years , according to bitkom , the federal association of the information industry , telecommunications and new media .
around 1 percent of those questioned said they had suffered financial losses from online banking or online auctions .
an additional 3 percent reported dubious internet dialer programs .
another 2 percent reported damage due to viruses .
the survey also showed that many personal computers lack security programs .
while 83 percent of respondents had a virus protection program on their computer , only 67 percent used a firewall .
additionally , only 28 percent used an encryption program while 7 percent had no security mechanisms whatsoever .

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .
" the project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient olympic stadium 50 years ago . " the area east of the sanctuary of olympia had not been the subject of archeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest structure built to host events there . according to pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .
it is only here , between the adjoining hills on the other side of the road to arcadia in the north and the bed of the alfeios river in the south that the topology is suitable for the accommodation of a race course with a length of more than one kilometer . the landscape in this area has changed so much that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct its appearance in ancient times . " without any need for excavation , modern geomagnetic techniques have given us the first clear indications of the site of the hippodrome east of the sanctuary of olympia , " said mueller .

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .
" the project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient olympic stadium 50 years ago . " the area east of the sanctuary of olympia had not been the subject of archeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest structure built to host events there . according to pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .
it is only here , between the adjoining hills on the other side of the road to arcadia in the north and the bed of the alfeios river in the south that the topology is suitable for the accommodation of a race course with a length of more than one kilometer . the landscape in this area has changed so much that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct its appearance in ancient times . " without any need for excavation , modern geomagnetic techniques have given us the first clear indications of the site of the hippodrome east of the sanctuary of olympia , " said mueller .
" this means that archeological and sports-historical research has come a little closer to solving one of the last great mysteries of olympia . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : euro-visions : debating europe 's future eu should become union of european regions , expert says europe needs better ideas , communication , expert says making the case for a multi-speed europe europeans seek eu response to global issues eu expansion -pipe- 27.07.2008 greens politician : turkish eu entry is in europe 's interest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu bid is an unprecedented project , oezdemir says members of the european union should be open about turkey 's eu accession bid as the country 's entry into the union would benefit the rest of the continent , writes greens lawmaker cem oezdemir for dw-world.de. cem oezdemir is a member of the european parliament and sits in the legislature 's foreign affairs committee .
he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .
it 's clear that a successful completion of this project is in our interest . cem oezdemir -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 27.07.2008 one in nine berliners wants the wall back , study shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital almost two decades after the fall of communism , it seems not all berliners are happy about the berlin wall being confined to the dustbin of history . every ninth berliner would prefer the barrier which used to divide and encircle the city was still in place , according to a survey carried out on behalf of berlin 's free university -lrb- fu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .
a spectacular new wall info pavilion will open there in late 2009 when the 20th anniversary of the barrier 's downfall will be celebrated . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sastre grabbed the race leader 's yellow jersey in wednesday 's 17th stage , with a bold solo attack that began at the foot of the gruelling 13.8-km climb to alpe d 'huez . he defended it , against expectations , in saturday 's 53-km individual time trial , losing only 29 seconds to evans . king of the mountain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos sastre on the victor 's podium during a previous stage in addition to his suprising third-place finish , the 26-year-old kohl also won the coveted king of the mountains title . sastre 's team csc teammate andy schleck of luxembourg was crowned the tour 's best rider under the age of 25 , while fellow spaniard oscar freire won the title of best sprinter . this year 's race was notable for the absence of last year 's champion , alberto contador , whose astana team was barred from participating for past doping infractions . saturday 's stage was primarily a coronation parade in honor of the winners .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .
a spectacular new wall info pavilion will open there in late 2009 when the 20th anniversary of the barrier 's downfall will be celebrated . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" steinmeier wrote that the country must " respond to its growing responsibility , " adding : " all ethnic groups must have a share in the development of this multicultural nation , where human rights and fundamental freedoms must be guaranteed and the state and society must open up more . " china 's human rights record has come under increasing scrutiny in the run-up to the games , with its global olympic flame procession interrupted by pro-tibet demonstrators in the united states , britain and france . germany , china 's biggest trading partner in europe , angering beijing last september when chancellor angela merkel gave a reception to tibet 's spiritual leader , the dalai lama . ' concrete improvements ' needed steinmeier 's opinion piece , to be published monday , said that in a world which is constantly remaking itself china would have a key role to play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier however , " concrete improvements " would be necessary , the foreign minister said , adding " we must , of course , discuss tibet . " there has been pressure , especially from rights activists , on world leaders to boycott the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics on august 8 .
neither merkel nor steinmeier are attending the games or the ceremony , but have spoken out against any boycott of the event . other leaders , such as us president george w. bush and french leader nicolas sarkozy , have announced they will go to the opening ceremony . human rights t-shirts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these official shirts wo n't likely offend the chinese , while the human rights t-shirts might german athletes soon to be on their way to beijing were presented with t-shirts on saturday by a group of former competitors to take with them to the olympics .

the dalai lama fled his homeland in 1959 following a failed uprising and has since lived in exile in india . china accuses him of being a separatist , but the 1989 nobel peace prize winner insists he does not want independence for tibet .
however he has repeatedly said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule as well as an end to religious and cultural repression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .

he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .

new accusations against a former nazi guard have brought up the atrocious history of belgrade 's killing fields . a boy on a bicycle , followed by a pack of dogs , passes an abandoned tower near the sava river in central belgrade , unaware that the structure was part of a nazi death camp during world war ii . the site , known as staro sajmiste or old fairgrounds , usually gives no pause to belgrade residents who pass it daily on one of the capital 's busiest bridges .
but accusations against a former nazi living in the united states have brought its history into focus . serbia plans to ask the us to extradite peter egner , 86 , who has admitted serving as a guard and interpreter in the special police unit blamed for the killing of 17,000 people at the camp - mainly yugoslav jews , serbs and roma .
most of belgrade 's 8,000 jews died there . staro sajmiste was not the only nazi prison in german-occupied belgrade , but it was the most hated .
it was located so close to the city that , according to witnesses , one could hear prisoners ' screams wafting over the river . gassing replaced mass shootings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler " it was worst at night when children , hungry and cold , cried and asked their mothers to cover them and give them food .
it lasted all night , and many of us could n't sleep , feeling sorry for those innocent children , " survivor sarlota cosic was quoted as saying in a post-war book on nazi crimes against jews in yugoslavia . egner , now a retiree living in a retirement home near seattle , washington , was part of one of several mobile killing units that roamed eastern europe and the soviet union as part of the nazis ' " final solution " to exterminate the jews . in belgrade , more than 6,000 victims were asphyxiated with exhaust fumes pumped into a sealed van .
the nazis used similar mobile gas chambers farther east , reportedly because ss chief heinrich himmler worried that mass shootings were putting mental strain on the nazi executioners . symbol of modernism used for executions the staro sajmiste complex was built in 1937 , four years before nazi germany invaded and occupied then-yugoslavia .
it marked the moment when belgrade spread to the left bank of the sava and began building a modern extension known as new belgrade . sajmiste was designed as an exhibition complex of several pavilions centered around the tower , a little white town surrounded by lush green vegetation . in 1941 , with the nazi occupation , the exhibition center became a place of torture and death before the eyes of belgrade .
almost the entire jewish population of the city vanished in the camp or was sent to other camps in belgrade or elsewhere . former nazi guard denies crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument at staro sajmiste recalls the thousands who died there egner , who was born in the former yugoslavia , denies wrongdoing .
us authorities plan to revoke his passport because he concealed his sajmiste past when he applied for citizenship in the 1960s . " i 've never hurt anyone in my belgrade , " egner told belgrade media .
" you have my word . " some 6,400 jews and 600 roma were brought to the fairgrounds camp starting in december 1941 .
most died in the vans , which gassed about 50 prisoners at a time while transporting them to a mass execution and burial site near belgrade . " i worked for two months digging holes for the bodies , " survivor vladimir milutinovic said in the book on nazi crimes .
" we dug 81 or 82 holes and each could take at least a 100 people . " from may 1942 until july 1944 , the camp was also a roundup center for thousands of prisoners who were sent to other camps .
in total , 32,000 people were taken to sajmiste . site now home to artists ' families after world war ii , yugoslav authorities turned over the site to local artists for use as studios .
today , several roma families and descendants of the artists live in shacks and trailers , while some companies have their offices on the premises . only the tower and the central pavilion survived the allied bombing of belgrade in 1944 and the later neglect .
british rock group kosheen planned to hold a concert last winter in the pavilion , but backed off after a public uproar . various groups have tried for decades to raise money to turn the site into a memorial with an exhibition on its world war ii past .
but the project has always stalled - in part because sajmiste 's residents do n't want to move out . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new accusations against a former nazi guard have brought up the atrocious history of belgrade 's killing fields . a boy on a bicycle , followed by a pack of dogs , passes an abandoned tower near the sava river in central belgrade , unaware that the structure was part of a nazi death camp during world war ii . the site , known as staro sajmiste or old fairgrounds , usually gives no pause to belgrade residents who pass it daily on one of the capital 's busiest bridges .
but accusations against a former nazi living in the united states have brought its history into focus . serbia plans to ask the us to extradite peter egner , 86 , who has admitted serving as a guard and interpreter in the special police unit blamed for the killing of 17,000 people at the camp - mainly yugoslav jews , serbs and roma .
most of belgrade 's 8,000 jews died there . staro sajmiste was not the only nazi prison in german-occupied belgrade , but it was the most hated .
it was located so close to the city that , according to witnesses , one could hear prisoners ' screams wafting over the river . gassing replaced mass shootings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler " it was worst at night when children , hungry and cold , cried and asked their mothers to cover them and give them food .

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .
" the project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient olympic stadium 50 years ago . " the area east of the sanctuary of olympia had not been the subject of archeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest structure built to host events there . according to pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .
it is only here , between the adjoining hills on the other side of the road to arcadia in the north and the bed of the alfeios river in the south that the topology is suitable for the accommodation of a race course with a length of more than one kilometer . the landscape in this area has changed so much that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct its appearance in ancient times . " without any need for excavation , modern geomagnetic techniques have given us the first clear indications of the site of the hippodrome east of the sanctuary of olympia , " said mueller .

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 27.07.2008 one in nine berliners wants the wall back , study shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital almost two decades after the fall of communism , it seems not all berliners are happy about the berlin wall being confined to the dustbin of history . every ninth berliner would prefer the barrier which used to divide and encircle the city was still in place , according to a survey carried out on behalf of berlin 's free university -lrb- fu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .
a spectacular new wall info pavilion will open there in late 2009 when the 20th anniversary of the barrier 's downfall will be celebrated . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new accusations against a former nazi guard have brought up the atrocious history of belgrade 's killing fields . a boy on a bicycle , followed by a pack of dogs , passes an abandoned tower near the sava river in central belgrade , unaware that the structure was part of a nazi death camp during world war ii . the site , known as staro sajmiste or old fairgrounds , usually gives no pause to belgrade residents who pass it daily on one of the capital 's busiest bridges .
but accusations against a former nazi living in the united states have brought its history into focus . serbia plans to ask the us to extradite peter egner , 86 , who has admitted serving as a guard and interpreter in the special police unit blamed for the killing of 17,000 people at the camp - mainly yugoslav jews , serbs and roma .
most of belgrade 's 8,000 jews died there . staro sajmiste was not the only nazi prison in german-occupied belgrade , but it was the most hated .
it was located so close to the city that , according to witnesses , one could hear prisoners ' screams wafting over the river . gassing replaced mass shootings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler " it was worst at night when children , hungry and cold , cried and asked their mothers to cover them and give them food .
it lasted all night , and many of us could n't sleep , feeling sorry for those innocent children , " survivor sarlota cosic was quoted as saying in a post-war book on nazi crimes against jews in yugoslavia . egner , now a retiree living in a retirement home near seattle , washington , was part of one of several mobile killing units that roamed eastern europe and the soviet union as part of the nazis ' " final solution " to exterminate the jews . in belgrade , more than 6,000 victims were asphyxiated with exhaust fumes pumped into a sealed van .
the nazis used similar mobile gas chambers farther east , reportedly because ss chief heinrich himmler worried that mass shootings were putting mental strain on the nazi executioners . symbol of modernism used for executions the staro sajmiste complex was built in 1937 , four years before nazi germany invaded and occupied then-yugoslavia .
it marked the moment when belgrade spread to the left bank of the sava and began building a modern extension known as new belgrade . sajmiste was designed as an exhibition complex of several pavilions centered around the tower , a little white town surrounded by lush green vegetation . in 1941 , with the nazi occupation , the exhibition center became a place of torture and death before the eyes of belgrade .
almost the entire jewish population of the city vanished in the camp or was sent to other camps in belgrade or elsewhere . former nazi guard denies crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument at staro sajmiste recalls the thousands who died there egner , who was born in the former yugoslavia , denies wrongdoing .
us authorities plan to revoke his passport because he concealed his sajmiste past when he applied for citizenship in the 1960s . " i 've never hurt anyone in my belgrade , " egner told belgrade media .
" you have my word . " some 6,400 jews and 600 roma were brought to the fairgrounds camp starting in december 1941 .
most died in the vans , which gassed about 50 prisoners at a time while transporting them to a mass execution and burial site near belgrade . " i worked for two months digging holes for the bodies , " survivor vladimir milutinovic said in the book on nazi crimes .
" we dug 81 or 82 holes and each could take at least a 100 people . " from may 1942 until july 1944 , the camp was also a roundup center for thousands of prisoners who were sent to other camps .
in total , 32,000 people were taken to sajmiste . site now home to artists ' families after world war ii , yugoslav authorities turned over the site to local artists for use as studios .
today , several roma families and descendants of the artists live in shacks and trailers , while some companies have their offices on the premises . only the tower and the central pavilion survived the allied bombing of belgrade in 1944 and the later neglect .
british rock group kosheen planned to hold a concert last winter in the pavilion , but backed off after a public uproar . various groups have tried for decades to raise money to turn the site into a memorial with an exhibition on its world war ii past .
but the project has always stalled - in part because sajmiste 's residents do n't want to move out . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .
" the project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient olympic stadium 50 years ago . " the area east of the sanctuary of olympia had not been the subject of archeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest structure built to host events there . according to pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .
it is only here , between the adjoining hills on the other side of the road to arcadia in the north and the bed of the alfeios river in the south that the topology is suitable for the accommodation of a race course with a length of more than one kilometer . the landscape in this area has changed so much that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct its appearance in ancient times .

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .
" the project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient olympic stadium 50 years ago . " the area east of the sanctuary of olympia had not been the subject of archeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest structure built to host events there . according to pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .

" sastre grabbed the race leader 's yellow jersey in wednesday 's 17th stage , with a bold solo attack that began at the foot of the gruelling 13.8-km climb to alpe d 'huez . he defended it , against expectations , in saturday 's 53-km individual time trial , losing only 29 seconds to evans . king of the mountain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos sastre on the victor 's podium during a previous stage in addition to his suprising third-place finish , the 26-year-old kohl also won the coveted king of the mountains title . sastre 's team csc teammate andy schleck of luxembourg was crowned the tour 's best rider under the age of 25 , while fellow spaniard oscar freire won the title of best sprinter . this year 's race was notable for the absence of last year 's champion , alberto contador , whose astana team was barred from participating for past doping infractions . saturday 's stage was primarily a coronation parade in honor of the winners .

fofonov finished the tour de france in 19th place overall .

" steinmeier wrote that the country must " respond to its growing responsibility , " adding : " all ethnic groups must have a share in the development of this multicultural nation , where human rights and fundamental freedoms must be guaranteed and the state and society must open up more . " china 's human rights record has come under increasing scrutiny in the run-up to the games , with its global olympic flame procession interrupted by pro-tibet demonstrators in the united states , britain and france . germany , china 's biggest trading partner in europe , angering beijing last september when chancellor angela merkel gave a reception to tibet 's spiritual leader , the dalai lama . ' concrete improvements ' needed steinmeier 's opinion piece , to be published monday , said that in a world which is constantly remaking itself china would have a key role to play . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier however , " concrete improvements " would be necessary , the foreign minister said , adding " we must , of course , discuss tibet . " there has been pressure , especially from rights activists , on world leaders to boycott the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics on august 8 .
neither merkel nor steinmeier are attending the games or the ceremony , but have spoken out against any boycott of the event . other leaders , such as us president george w. bush and french leader nicolas sarkozy , have announced they will go to the opening ceremony . human rights t-shirts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these official shirts wo n't likely offend the chinese , while the human rights t-shirts might german athletes soon to be on their way to beijing were presented with t-shirts on saturday by a group of former competitors to take with them to the olympics .
the shirts highlighted human rights issues . the t-shirts bore the slogans " fair games , " " sport for human rights , " " celebrate humanity , " " free tibet " and " free china . " china has ruled tibet since 1951 , a year after sending troops in to " liberate " the remote himalayan region .
the dalai lama fled his homeland in 1959 following a failed uprising and has since lived in exile in india . china accuses him of being a separatist , but the 1989 nobel peace prize winner insists he does not want independence for tibet .
however he has repeatedly said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule as well as an end to religious and cultural repression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .

he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .
it 's clear that a successful completion of this project is in our interest . cem oezdemir -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria 's bernhard kohl finished third , 1:13 adrift . gert steegmans of belgium won sunday 's stage , showing the best finishing kick on the cobblestones of what parisians call " the most beautiful avenue in the world . " sastre grabbed the race leader 's yellow jersey in wednesday 's 17th stage , with a bold solo attack that began at the foot of the gruelling 13.8-km climb to alpe d 'huez . he defended it , against expectations , in saturday 's 53-km individual time trial , losing only 29 seconds to evans . king of the mountain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos sastre on the victor 's podium during a previous stage in addition to his suprising third-place finish , the 26-year-old kohl also won the coveted king of the mountains title . sastre 's team csc teammate andy schleck of luxembourg was crowned the tour 's best rider under the age of 25 , while fellow spaniard oscar freire won the title of best sprinter . this year 's race was notable for the absence of last year 's champion , alberto contador , whose astana team was barred from participating for past doping infractions . saturday 's stage was primarily a coronation parade in honor of the winners .
as a result , it took 3 hours 51 minutes 38 seconds to race the 143 kilometres from etampes to paris , a leisurely average speed of 37.04 kph . doping cases the tour was also marked by several doping cases , with spaniards manuel beltran and moises duenas and the young italian riccardo ricco booted from the race for testing positive for forms of the blood booster epo . ricco 's saunier-duval italian teammate leonardo piepoli was also dropped by his team after reportedly confessing to having used a banned substance to win the 10th stage .
this prompted the entire team to retire from the race . on sunday , july 27 , the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- said dmitriy fofonov of kazakhstan had tested positive for a banned stimulant after the 18th stage of the race .
fofonov finished the tour de france in 19th place overall .
but this year 's race also packed plenty of exciting performances , none more explosive than the four stage wins recorded by britain 's mark cavendish .
the ease with which he dominated his rivals more than confirmed his claim to be the world 's fastest sprinter .

but a recent survey by forsa , an opinion research institute , showed that 4 million germans have fallen victim to computer crime . they account for 7 percent of all computer users over 14 years , according to bitkom , the federal association of the information industry , telecommunications and new media .
around 1 percent of those questioned said they had suffered financial losses from online banking or online auctions .
an additional 3 percent reported dubious internet dialer programs .
another 2 percent reported damage due to viruses .
the survey also showed that many personal computers lack security programs .
while 83 percent of respondents had a virus protection program on their computer , only 67 percent used a firewall .
additionally , only 28 percent used an encryption program while 7 percent had no security mechanisms whatsoever .
networking sites a problem meanwhile , web sites for career networking are proving a virtual bonanza for cybercriminals .
as the users of corresponding social network platforms often reveal many personal details , the pages provide a rich source for spammers to gather data , says katrin alberts from the german federal agency for security in information technology -lrb- bsi -rrb- in berlin .
the information included there is increasingly being used for personalized phishing attacks .
career networking sites also offer criminals the chance to address employees in a inconspicuous way which , performed adeptly , can cause them to reveal valuable corporate information .
" for that reason we advise that social network users reveal as little personal data in their profiles as possible , " alberts says .
providing general contact data without responsibilities or functions is general sufficient for networking purposes .
any attempts to establish contact via e-mail should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism .
" cybercriminals try in this way to gain access to additional contacts and data , " alberts warns .
they do so by faking e-mail sender addresses and by cleverly using personal information to gain the trust of potential victims . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the two leaders ' differing approaches to china . earlier this month , former german chancellor gerhard schroeder said he will travel to beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
his successor , angela merkel , who has taken a tougher line on china , is staying away .
in an article , schroeder criticized merkel 's firm public stance on human rights in china , saying europe can only influence china through " cooperation based on trust " and not through public denunciations .
dw-world.de spoke with gudrun wacker , asia and china expert at the german institute for international and security affairs about whether germany 's china policy has fundamentally changed and how , if at all , the country can positively influence china 's position on human rights .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder has announced he is going to attend the opening ceremony of the olympic games in beijing while current chancellor angela merkel has said she 's not .
how significant is this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gudrun wacker says there has n't been a radical shift in germany 's china policy it 's not really significant because chancellor merkel never planned on attending the opening ceremony .
it was always clear that she plans to travel to china only once this year - for the asem -lrb- asia europe meeting -rrb- summit in october .
that 's why it 's not correct when the german media reports that the chancellor is " boycotting " the opening ceremony of the olympic games .
schroeder has accused the conservative christian democrats and their sister bavarian party , the christian social union , of damaging relations with china with a new strategy paper on asia that calls for a break with germany 's previous china policy . what do you think of his criticism ?
the strategy paper was published at a time when there was a lot of bad blood between germany and china because of chancellor merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama .
that 's why it seemed a bit like germany 's whole position on china was being revamped .
but if you actually look at germany 's china policy , nothing really important has changed .
this strategy paper is an attempt to take into account the whole asian region , whose economic and political significance has increased in the past years .
at the same time , the paper addresses fears and concerns among the population also because the media 's reporting on china is partly extremely negative .
do you agree that this strategy paper has caused " huge damage on the foreign policy front ? "
the document has been drawn up by a parliamentary group .
it 's not the parliament but the government that is responsible for foreign policy - the foreign ministry , the federal chancellery and other ministries all play a role .
the strategy paper may have ruffled feathers in china , but as i said before , it was because of the merkel-dalai lama meeting .
i ca n't really judge whether it 's caused serious damage .
the strategy paper emphasizes the importance of india and japan for germany .
does that signal a shift in germany 's asia policy ?
germany 's foreign policy is embedded in european policies on asia .
the european security strategy of javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , from 2003 lists three countries with which the european union aspires to have a strategic partnership - india , china and japan .
if you look at how often leading german leaders travel to these countries , then china tops the list .
the strategy paper by the conservative parties is an attempt to show that there are other important partners in the region apart from china .
for instance , india is gaining in importance and is the partner for germany in south asia .
that 's why i do n't think that much has changed in germany 's policies on the region and definitely not because of the strategy paper .
relations between germany and china have cooled of late .
how does that affect ties between europe and china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama incensed the chinese goverment " cooled " is the wrong word .
there simply have been more rows with china in the past years .
for the eu , this has mainly to do with economic and trade issues .
the more you trade with each other , the greater the possibility that there will be a row .
besides , the population in europe fears china much more than was the case five years ago .
that 's because china has become much more stronger - especially economically - and has turned out to be a relatively difficult partner when it comes to certain issues such as climate change which is important to eu and german foreign policy .
it 's said that germany 's china policy under former chancellor schroeder was shaped by economic issues whereas chancellor merkel 's policy is more political and value-based .
do you agree ?
i think the economy plays a central role and germany , just like the eu , is trying to support china in its reform policies and internal reforms .
i do n't think it 's right to see things in black and white - under schroeder , the economy dictated policy and now values are a priority .
it 's simply not true if you look at the many layers of germany-china relations .
schroeder also criticized what he said were " ritualistic , symbolic activities , which are only aimed at the german public " in his remarks about china .
what do you think of that ?
of course you have to repeatedly bring up human rights .
the question is how you do it and which approach can in the long run lead to changes .
for example , we have an ongoing dialogue with china on the rule of law .
the larger public does n't take part in it but that does n't mean that the dialogue is superfluous or senseless .
the other way around , it 's easy to say germany 's current china policy is only aimed at voters in germany .
that 's certainly not an absolute but domestic politics does play a role in the china policy .
do you think germany is on the right path to positively influencing human rights in china ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder , here with chinese premier wen jiabao , is said to have focused too much on business with china during his term i think we have very few possibilities to really influence china from the outside .
the situation usually changes when certain developments take place in china that lead to the realization that you have to do something about a problem .
that was very apparent on the death penalty .
but we can still offer support by inviting judges , lawyers , state prosecutors and also law professors from china , train people and discuss with them so that there 's a readiness to offer solutions in china .
how do you compare the china policy of schroeder and the merkel government ? first off , i 'd say that i see more continuity rather than breaks .
china is seen as an important partner , not just on economics but when it comes to global problems - for instance , when it comes to weapons of mass destruction and climate change .
these problems ca n't be solved without constructively engaging china to work on a solution .
if the mood has changed a bit , it 's because intensive contacts have led to some conflicts .
another reason is that a certain soberness with europe has set in china , that it ca n't be a counterweight to the us . meng junhong interviewed gudrun wacker -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .
a spectacular new wall info pavilion will open there in late 2009 when the 20th anniversary of the barrier 's downfall will be celebrated . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 27.07.2008 one in nine berliners wants the wall back , study shows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the berlin wall are still a major tourist attraction in the german capital almost two decades after the fall of communism , it seems not all berliners are happy about the berlin wall being confined to the dustbin of history . every ninth berliner would prefer the barrier which used to divide and encircle the city was still in place , according to a survey carried out on behalf of berlin 's free university -lrb- fu -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the berlin wall was a unique moment in european history professor oskar niedermayer , 56 , a political scientist at the fu , says that of the 2,000 citizens in berlin and the surrounding state of brandenburg who participated in the survey this spring , 11 percent in west berlin and 12 percent in east berlin considered it would be better if the wall was still in place .
while the outcome might be surprising , niedermayer suggests it is hardly a sensation .
only in east berlin is there a significant change of attitude to be perceived , with 12 per cent of those asked wishing the wall was still there , against 7 percent in a 2004 poll .
nationwide , such sentiment was even more strongly expressed four years ago when surveys by two of germany 's leading research institutes showed 19-21 percent in favour of the wall .
prejudices still alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , one part of the berlin wall is a backdrop for a beach bar while fewer people today dispute the causes of german unification , some " wessis , " as west germans are sometimes called , and " ossies " -lrb- east germans -rrb- still harbour prejudices against people living in the other half of the country , though apparently much less so than in the 1990s .
then , it was not uncommon for people in the east to feel the former german democratic republic had been conquered " colonial style " by west germany after the communist collapse in 1989-90 .
nowadays , only in fringe areas of brandenburg are such sentiments occasionally expressed among small minorities , notes the survey .
in the west , on the other hand , a cliche often heard is that people in eastern germany indulge in too much " self-pity . "
the survey , conducted for the fu by the forsa institute , also points to citizens who were fully integrated into the socialist system and who were born in east germany before 1973 as being among those most likely to want the wall back .
winners and losers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some berliners would like to see the wall back where it once stood for years after the demise of the berlin wall there was discussion in the east and west of germany about the so-called " winners and losers " of reunification .
in outlying areas of brandenburg some 19 percent of people surveyed felt they were reunification losers , while 37 percent considered things would be better if the berlin wall and the former 1,120-kilometre inner-german border , once separating east from west germany , had remained .
only 3 percent of people in these parts regarded themselves as reunification " winners . "
the dismantling of the berlin wall first began on the historic night of nov .
9 , 1989 to allow the ebullient masses to pass through to the west .
but it was not until later in 1990 that the task of tearing down the barrier began in earnest .
cleaning up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin government is planning to extend the wall memorial site on bernauer strasse army units set about demolishing 300 watchtowers , thousands of lamp posts and more than 80 kilometres of metal fencing from around the city barrier .
later a private company called ava was called in to remove 160,000 tons of still remaining concrete from around berlin alone .
at a glittering auction in monaco in june 1990 segments of the wall were sold , fetching a fortune .
successful buyers included cognac heiress ljilijiana hennessy and jaguba rizzoli , the widow of an italian publisher .
later , several japanese entrepreneurs also arrived to buy graffiti-decorated slabs of the barrier .
winston churchill 's grand-daughter also acquired eight pieces of the wall , which were later displayed in the park of westminster college in fulton , missouri , where churchill made his famous " iron curtain " speech some 60 years ago .
bildunterschrift : tourists ca n't get enough of the wall but where is it ?
a common complaint of berlin tourists today is that there are few visible traces of the wall to be seen anymore .
centrally , only the checkpoint charlie museum , with its history of daring wall escapes still operates , attracting tens of thousands visitors annually .
aware of foreign criticism on this point the berlin authorities now plan to extend the 1.3-kilometer long wall memorial site on the city 's bernauer strasse , where once the barrier cut off people living in houses on one side of the street from those on the other .
a spectacular new wall info pavilion will open there in late 2009 when the 20th anniversary of the barrier 's downfall will be celebrated . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

emperor nero famously competed in the races himself , conveniently " winning " each event he took part in at olympia . no visible remains of the hippodrome exist today , but scholars have made efforts to reconstruct the racecourse from descriptions left by ancient texts , including the writings of an ancient scholar named pausanias . now , for the first time , the site has been located definitively by a research team that included norbert mueller , a sports historian from mainz , as well as christian wacker , a sports archeologist from cologne , and reinhard senff , chief excavator from the german archeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- . " this discovery is an archeological sensation , " said mueller of the johannes gutenberg university at mainz .
the research project extended over several weeks before being completed in mid-may . floods covered hippodrome site with silt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman chariot races took place at the circus maximus prior to this , the hippodrome had only been known from written sources .
its actual location had never been found , although german archeologists have been continuously excavating the site where the ancient olympics were held since 1875 . since then , archeologists and sports historians from all over the world have been involved in trying to solve this secret . the area , described by pausanias to the east of the sanctuary of olympia , has been flooded by the alfeios river since ancient times and is covered with silt .
in modern plans and descriptions it is usually stated quite simply that " nothing remains of the hippodrome due to flooding in medieval times . " this served as an additional incentive for the german researchers : using modern geophysical methods , they systematically searched the area for the first time . the hippodrome begins to take shape experts armin grubert from mainz and christian huebner from freiburg , who specialize in the use of geomagnetic and geo-radar techniques , were able to map soil disturbances such as water courses , ditches , and walls . they detected conspicuous , rectilinear structures along a stretch of almost 1,200 meters -lrb- 4,000 feet -rrb- .
the researchers believe this to be the hippodrome race course , which ran parallel to the stadium .
structural remains identified as the temple of demeter , known to have been sited near the hippodrome , were discovered in the northern part of the area investigated in the spring of 2007 . of particular interest is the fact that at the halfway point of the northern access to the starting-gates - where pausanias describes the chariot entryway to the hippodrome - there is a circular arrangement with a diameter of about 10 meters , clearly marked in the ancient soil layer , which could be the remains of the sacred structure described here by the ancient writer . the actual starting-gates , with boxes for up to 24 teams of horses , are most probably located under a gigantic pile of earth excavated by the archeologists investigating the temple area since 1875 . the investigation of the area east of the sanctuary of olympia , funded by the institute of sports science of the university of mainz and the international riding association , has produced the first concrete indications of the location of the race course and its geographical dimensions . ten students were on hand to assist mueller , who is an authority on olympia . bildunterschrift : ancient olympia remains a source of fascination for history and sports buffs alike great olympia mystery nearly solved " the dai , with its branch in athens , has done sports history a great service through its contribution , " says mueller .
" the project could become a new attraction for the sports world , similar to the excavation of the ancient olympic stadium 50 years ago . " the area east of the sanctuary of olympia had not been the subject of archeological investigation before , although the ancient written sources show that this must have been the site of the largest structure built to host events there . according to pausanias , the hippodrome lay south of the now researched and reconstructed stadium , and must now be several meters below the current level .
it is only here , between the adjoining hills on the other side of the road to arcadia in the north and the bed of the alfeios river in the south that the topology is suitable for the accommodation of a race course with a length of more than one kilometer . the landscape in this area has changed so much that it is nearly impossible to reconstruct its appearance in ancient times . " without any need for excavation , modern geomagnetic techniques have given us the first clear indications of the site of the hippodrome east of the sanctuary of olympia , " said mueller .
" this means that archeological and sports-historical research has come a little closer to solving one of the last great mysteries of olympia . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is also a candidate for the leadership of the german greens , which is up for election in november . the eu and turkey have negotiated accession since oct .
3 , 2005 after eu leaders gave the green light in december 2004 .
despite this unanimous decision , the turkish eu bid sparks controversial and emotional debates . but this row is not just about turkey .
that country 's membership begs the question : what is europe and what should it be ?
there are parallels to the german debate about a so-called leading culture .
in that case , we 're not just talking about integrating immigrants , but also assuring ourselves about the future and identity of our society .
the debate about the eu 's borders and its expansion is also a kind of self-assurance in this respect .
but what is europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem oezdemir the eu 's member states are close economically .
it would be wrong to set aside economic integration when trying to come up with a common definition for europe - as if it plays a smaller role than supposedly objective national borders and shared cultural values .
the importance of political integration becomes apparent when looking at the challenges that one country can not shoulder on its own . whether talking about demographic change , climate change , the fight against terrorism or the global fight against poverty and hunger - the european union offers a unique potential for the effective cooperation of states .
the eu reform treaty is an important step in that direction - even if it certainly wo n't be the final one . but solidarity and cooperation , which come with a surrender of sovereignty in the case of the eu , are not just based on the power of facts - they also feed on internal prerequisites that go further than that .
i see 20th century history as the foundation . vision , not essence for me , today 's europe is a vision and a project that would not be conceivable without the catastrophe of world war ii .
to me , europe and the eu symbolize the ideals of peace , democracy and freedom of opinion .
the realization of these ideals on a daily basis is meant to prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again in europe . having said that , i think it 's hardly convincing to define europe exclusively in terms of its judeo-christian heritage or enlightenment .
there are no objective , essentialist criteria , which could completely determine our identity and future .
geographers and historians refer to europe 's " constructed " borders . so what is europe ?
according to our own conception , it 's a place where human rights , freedom of opinion and democracy are nonnegotiable values .
but that 's not an intrinsic quality , but rather something that we want . the war in yugoslavia , which happened not too long ago , and the involvement of member states in cia abductions and inhumane arrests at guantanamo prove that we are far from having reached the end of that development .
if there are states that want to join the eu and know exactly about the importance of these values for us , that 's a confirmation of the visionary idea and the success of the european union . in that sense , it 's pretty pointless to ask whether turkey 's " essence " belongs to europe or not .
since the country sees itself as a part of europe and wants to become an eu member , it 's not important what europe is or is n't .
instead , what counts is what kind of the eu we want and which role turkey should play .
religious and cultural questions should not be left out when engaging in a public debate about the eu expansion - but they should not play a role when making a decision for or against a country 's membership . stick to the facts the membership criteria are well known : the relevant copenhagen criteria call for a functioning and competitive market economy , democracy , the rule of law , respecting human rights , the protection of minorities as well as the adoption of existing eu laws .
the adoption of eu laws happens in 35 chapters and is strictly controlled . while the criteria for accession are clear , certain people continue to argue against a turkish membership from a culture-based point of view .
in that context , the country 's islamic character is frequently mentioned - be it overtly or covertly .
but we should really finally lay to rest culture-based , essentialist views , as if the culture of a country and its population can not change over time .
former membership candidates spain and ireland prove this ability to change - as does germany . a successful fulfillment of the membership criteria , which is strictly monitored in the case of turkey as it 's never been done before , will not only change turkey economically and politically , but certainly also in terms of the country 's cultural character .
just think of what needs to happen in the education sector . an unprecedented effort but that does n't mean that turkey has to become atheist or christian .
instead , turkey and its population have to prove in an unprecedented effort that islam , on the one hand , and democracy , human rights , market economy and protection of minorities , on the other , don ’ t contradict each other . a few years ago , syrian regime critic and publicist michel kilo reminded people in berlin that the view of turkey in middle eastern societies had changed .
not too long ago , the successor state to the ottoman empire had been seen as a traitor because of its nato membership and its good relations with israel .
today the country is respected for its democratic elections , press freedom and economic development , he said .
ankara is also playing an important role as a mediator in the mideast conflict . keeping that in mind , turkey 's eu integration is not only in turkey 's but also in europe 's interest .
civil societies and reform-oriented forces in middle eastern countries are curious about turkey 's future path .
member states should therefore not see turkey as a match-ball for domestic politics , but accept it as a positive challenge and accompany the country honestly and still critically on its way into the eu .
it 's clear that a successful completion of this project is in our interest . cem oezdemir -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new accusations against a former nazi guard have brought up the atrocious history of belgrade 's killing fields . a boy on a bicycle , followed by a pack of dogs , passes an abandoned tower near the sava river in central belgrade , unaware that the structure was part of a nazi death camp during world war ii . the site , known as staro sajmiste or old fairgrounds , usually gives no pause to belgrade residents who pass it daily on one of the capital 's busiest bridges .
but accusations against a former nazi living in the united states have brought its history into focus . serbia plans to ask the us to extradite peter egner , 86 , who has admitted serving as a guard and interpreter in the special police unit blamed for the killing of 17,000 people at the camp - mainly yugoslav jews , serbs and roma .
most of belgrade 's 8,000 jews died there . staro sajmiste was not the only nazi prison in german-occupied belgrade , but it was the most hated .
it was located so close to the city that , according to witnesses , one could hear prisoners ' screams wafting over the river . gassing replaced mass shootings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler " it was worst at night when children , hungry and cold , cried and asked their mothers to cover them and give them food .
it lasted all night , and many of us could n't sleep , feeling sorry for those innocent children , " survivor sarlota cosic was quoted as saying in a post-war book on nazi crimes against jews in yugoslavia . egner , now a retiree living in a retirement home near seattle , washington , was part of one of several mobile killing units that roamed eastern europe and the soviet union as part of the nazis ' " final solution " to exterminate the jews . in belgrade , more than 6,000 victims were asphyxiated with exhaust fumes pumped into a sealed van .
the nazis used similar mobile gas chambers farther east , reportedly because ss chief heinrich himmler worried that mass shootings were putting mental strain on the nazi executioners . symbol of modernism used for executions the staro sajmiste complex was built in 1937 , four years before nazi germany invaded and occupied then-yugoslavia .
it marked the moment when belgrade spread to the left bank of the sava and began building a modern extension known as new belgrade . sajmiste was designed as an exhibition complex of several pavilions centered around the tower , a little white town surrounded by lush green vegetation . in 1941 , with the nazi occupation , the exhibition center became a place of torture and death before the eyes of belgrade .
almost the entire jewish population of the city vanished in the camp or was sent to other camps in belgrade or elsewhere . former nazi guard denies crimes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument at staro sajmiste recalls the thousands who died there egner , who was born in the former yugoslavia , denies wrongdoing .
us authorities plan to revoke his passport because he concealed his sajmiste past when he applied for citizenship in the 1960s . " i 've never hurt anyone in my belgrade , " egner told belgrade media .
" you have my word . " some 6,400 jews and 600 roma were brought to the fairgrounds camp starting in december 1941 .
most died in the vans , which gassed about 50 prisoners at a time while transporting them to a mass execution and burial site near belgrade . " i worked for two months digging holes for the bodies , " survivor vladimir milutinovic said in the book on nazi crimes .
" we dug 81 or 82 holes and each could take at least a 100 people . " from may 1942 until july 1944 , the camp was also a roundup center for thousands of prisoners who were sent to other camps .
in total , 32,000 people were taken to sajmiste . site now home to artists ' families after world war ii , yugoslav authorities turned over the site to local artists for use as studios .
today , several roma families and descendants of the artists live in shacks and trailers , while some companies have their offices on the premises . only the tower and the central pavilion survived the allied bombing of belgrade in 1944 and the later neglect .
british rock group kosheen planned to hold a concert last winter in the pavilion , but backed off after a public uproar . various groups have tried for decades to raise money to turn the site into a memorial with an exhibition on its world war ii past .
but the project has always stalled - in part because sajmiste 's residents do n't want to move out . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
