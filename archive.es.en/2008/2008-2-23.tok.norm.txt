click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !
it 's supposed to be a really beautiful city .
maybe i 'll come for oktoberfest .
i 'd also like to take a boat trip on the rhine river , from the swiss border to the dutch border . what i like best about germany : as a dane , it 's easy traveling in germany because i do n't have any language problems .
most danes speak german .
compared to denmark , everything is much cheaper here , especially eating out .

the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !
it 's supposed to be a really beautiful city .
maybe i 'll come for oktoberfest .
i 'd also like to take a boat trip on the rhine river , from the swiss border to the dutch border . what i like best about germany : as a dane , it 's easy traveling in germany because i do n't have any language problems .
most danes speak german .
compared to denmark , everything is much cheaper here , especially eating out .
i like that germany is so big and diverse , with changing landscapes and beautiful cities .
i 'd also like to visit hamburg , berlin and bonn . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .
a strategy to win customer loyalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small stores can not compete with organic supermarkets like this one for many food retailers , the image associated with organic food is more important than the profits that they earn .
" it is a form of advertising that encourages customer loyalty .
i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .
over the next few weeks , it will become clear if the storeowner will be forced to give up his business .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .
a strategy to win customer loyalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small stores can not compete with organic supermarkets like this one for many food retailers , the image associated with organic food is more important than the profits that they earn .
" it is a form of advertising that encourages customer loyalty .
i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .
over the next few weeks , it will become clear if the storeowner will be forced to give up his business .
murmann is n't optimistic .
in berlin , germany 's first-ever organic food shop has just closed its doors . linda vierecke -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de poor labeling curbs sale of organic products how do you know if organic food really is organic ?
as the sector booms , more customers are looking for official certification labels .
but there are several types that are often confusing and sometimes even hard to find .
-lrb- 26.01.2008 -rrb- berlin agrees on new gm labeling law - but how strict is it ?
with a view to creating greater transparency for consumers , germany is to introduce a special label for food that has not been genetically modified , such as products from animals that have not been fed biotech grains .

24 .
but the emergence of the left party as a political force to be seriously reckoned with is already causing turbulence in german politics . incumbent mayor ole von beust of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate michael naumann , a former federal culture secretary , are squaring off in the race to head up hamburg 's senate . but polls show neither of the city-state 's biggest parties can count on bringing home the lion 's share of the votes on sunday or even have enough support to form a majority government with their preferred political partners . instead , the left party - a relative newcomer on the german political scene - may be on its way to a third-place finish , ahead of the greens and the free-market liberal fdp .
" without us it would be deadly boring in -lsb- hamburg 's parliament -rsb- , " said top left party politician gregor gysi at an election rally in the port city on wednesday .
social agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's most important port currently the left party is n't even represented in hamburg 's parliament , in which the cdu has an absolute majority and the spd and greens , called gal in hamburg , are in the opposition .
but there 's no doubt that the left party will be part of hamburg 's parliament after sunday .
recent polls predicted the party would receive up to 9 percent of the vote , putting it shoulder-to-shoulder with the greens , while the fdp 's share hovers around 5 percent , the barrier for entry into the assembly .
forecasts put the cdu at 40 percent and the spd at 35 percent .
school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor are among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice .
that tack seems to have paid off , particularly with the arrest on monday of deutsche post chief klaus zumwinkel for alleged tax evasion , which has fired up an angry discussion in germany about the country 's super-rich .
a burgeoning political force until recently , the left - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - had been a political factor only in the country 's eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is a new political force in germany however , it swept into the western state parliaments of lower saxony and hesse on jan .
27 , signaling a breakthrough that is helping it increase its foothold .
it 's now part of eight of germany 's 16 state parliaments , and on the federal level , it 's got over 50 parliamentarians in the 614-member bundestag . " the success of the left have recognizably altered the discussions on policy in the other parties , " said renate koecher of the allensbach institute for public opinion research . " the efforts of the spd to re-establish itself with leftist positions ... have brought it little benefit but have rather strengthened the left , " she said .
beust and naumann have both rejected even considering entering into coalition talks with the left .
the cdu hopes to be in the position to rule with the fdp , but it may only have the chance to create a coalition with the stronger greens .
the social democrats , on the other hand , would definitely prefer to work with the greens , but forecasts indicate their only chance to be part of the government would be in tandem with their archrivals in the cdu .
spanners from the left at least one other thing unites cdu and spd : both are anxious to avoid the debacle that hesse experienced after its jan .
27 state election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could become the third-biggest group in hamburg 's parliament after a dramatically divisive election campaign gave the cdu and spd almost the same share of the poll , the two parties have been in limbo , unwilling to form a coalition together at the same time as they are unable to create a majority government without making compromises .
the left party 's entry into parliament spoiled their election arithmetic .
the cdu and spd in hesse have rejected cooperation with the left .
but media reported earlier this week that the state 's social democrats , under potential premier andrea ypsilanti , were starting to consider the option of heading up a minority government along with the greens and with the explicit backing of the left party . the spd , however , has vehemently denied these reports . " there will be no agreements of any kind with the left , not even toleration , " said spd chief kurt beck . unreliable partners ? the social democratic misgivings about the left party were confirmed as recently as last week , when christel wegner , a communist who was elected to the lower saxony legislature in january on the left ticket , defended the berlin wall and the discredited east german security service , the stasi , on national television . this was too much even for the left , who promptly threw her out . although the atmosphere in hamburg is n't close to being as polarized as in hesse , the vote is still unlikely to provide obvious answers , and neither the candidates themselves , nor political analysts are placing bets on any horse . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "

the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .
a strategy to win customer loyalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small stores can not compete with organic supermarkets like this one for many food retailers , the image associated with organic food is more important than the profits that they earn .
" it is a form of advertising that encourages customer loyalty .
i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .
over the next few weeks , it will become clear if the storeowner will be forced to give up his business .
murmann is n't optimistic .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks when washington is suspected of having transferred terrorism suspects to a network of cia prisons outside the us . human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . eu still awaiting replies eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told a daily news briefing on friday , feb .
22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .
29 last month , to which the eu still has not received an adequate response , laitenberger said . " they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue .

24 .
but the emergence of the left party as a political force to be seriously reckoned with is already causing turbulence in german politics . incumbent mayor ole von beust of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate michael naumann , a former federal culture secretary , are squaring off in the race to head up hamburg 's senate . but polls show neither of the city-state 's biggest parties can count on bringing home the lion 's share of the votes on sunday or even have enough support to form a majority government with their preferred political partners . instead , the left party - a relative newcomer on the german political scene - may be on its way to a third-place finish , ahead of the greens and the free-market liberal fdp .
" without us it would be deadly boring in -lsb- hamburg 's parliament -rsb- , " said top left party politician gregor gysi at an election rally in the port city on wednesday .
social agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's most important port currently the left party is n't even represented in hamburg 's parliament , in which the cdu has an absolute majority and the spd and greens , called gal in hamburg , are in the opposition .
but there 's no doubt that the left party will be part of hamburg 's parliament after sunday .
recent polls predicted the party would receive up to 9 percent of the vote , putting it shoulder-to-shoulder with the greens , while the fdp 's share hovers around 5 percent , the barrier for entry into the assembly .
forecasts put the cdu at 40 percent and the spd at 35 percent .
school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor are among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice .
that tack seems to have paid off , particularly with the arrest on monday of deutsche post chief klaus zumwinkel for alleged tax evasion , which has fired up an angry discussion in germany about the country 's super-rich .
a burgeoning political force until recently , the left - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - had been a political factor only in the country 's eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is a new political force in germany however , it swept into the western state parliaments of lower saxony and hesse on jan .
27 , signaling a breakthrough that is helping it increase its foothold .
it 's now part of eight of germany 's 16 state parliaments , and on the federal level , it 's got over 50 parliamentarians in the 614-member bundestag . " the success of the left have recognizably altered the discussions on policy in the other parties , " said renate koecher of the allensbach institute for public opinion research . " the efforts of the spd to re-establish itself with leftist positions ... have brought it little benefit but have rather strengthened the left , " she said .
beust and naumann have both rejected even considering entering into coalition talks with the left .
the cdu hopes to be in the position to rule with the fdp , but it may only have the chance to create a coalition with the stronger greens .
the social democrats , on the other hand , would definitely prefer to work with the greens , but forecasts indicate their only chance to be part of the government would be in tandem with their archrivals in the cdu .
spanners from the left at least one other thing unites cdu and spd : both are anxious to avoid the debacle that hesse experienced after its jan .
27 state election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could become the third-biggest group in hamburg 's parliament after a dramatically divisive election campaign gave the cdu and spd almost the same share of the poll , the two parties have been in limbo , unwilling to form a coalition together at the same time as they are unable to create a majority government without making compromises .
the left party 's entry into parliament spoiled their election arithmetic .
the cdu and spd in hesse have rejected cooperation with the left .
but media reported earlier this week that the state 's social democrats , under potential premier andrea ypsilanti , were starting to consider the option of heading up a minority government along with the greens and with the explicit backing of the left party . the spd , however , has vehemently denied these reports . " there will be no agreements of any kind with the left , not even toleration , " said spd chief kurt beck . unreliable partners ? the social democratic misgivings about the left party were confirmed as recently as last week , when christel wegner , a communist who was elected to the lower saxony legislature in january on the left ticket , defended the berlin wall and the discredited east german security service , the stasi , on national television . this was too much even for the left , who promptly threw her out . although the atmosphere in hamburg is n't close to being as polarized as in hesse , the vote is still unlikely to provide obvious answers , and neither the candidates themselves , nor political analysts are placing bets on any horse . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .
the study director said online portals may even become more popular than television at some point . sarah mersch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "

you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .

i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .
a strategy to win customer loyalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small stores can not compete with organic supermarkets like this one for many food retailers , the image associated with organic food is more important than the profits that they earn .
" it is a form of advertising that encourages customer loyalty .
i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .
over the next few weeks , it will become clear if the storeowner will be forced to give up his business .
murmann is n't optimistic .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .

the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .

" they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .

the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "

the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .

" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .

it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .

that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .

22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .

" they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue .

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !
it 's supposed to be a really beautiful city .
maybe i 'll come for oktoberfest .
i 'd also like to take a boat trip on the rhine river , from the swiss border to the dutch border . what i like best about germany : as a dane , it 's easy traveling in germany because i do n't have any language problems .
most danes speak german .
compared to denmark , everything is much cheaper here , especially eating out .

click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .

click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !

click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !
it 's supposed to be a really beautiful city .
maybe i 'll come for oktoberfest .
i 'd also like to take a boat trip on the rhine river , from the swiss border to the dutch border . what i like best about germany : as a dane , it 's easy traveling in germany because i do n't have any language problems .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks when washington is suspected of having transferred terrorism suspects to a network of cia prisons outside the us . human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . eu still awaiting replies eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told a daily news briefing on friday , feb .
22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .
29 last month , to which the eu still has not received an adequate response , laitenberger said . " they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue . " fava told reuters his efforts so far to follow-up on that report in the light of new evidence , and reopen the investigation have been opposed by some european lawmakers and governments , including portugal , germany and britain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
" we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
one rotten apple bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one rotten apple does not spoil the barrel , says merkel german chancellor angela merkel , in her weekly podcast said on saturday that people were right to be outraged about the tax evasion affair .
at the same time , however , she cautioned against attacking all successful wealth creators , including company owners and managers , calling them an essential part of the german economy . " we should not lose sight of this in the wider discussion , " she said .
most germans accepted their responsibility as individuals to society in general , merkel said .
but she added : " a few still have to learn this , and the state will resort to its powers in these cases . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .

recent polls predicted the party would receive up to 9 percent of the vote , putting it shoulder-to-shoulder with the greens , while the fdp 's share hovers around 5 percent , the barrier for entry into the assembly .
forecasts put the cdu at 40 percent and the spd at 35 percent .
school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor are among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice .

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .

24 .
but the emergence of the left party as a political force to be seriously reckoned with is already causing turbulence in german politics . incumbent mayor ole von beust of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate michael naumann , a former federal culture secretary , are squaring off in the race to head up hamburg 's senate . but polls show neither of the city-state 's biggest parties can count on bringing home the lion 's share of the votes on sunday or even have enough support to form a majority government with their preferred political partners . instead , the left party - a relative newcomer on the german political scene - may be on its way to a third-place finish , ahead of the greens and the free-market liberal fdp .
" without us it would be deadly boring in -lsb- hamburg 's parliament -rsb- , " said top left party politician gregor gysi at an election rally in the port city on wednesday .
social agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's most important port currently the left party is n't even represented in hamburg 's parliament , in which the cdu has an absolute majority and the spd and greens , called gal in hamburg , are in the opposition .
but there 's no doubt that the left party will be part of hamburg 's parliament after sunday .
recent polls predicted the party would receive up to 9 percent of the vote , putting it shoulder-to-shoulder with the greens , while the fdp 's share hovers around 5 percent , the barrier for entry into the assembly .
forecasts put the cdu at 40 percent and the spd at 35 percent .
school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor are among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice .
that tack seems to have paid off , particularly with the arrest on monday of deutsche post chief klaus zumwinkel for alleged tax evasion , which has fired up an angry discussion in germany about the country 's super-rich .
a burgeoning political force until recently , the left - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - had been a political factor only in the country 's eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is a new political force in germany however , it swept into the western state parliaments of lower saxony and hesse on jan .
27 , signaling a breakthrough that is helping it increase its foothold .
it 's now part of eight of germany 's 16 state parliaments , and on the federal level , it 's got over 50 parliamentarians in the 614-member bundestag . " the success of the left have recognizably altered the discussions on policy in the other parties , " said renate koecher of the allensbach institute for public opinion research . " the efforts of the spd to re-establish itself with leftist positions ... have brought it little benefit but have rather strengthened the left , " she said .
beust and naumann have both rejected even considering entering into coalition talks with the left .
the cdu hopes to be in the position to rule with the fdp , but it may only have the chance to create a coalition with the stronger greens .
the social democrats , on the other hand , would definitely prefer to work with the greens , but forecasts indicate their only chance to be part of the government would be in tandem with their archrivals in the cdu .
spanners from the left at least one other thing unites cdu and spd : both are anxious to avoid the debacle that hesse experienced after its jan .
27 state election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could become the third-biggest group in hamburg 's parliament after a dramatically divisive election campaign gave the cdu and spd almost the same share of the poll , the two parties have been in limbo , unwilling to form a coalition together at the same time as they are unable to create a majority government without making compromises .
the left party 's entry into parliament spoiled their election arithmetic .
the cdu and spd in hesse have rejected cooperation with the left .
but media reported earlier this week that the state 's social democrats , under potential premier andrea ypsilanti , were starting to consider the option of heading up a minority government along with the greens and with the explicit backing of the left party . the spd , however , has vehemently denied these reports . " there will be no agreements of any kind with the left , not even toleration , " said spd chief kurt beck . unreliable partners ? the social democratic misgivings about the left party were confirmed as recently as last week , when christel wegner , a communist who was elected to the lower saxony legislature in january on the left ticket , defended the berlin wall and the discredited east german security service , the stasi , on national television . this was too much even for the left , who promptly threw her out . although the atmosphere in hamburg is n't close to being as polarized as in hesse , the vote is still unlikely to provide obvious answers , and neither the candidates themselves , nor political analysts are placing bets on any horse . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

have you been to germany too ?
click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !
it 's supposed to be a really beautiful city .
maybe i 'll come for oktoberfest .
i 'd also like to take a boat trip on the rhine river , from the swiss border to the dutch border . what i like best about germany : as a dane , it 's easy traveling in germany because i do n't have any language problems .
most danes speak german .
compared to denmark , everything is much cheaper here , especially eating out .
i like that germany is so big and diverse , with changing landscapes and beautiful cities .
i 'd also like to visit hamburg , berlin and bonn . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks when washington is suspected of having transferred terrorism suspects to a network of cia prisons outside the us . human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . eu still awaiting replies eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told a daily news briefing on friday , feb .
22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .
29 last month , to which the eu still has not received an adequate response , laitenberger said . " they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue . " fava told reuters his efforts so far to follow-up on that report in the light of new evidence , and reopen the investigation have been opposed by some european lawmakers and governments , including portugal , germany and britain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
" we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
one rotten apple bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one rotten apple does not spoil the barrel , says merkel german chancellor angela merkel , in her weekly podcast said on saturday that people were right to be outraged about the tax evasion affair .
at the same time , however , she cautioned against attacking all successful wealth creators , including company owners and managers , calling them an essential part of the german economy . " we should not lose sight of this in the wider discussion , " she said .
most germans accepted their responsibility as individuals to society in general , merkel said .
but she added : " a few still have to learn this , and the state will resort to its powers in these cases . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
" we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
one rotten apple bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one rotten apple does not spoil the barrel , says merkel german chancellor angela merkel , in her weekly podcast said on saturday that people were right to be outraged about the tax evasion affair .
at the same time , however , she cautioned against attacking all successful wealth creators , including company owners and managers , calling them an essential part of the german economy . " we should not lose sight of this in the wider discussion , " she said .
most germans accepted their responsibility as individuals to society in general , merkel said .
but she added : " a few still have to learn this , and the state will resort to its powers in these cases . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.02.2008 germany wants broader tax-haven crackdown in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has less money on hand because of tax havens such as liechtenstein germany could limit business with liechtenstein and include other european countries in its efforts to crack down on tax-havens , said finance minister peer steinbrueck in an interview released on saturday , dec .
23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .

22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .

" they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue . " fava told reuters his efforts so far to follow-up on that report in the light of new evidence , and reopen the investigation have been opposed by some european lawmakers and governments , including portugal , germany and britain . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .

the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .

22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .

" they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.02.2008 germany wants broader tax-haven crackdown in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has less money on hand because of tax havens such as liechtenstein germany could limit business with liechtenstein and include other european countries in its efforts to crack down on tax-havens , said finance minister peer steinbrueck in an interview released on saturday , dec .
23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.02.2008 organic food pioneers lose out to big business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic is everywhere - even pretzels have to be healthy nowadays germany 's organic food industry enjoyed a boom year in 2007 .
turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .
a strategy to win customer loyalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small stores can not compete with organic supermarkets like this one for many food retailers , the image associated with organic food is more important than the profits that they earn .
" it is a form of advertising that encourages customer loyalty .
i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .
over the next few weeks , it will become clear if the storeowner will be forced to give up his business .
murmann is n't optimistic .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .
" when we started out , we wanted to change farming and to change business practices .
we did n't want supermarkets built on greenfield sites . "
trend towards one stop shops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic yoghurt , bread , tea ...
you name it , most german supermarkets have it . " the customer wants to get everything from one store , " said andreas gerber from the federation of ecological food industry .
" first and foremost , it 's the chain storeowners with the ability to set up big , new branches who are profiting from the organic food boom .
or the stores who can expand their sales area , " gerber said . " but this is not an option for most small organic shops that are located in built-up residential areas . "
in the past , customers had to go out of their way to obtain organic products , but now they are stocked in most supermarkets .
that 's fatal for small stores .
" a whole series of small organic shops have had to close , " said gerber .
by contrast , 80 organic supermarkets opened their doors last year in germany .
the rewe group , one of europe 's biggest food retailers , has also gone with the flow , selling organic products from its supermarkets .
it even opened up its own chain dedicated to selling ecologically grown products , called " vier linden . " company spokesman andreas krämer said the group was planning to open two or three branches a year .
" we want to continue expanding " vierlinden " because the brand is definitely worthwhile - both from the point of view of our experiences with customers and from the point of view of image , " said krämer .
a strategy to win customer loyalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small stores can not compete with organic supermarkets like this one for many food retailers , the image associated with organic food is more important than the profits that they earn .
" it is a form of advertising that encourages customer loyalty .
i think that some of the products , particularly in the discount supermarkets , are cross-subsidized by conventional products , " said gerber .
that 's the kind of thing that only large retailers can afford .
and small business owner ralf murmann conceded that supermarket products , per se , are n't any worse . " some of our suppliers also sell to lidl , aldi or dm under a different brand name .
so you ca n't say that the quality is any different . " but murmann nevertheless finds it paradoxical that pioneers like him are losing out now that organic food has become truly popular .
" the people profiting from organic food are those people who ruined food products in the first place - the budget supermarket chains .
they 're the reason why we set up organic food stores in the first place , " he said .
over the next few weeks , it will become clear if the storeowner will be forced to give up his business .

the eu is urging romania and poland to respond to charges that they hosted cia jails . a day after london said the us had confirmed using british territory to transport suspected terrorists on secret flights , the european commission said poland and romania needed to clarify their roles in the us extraordinary rendition program . the term " extraordinary rendition " has been used to describe the secret transport of prisoners from one country or jurisdiction to another without formal extradition proceedings .
the practice gained notoriety after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks when washington is suspected of having transferred terrorism suspects to a network of cia prisons outside the us . human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . eu still awaiting replies eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told a daily news briefing on friday , feb .
22 , that eu justice commissioner franco frattini had renewed an appeal to warsaw and bucharest to respond to a council of europe report last year that said detention centers in the two countries were used to question leading al qaeda suspects from 2003 to 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania country has not shed light on its role in the cia jails affair frattini sent the two countries letters last july and reminders on jan .

" they -lrb- the letters -rrb- reminded the two countries … of the obligation to carry out effective investigations and asked for detailed information as to how this has been implemented and in particular what the outcome of the investigation is , " he added . romania and poland have both strongly denied allegations of running secret cia prisons on their territories or aiding the us to hustle terror suspects into illegal detention facilities . swiss politician dick marty , who authored the council of europe report , said poland and romania hosted secret jails under a special cia program created after the sept .
11 attacks " to kill , capture and detain " terrorism suspects considered of " high value . " marty said poland had held some of the cia 's most sensitive prisoners , including khalid sheikh mohammed , alleged mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks . angry protests in britain the us extraordinary rendition program is deemed illegal under eu human rights laws and has sparked heated debate in europe in recent years .
many eu member states have been unwilling to come clean on their involvement in aiding the us with renditions by offering their airspace or bases for refueling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few eu nations are suspected of hosting cia jails on their soil british foreign secretary david miliband prompted angry protests from members of parliament in london and from british human rights groups when he said the us had confirmed using the british-ruled island of diego garcia in the indian ocean for the refueling of two american rendition flights carrying terrorist suspects in 2002 . the british government , washington 's leading ally in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , has repeatedly said in recent years that it knew of no american rendition flights involving british airspace or airfields and had no reason to doubt the denials by washington that any such flights had taken place . in nov , 2006 , the european parliament committee said in a draft report that 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe .
the list included countries such as germany and italy . " a moral duty " claudio fava , who led the european parliament 's investigation , told reuters news agency on friday that the eu needed to follow up on the latest developments in britain . " yesterday 's revelations confirm that the european parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry , " fava said . " … we still do n't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue .

turnover rose 15 percent , an increase of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .
but that 's not good news for everyone in the business . organic food store owner ralf murmann has been running his business in bonn for 33 years .
profit was never his sole motive .
but in the past , he was able to make a living from the shop .
now , with the trend towards organic food booming in germany , his store is on the brink of closure .
" we are not profiting from this boom .
shops of this size are the losers in this development , " said murmann .
he stocks the same kind of yoghurts as the same organic supermarket two kilometres away .
his store also has a big cheese counter , freshly baked bread , fruit and vegetables from local farmers .
but murmann 's customers have been dwindling since ever more conventional supermarkets started to stock organic products .
" organic is not just about labels , " murmann said .

24 .
but the emergence of the left party as a political force to be seriously reckoned with is already causing turbulence in german politics . incumbent mayor ole von beust of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate michael naumann , a former federal culture secretary , are squaring off in the race to head up hamburg 's senate . but polls show neither of the city-state 's biggest parties can count on bringing home the lion 's share of the votes on sunday or even have enough support to form a majority government with their preferred political partners . instead , the left party - a relative newcomer on the german political scene - may be on its way to a third-place finish , ahead of the greens and the free-market liberal fdp .
" without us it would be deadly boring in -lsb- hamburg 's parliament -rsb- , " said top left party politician gregor gysi at an election rally in the port city on wednesday .
social agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's most important port currently the left party is n't even represented in hamburg 's parliament , in which the cdu has an absolute majority and the spd and greens , called gal in hamburg , are in the opposition .
but there 's no doubt that the left party will be part of hamburg 's parliament after sunday .
recent polls predicted the party would receive up to 9 percent of the vote , putting it shoulder-to-shoulder with the greens , while the fdp 's share hovers around 5 percent , the barrier for entry into the assembly .
forecasts put the cdu at 40 percent and the spd at 35 percent .
school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor are among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice .
that tack seems to have paid off , particularly with the arrest on monday of deutsche post chief klaus zumwinkel for alleged tax evasion , which has fired up an angry discussion in germany about the country 's super-rich .
a burgeoning political force until recently , the left - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - had been a political factor only in the country 's eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is a new political force in germany however , it swept into the western state parliaments of lower saxony and hesse on jan .
27 , signaling a breakthrough that is helping it increase its foothold .
it 's now part of eight of germany 's 16 state parliaments , and on the federal level , it 's got over 50 parliamentarians in the 614-member bundestag . " the success of the left have recognizably altered the discussions on policy in the other parties , " said renate koecher of the allensbach institute for public opinion research . " the efforts of the spd to re-establish itself with leftist positions ... have brought it little benefit but have rather strengthened the left , " she said .
beust and naumann have both rejected even considering entering into coalition talks with the left .
the cdu hopes to be in the position to rule with the fdp , but it may only have the chance to create a coalition with the stronger greens .
the social democrats , on the other hand , would definitely prefer to work with the greens , but forecasts indicate their only chance to be part of the government would be in tandem with their archrivals in the cdu .
spanners from the left at least one other thing unites cdu and spd : both are anxious to avoid the debacle that hesse experienced after its jan .
27 state election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could become the third-biggest group in hamburg 's parliament after a dramatically divisive election campaign gave the cdu and spd almost the same share of the poll , the two parties have been in limbo , unwilling to form a coalition together at the same time as they are unable to create a majority government without making compromises .
the left party 's entry into parliament spoiled their election arithmetic .
the cdu and spd in hesse have rejected cooperation with the left .
but media reported earlier this week that the state 's social democrats , under potential premier andrea ypsilanti , were starting to consider the option of heading up a minority government along with the greens and with the explicit backing of the left party . the spd , however , has vehemently denied these reports . " there will be no agreements of any kind with the left , not even toleration , " said spd chief kurt beck . unreliable partners ? the social democratic misgivings about the left party were confirmed as recently as last week , when christel wegner , a communist who was elected to the lower saxony legislature in january on the left ticket , defended the berlin wall and the discredited east german security service , the stasi , on national television . this was too much even for the left , who promptly threw her out . although the atmosphere in hamburg is n't close to being as polarized as in hesse , the vote is still unlikely to provide obvious answers , and neither the candidates themselves , nor political analysts are placing bets on any horse . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.02.2008 germany wants broader tax-haven crackdown in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has less money on hand because of tax havens such as liechtenstein germany could limit business with liechtenstein and include other european countries in its efforts to crack down on tax-havens , said finance minister peer steinbrueck in an interview released on saturday , dec .
23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
" we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
one rotten apple bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one rotten apple does not spoil the barrel , says merkel german chancellor angela merkel , in her weekly podcast said on saturday that people were right to be outraged about the tax evasion affair .
at the same time , however , she cautioned against attacking all successful wealth creators , including company owners and managers , calling them an essential part of the german economy . " we should not lose sight of this in the wider discussion , " she said .
most germans accepted their responsibility as individuals to society in general , merkel said .
but she added : " a few still have to learn this , and the state will resort to its powers in these cases . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .

he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .

the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

23 . german officials are urging liechtenstein to increase the transparency of its financial system amid a large-scale investigation into money that well-heeled germans allegedly stashed in the alpine tax haven .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck is not mincing his words when talking about tax evasion " we aim to declare war on tax havens in europe , " steinbrueck told the sunday edition of the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
the downfall of klaus zumwinkel - the high-profile boss of deutsche post and one of the country 's most prominent businessmen - and the exposure of the foundations he and other wealthy germans are using in liechtenstein to hide their income has raised a furore .
the angry defence of its banking practices mounted by prince alois , the alpine principality 's regent , has elicited universal scorn in the german media .
" we would like to conclude a double taxation agreement with liechtenstein , " steinbrueck was quoted as saying .
" but if we do not make progress there , we must take other measures at european or german level .
i am thinking of the possibility of making business dealings with liechtenstein considerably more difficult . "
german trade with liechtenstein totalled 836 million euros -lrb- $ 1.24 billion -rrb- in 2006 , according to germany 's federal statistics office .
a wider problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could make business dealings with liechtenstein more difficult the problem of tax evasion , however , is not limited to the tiny principality which is sandwiched between austria and switzerland .
" we are also talking about switzerland , about luxembourg and about austria , " steinbrueck said .
the list is , in fact , even longer .
chancellor angela merkel 's spokesman made clear on friday that tax evasion would be high on the agenda when monaco 's prince albert ii visits this coming week .
german officials repeatedly cite the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which characterizes andorra , liechtenstein and monaco as " uncooperative " when it comes to financial transparency and unfair tax competition .
spotlight on german private banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does not want to allow its citizens to park their cash elsewhere germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung reported on thursday , feb .
21 , that several private banks and other financial institutions in germany helped to administer around 50 anonymous foundations for its rich clients in liechtenstein .
the newspaper did not name its sources .
the report was confirmed by bernd bieniossek , the leading state prosecutor in the city of bochum who told german public broadcaster ard 's news web site that investigators were indeed looking into the role played by german private banks .
the daily said german customers of several banks were explicitly advised about the foundations in liechtenstein , adding that in some cases millions were transferred to accounts in vaduz using code words .
guenther oettinger , premier of the western german state of baden-wuerttemberg , told news agency dpa that the newspaper report was plausible .
" we need to examine the allegations , " oettinger said .
one rotten apple bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one rotten apple does not spoil the barrel , says merkel german chancellor angela merkel , in her weekly podcast said on saturday that people were right to be outraged about the tax evasion affair .
at the same time , however , she cautioned against attacking all successful wealth creators , including company owners and managers , calling them an essential part of the german economy . " we should not lose sight of this in the wider discussion , " she said .
most germans accepted their responsibility as individuals to society in general , merkel said .
but she added : " a few still have to learn this , and the state will resort to its powers in these cases . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .
the study director said online portals may even become more popular than television at some point . sarah mersch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're not interested in fancy features . there are internet communities out there for new mothers , dog lovers , lacrosse fans , amateur photographers and just about any other niche group you can think of .
web portals are easy to set up and they 're rapidly multiplying around the world . most users join to communicate with friends .
but many of the other possibilities - like evaluating books , adding to blogs or commenting on photos , for example - are rarely taken advantage of , said internet expert jens boecker from the bonn-rhein-sieg university of applied sciences . in a survey of online community members , boecker took a deeper look at user behavior .
he found that providers misjudge their customers and often offer functions that the users are n't interested in . forgetful users like birthday reminder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did you go to school with this guy ?
he might be looking for you " the abundance of features overwhelms the user , " he said , comparing online portals to fancy cell phones with hundreds of functions .
people are looking for a community that is easy to navigate so they can find information quickly , added boecker - whether it 's parenting tips , pictures of poodle haircuts or diagrams of leg stretches for lacrosse players . one of the most beloved online features , according to the study , is a virtual birthday calendar .
seventy percent of those questioned said it was , alongside the protection of their private sphere , one of the most important elements - a result which surprised the researcher .
these two features ranked ahead of search functions and current content on the home page . so why do n't all the providers just get rid of the superfluous features if they do n't interest users ?
on the competitive market , said boecker , the providers use a kind of shot-gun strategy to set themselves apart from the others with special traits , even if they go unused . " it 's a matter of trial-and-error , " he said .
" the providers throw a whole pile of possibilities at the community and then they have to see what actually works . " users want virtual contact to real people the average user has one priority , according to the study : keeping in touch with friends - that is , real-life friends .
they 're not necessarily interested in making new acquaintances . studivz , germany 's version of facebook , for example , mainly serves as a way for users to come in contact with old friends from school or college .
reporting some five millions users , the portal has become extremely popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most portals require setting up a personal profile while studivz may have picked up on this one market demand , boecker said he thinks other providers overestimate their users ' interest in meeting new people . members turned off by fees and ads apparently , many portals also go down the wrong path when it comes to earning money .
the smaller ones , often managed out of the founder 's home , tend to charge a fee for membership .
sixty percent of those surveyed said fees were a no-go criterion for them , which leads boecker to believe that these portals wo n't last long . the larger ones are usually financed by advertisers , but many users said they were n't particularly keen on blinking ads and annoying pop-ups .
even studivz recently came under fire for allowing personalized ads . boecker said he doubts whether the giant portal will survive over the long term for this reason . but even if some communities are short-lived , others will learn from their experiences and continue to fill the mass demand for entertainment with niche products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 23.02.2008 hamburg elections likely to strengthen germany 's far left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither of the two biggest mainstream parties can expect a satisfying result no clear winner is expected in the hamburg state elections on sunday , feb .
24 .
but the emergence of the left party as a political force to be seriously reckoned with is already causing turbulence in german politics . incumbent mayor ole von beust of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate michael naumann , a former federal culture secretary , are squaring off in the race to head up hamburg 's senate . but polls show neither of the city-state 's biggest parties can count on bringing home the lion 's share of the votes on sunday or even have enough support to form a majority government with their preferred political partners . instead , the left party - a relative newcomer on the german political scene - may be on its way to a third-place finish , ahead of the greens and the free-market liberal fdp .
" without us it would be deadly boring in -lsb- hamburg 's parliament -rsb- , " said top left party politician gregor gysi at an election rally in the port city on wednesday .
social agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg has germany 's most important port currently the left party is n't even represented in hamburg 's parliament , in which the cdu has an absolute majority and the spd and greens , called gal in hamburg , are in the opposition .
but there 's no doubt that the left party will be part of hamburg 's parliament after sunday .
recent polls predicted the party would receive up to 9 percent of the vote , putting it shoulder-to-shoulder with the greens , while the fdp 's share hovers around 5 percent , the barrier for entry into the assembly .
forecasts put the cdu at 40 percent and the spd at 35 percent .
school reform , environmental policy and expanding the harbor are among the top campaign issues , and the left has managed to garner support with its stress on social justice .
that tack seems to have paid off , particularly with the arrest on monday of deutsche post chief klaus zumwinkel for alleged tax evasion , which has fired up an angry discussion in germany about the country 's super-rich .
a burgeoning political force until recently , the left - a far-left grouping which came out of a merger of a social democratic splinter group and the successor party to the former east german communists - had been a political factor only in the country 's eastern states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is a new political force in germany however , it swept into the western state parliaments of lower saxony and hesse on jan .
27 , signaling a breakthrough that is helping it increase its foothold .
it 's now part of eight of germany 's 16 state parliaments , and on the federal level , it 's got over 50 parliamentarians in the 614-member bundestag . " the success of the left have recognizably altered the discussions on policy in the other parties , " said renate koecher of the allensbach institute for public opinion research . " the efforts of the spd to re-establish itself with leftist positions ... have brought it little benefit but have rather strengthened the left , " she said .
beust and naumann have both rejected even considering entering into coalition talks with the left .
the cdu hopes to be in the position to rule with the fdp , but it may only have the chance to create a coalition with the stronger greens .
the social democrats , on the other hand , would definitely prefer to work with the greens , but forecasts indicate their only chance to be part of the government would be in tandem with their archrivals in the cdu .
spanners from the left at least one other thing unites cdu and spd : both are anxious to avoid the debacle that hesse experienced after its jan .
27 state election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could become the third-biggest group in hamburg 's parliament after a dramatically divisive election campaign gave the cdu and spd almost the same share of the poll , the two parties have been in limbo , unwilling to form a coalition together at the same time as they are unable to create a majority government without making compromises .
the left party 's entry into parliament spoiled their election arithmetic .
the cdu and spd in hesse have rejected cooperation with the left .
but media reported earlier this week that the state 's social democrats , under potential premier andrea ypsilanti , were starting to consider the option of heading up a minority government along with the greens and with the explicit backing of the left party . the spd , however , has vehemently denied these reports . " there will be no agreements of any kind with the left , not even toleration , " said spd chief kurt beck . unreliable partners ? the social democratic misgivings about the left party were confirmed as recently as last week , when christel wegner , a communist who was elected to the lower saxony legislature in january on the left ticket , defended the berlin wall and the discredited east german security service , the stasi , on national television . this was too much even for the left , who promptly threw her out . although the atmosphere in hamburg is n't close to being as polarized as in hesse , the vote is still unlikely to provide obvious answers , and neither the candidates themselves , nor political analysts are placing bets on any horse . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

have you been to germany too ?
click on the link below to tell us about your trip . helle horsten is a retiree from helsingor , denmark . my favorite destination in germany : moselle river my preferred accommodation : in the historisches gästehaus in bullay on the moselle river .
the house , which is landmarked as a historical building , belonged to nobility in the 16th century and was renovated several years ago .
the atmosphere is quaint , the breakfast is elaborate , the innkeepers are very helpful and sometimes the guests even wake up to hand organ music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helle horsten recommends sampling " federweißen " on the moselle river a perfect day on the moselle river : i wake up rested and , after a light breakfast , make my way along the river , either on foot , by bike or - weather permitting - by boat .
from bullay , i would visit the picturesque village of beilstein .
from the castle ruins at a peak high above the city , i can get a fantastic view of the moselle .
after taking a break in the castle restaurant , i would probably go to cochem to shop , since there are lots of nice stores there .
if there is a wine festival going on in or around bullay , which is often the case in the fall , then of course i would go there in the evening and try the new wine - " federweißen . " i tend to spend my money on : restaurants , transportation , entrance fees . my tip : everyone wants to bring back souvenirs .
in germany , it 's worth looking out for local specialties .
each region has its own products .
in cochem , for example , you can buy really nice wine or schnapps .
everyone back home is bound to like that ! where i want to visit next : munich !
it 's supposed to be a really beautiful city .
maybe i 'll come for oktoberfest .
i 'd also like to take a boat trip on the rhine river , from the swiss border to the dutch border . what i like best about germany : as a dane , it 's easy traveling in germany because i do n't have any language problems .
most danes speak german .

but his first game made under a multi-project arrangement with electronic arts , called boom blox , is a family-friendly puzzler for the nintendo wii .
" the first assumption is big , epic game ... yadda yadda .
-lsb- it 's -rsb- not the game , " says louis castle , who has worked closely with spielberg to develop the title .
" but it 's so not that product that the moment you see it , you know what you are in for .
" steven has a multi-project deal with us and without giving too much away , there are projects much more in line with people 's expectations , but those take a long time to make . "
spielberg got involved with ea because , says castle , he is a gamer .
" he is a very big game player - not a lot of people know that .
he loves playing games .
the game is a 3d puzzle action title " he wanted to make them with some people he could trust .
it seemed like a great partnership . "
spielberg was inspired to make a title for the wii after playing on the console with legendary nintendo developer shigeru miyamoto .
" he wanted to play a game he could play with his friends and family .
" he came to us with idea for the game and has been working with us on a weekly basis , overseeing the development of the game and working with me personally on the product .
" it 's been a great kick . "
despite his commitment to film-making , both directing and producing titles , spielberg has been dedicated to the development process .
" steven will come in and tell us : ' these are kind of ideas i 'd like to get to ' .
" we brainstorm about what that might be , we might do some quick drawings on a whiteboard and then he goes away and does his stuff like making movies and saving the world .
steve 's instinct on people is incredible louis castle " a week later we review the progress we have made and talk about what we do next .
it 's literally a very iterative process and we work very closely together . "
boom blox uses the wii 's innovative controller to give players freedom to wreak havoc in the game .
" steven wanted to make a game where the complexity and challenge of using your brain to look at three dimensional puzzles , and throw objects at it , and knock them over , was intriguing enough for adults to be interested .
" and at the same time this kinetic , visceral feeling would be attractive to children as well . "
castle adds : " as steven would say : ' kids just like to break things ' . "
the development team spent a long time working on the control system for the game .
spielberg came up with the idea of the game " we brought in the best computer scientists and we working on analysing the data you get from the wii remote , " says castle .
" that was actually a very , very difficult problem involving lots of calculus .
" so many wii games record just what the wiimote is doing without much thought about or at least computation about what it was intended by the player .
" we 've put a lot of thought and energy into what was intended by the consumer . "
spielberg 's skill , says castle , is to understand the player .
" more than anything he gets people .
i have made a lot of games , more than a hundred and i am quite accomplished in this field , even i do n't have that kind of instinct .
" steve 's instinct on people is incredible .
he really understands what they are going to say about the game and what they are going to enjoy about it . "
castle is at pains to emphasise that spielberg 's attachment to the game is no marketing hook .
" this collaboration is not about attaching steven 's name to a game to make it sell .
this is a creative collaboration between people in very different entertainment fields trying to make a product that will appeal to a very broad audience .
" we 're making steven 's game and of course he 's going to talk about it because he is excited about his game . "

but his first game made under a multi-project arrangement with electronic arts , called boom blox , is a family-friendly puzzler for the nintendo wii .
" the first assumption is big , epic game ... yadda yadda .
-lsb- it 's -rsb- not the game , " says louis castle , who has worked closely with spielberg to develop the title .
" but it 's so not that product that the moment you see it , you know what you are in for .
" steven has a multi-project deal with us and without giving too much away , there are projects much more in line with people 's expectations , but those take a long time to make . "
spielberg got involved with ea because , says castle , he is a gamer .
" he is a very big game player - not a lot of people know that .
he loves playing games .
the game is a 3d puzzle action title " he wanted to make them with some people he could trust .
it seemed like a great partnership . "
spielberg was inspired to make a title for the wii after playing on the console with legendary nintendo developer shigeru miyamoto .
" he wanted to play a game he could play with his friends and family .
" he came to us with idea for the game and has been working with us on a weekly basis , overseeing the development of the game and working with me personally on the product .
" it 's been a great kick . "
despite his commitment to film-making , both directing and producing titles , spielberg has been dedicated to the development process .
" steven will come in and tell us : ' these are kind of ideas i 'd like to get to ' .
" we brainstorm about what that might be , we might do some quick drawings on a whiteboard and then he goes away and does his stuff like making movies and saving the world .
steve 's instinct on people is incredible louis castle " a week later we review the progress we have made and talk about what we do next .
it 's literally a very iterative process and we work very closely together . "
boom blox uses the wii 's innovative controller to give players freedom to wreak havoc in the game .
" steven wanted to make a game where the complexity and challenge of using your brain to look at three dimensional puzzles , and throw objects at it , and knock them over , was intriguing enough for adults to be interested .
" and at the same time this kinetic , visceral feeling would be attractive to children as well . "
castle adds : " as steven would say : ' kids just like to break things ' . "
the development team spent a long time working on the control system for the game .
spielberg came up with the idea of the game " we brought in the best computer scientists and we working on analysing the data you get from the wii remote , " says castle .
" that was actually a very , very difficult problem involving lots of calculus .
" so many wii games record just what the wiimote is doing without much thought about or at least computation about what it was intended by the player .
" we 've put a lot of thought and energy into what was intended by the consumer . "
spielberg 's skill , says castle , is to understand the player .
" more than anything he gets people .
i have made a lot of games , more than a hundred and i am quite accomplished in this field , even i do n't have that kind of instinct .
" steve 's instinct on people is incredible .
he really understands what they are going to say about the game and what they are going to enjoy about it . "
castle is at pains to emphasise that spielberg 's attachment to the game is no marketing hook .
" this collaboration is not about attaching steven 's name to a game to make it sell .
this is a creative collaboration between people in very different entertainment fields trying to make a product that will appeal to a very broad audience .

spielberg got involved with ea because , says castle , he is a gamer .
" he is a very big game player - not a lot of people know that .
he loves playing games .
the game is a 3d puzzle action title " he wanted to make them with some people he could trust .

spielberg was inspired to make a title for the wii after playing on the console with legendary nintendo developer shigeru miyamoto .

" he came to us with idea for the game and has been working with us on a weekly basis , overseeing the development of the game and working with me personally on the product .

boom blox uses the wii 's innovative controller to give players freedom to wreak havoc in the game .

castle adds : " as steven would say : ' kids just like to break things ' . "
the development team spent a long time working on the control system for the game .
spielberg came up with the idea of the game " we brought in the best computer scientists and we working on analysing the data you get from the wii remote , " says castle .
" that was actually a very , very difficult problem involving lots of calculus .
" so many wii games record just what the wiimote is doing without much thought about or at least computation about what it was intended by the player .

he is the latest in a long line of killers who have targeted prostitutes .
could the police be doing more to protect prostitutes and catch their killers ?
prostitute killers 1888 : jack the ripper killed five women in whitechapel , east london .
unsolved 1964-65 : six women killed and dumped in hammersmith and acton , west london .
unsolved 1975-81 : peter sutcliffe , the yorkshire ripper , kills 13 women - most of them prostitutes - and is jailed for life 1993-94 : lorry driver alun kyte kills two women , whose bodies are discovered in leicestershire 1999 : david smith gets life for murdering amanda walker , six years after being acquitted of killing sarah crump 2008 : steve wright convicted of five murders in ipswich marina monti , karen mcgregor , gail whitehouse , lynne trenholme , natalie pearman , julie finlay , vicky glass , tracy wylde , emma caldwell .
the list goes on and on .
women , often in the grip of drug addiction , who sell their bodies and die at the hands of strangers .
in the past 20 years scores of prostitutes have been murdered in britain and hundreds have been beaten , robbed or raped .
most of these cases remain unsolved .
the victims often have the same sad biographies , marked by drug addiction , which lead them to sell their bodies to fund their habit .
every now and again - the yorkshire ripper , who killed 13 women , most of them prostitutes ; and the ipswich murders - their deaths make the headlines .
but more often than not these killings fail to register with the general public .
in 1996 a nationwide police project , operation enigma , identified 210 unsolved murders of women - many of them prostitutes - which had happened in the previous decade .
two years later they identified 21 " potential clusters " and said they were reopening 70 of the cases .
' human tragedy ' wayne murdock has experienced the frustration of an unsolved murder inquiry .
he was the detective in charge of the investigation into the murder of carol clark , a bristol prostitute whose body was found in sharpness docks , gloucestershire , in march 1993 .
mr murdock , now retired , said : " sometimes members of the public say , ' oh it 's only a prostitute , good riddance , ' but if you started thinking like that , society might as well give up .
she was a human being first and foremost - she was not born to be a prostitute alice wilson " in carol clark 's case i met her parents and they were very decent people and they had no idea what she was doing and it 's just a human tragedy . "
often , if there are no strong leads in the first few weeks , the murder inquiry will be scaled down leaving just a detective , or a small team , who have met the victim 's family and know their grief , to carry on working to obtain justice .
mr murdock said : " it 's not like you see on television .
it 's not easy .
" it takes a heck of a long time , but we have got dna now , which is a huge weapon , and i 'm very confident that some of these cases will be detected and hopefully the carol clark case may be solved in the not too distant future . "
alice wilson 's daughter jacqueline gallagher was killed in glasgow in 1996 and she said the police who investigated her murder were very good .
she told the bbc news website : " they appreciated that she was a human being first and foremost .
she was not born to be a prostitute , but she developed a drug habit .
" but she did not deserve what happened to her .
she had suffered 146 blows to her head and then been strangled . "
lorry driver alun kyte was jailed for life in 2002 for killing two prostitutes the police eventually identified one of jacqueline 's customers as their prime suspect but the case was " not proven " in 2004 .
ms wilson said a conviction would have given her closure , but as it is she remains in a state of emotional " limbo " .
the english collective of prostitutes said most working girls did not report attacks by punters because they did not believe they would be treated seriously by police .
a spokeswoman also claimed sometimes officers could be " brutal " in their approach .
" police often have the attitude , ' oh well what do you expect , it 's part of the job is n't it ? ' if a prostitute is raped or attacked . "
she said she believed the police had put huge resources into investigating the five suffolk murders only because the case had gained much media coverage .
" and the police and the council have since got together to crack down on clients and drive the women out of the red-light district , but they are still working in less safe areas , " she added .
' hatred of women ' she said it was not clear why men attacked prostitutes .
some , like peter sutcliffe , claimed they were " cleaning up the streets " , which the spokeswoman said echoed police rhetoric .
peter sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women others were probably just misogynists who found prostitutes to be easy targets , she added .
mrs wilson agrees : " these people are sick .
maybe it 's a hatred of women .
maybe something has happened in their own lives .
working girls are just the easiest targets because many are on heroin and they will carry on even when there is a killer on the loose because they have to feed their habit . "
she said she knew the pain the parents of the ipswich girls had suffered and added : " i am glad this man has been convicted and i pray for their mothers . "

he is the latest in a long line of killers who have targeted prostitutes .
could the police be doing more to protect prostitutes and catch their killers ?
prostitute killers 1888 : jack the ripper killed five women in whitechapel , east london .
unsolved 1964-65 : six women killed and dumped in hammersmith and acton , west london .
unsolved 1975-81 : peter sutcliffe , the yorkshire ripper , kills 13 women - most of them prostitutes - and is jailed for life 1993-94 : lorry driver alun kyte kills two women , whose bodies are discovered in leicestershire 1999 : david smith gets life for murdering amanda walker , six years after being acquitted of killing sarah crump 2008 : steve wright convicted of five murders in ipswich marina monti , karen mcgregor , gail whitehouse , lynne trenholme , natalie pearman , julie finlay , vicky glass , tracy wylde , emma caldwell .
the list goes on and on .
women , often in the grip of drug addiction , who sell their bodies and die at the hands of strangers .
in the past 20 years scores of prostitutes have been murdered in britain and hundreds have been beaten , robbed or raped .
most of these cases remain unsolved .
the victims often have the same sad biographies , marked by drug addiction , which lead them to sell their bodies to fund their habit .
every now and again - the yorkshire ripper , who killed 13 women , most of them prostitutes ; and the ipswich murders - their deaths make the headlines .
but more often than not these killings fail to register with the general public .
in 1996 a nationwide police project , operation enigma , identified 210 unsolved murders of women - many of them prostitutes - which had happened in the previous decade .
two years later they identified 21 " potential clusters " and said they were reopening 70 of the cases .
' human tragedy ' wayne murdock has experienced the frustration of an unsolved murder inquiry .
he was the detective in charge of the investigation into the murder of carol clark , a bristol prostitute whose body was found in sharpness docks , gloucestershire , in march 1993 .
mr murdock , now retired , said : " sometimes members of the public say , ' oh it 's only a prostitute , good riddance , ' but if you started thinking like that , society might as well give up .
she was a human being first and foremost - she was not born to be a prostitute alice wilson " in carol clark 's case i met her parents and they were very decent people and they had no idea what she was doing and it 's just a human tragedy . "
often , if there are no strong leads in the first few weeks , the murder inquiry will be scaled down leaving just a detective , or a small team , who have met the victim 's family and know their grief , to carry on working to obtain justice .
mr murdock said : " it 's not like you see on television .
it 's not easy .
" it takes a heck of a long time , but we have got dna now , which is a huge weapon , and i 'm very confident that some of these cases will be detected and hopefully the carol clark case may be solved in the not too distant future . "
alice wilson 's daughter jacqueline gallagher was killed in glasgow in 1996 and she said the police who investigated her murder were very good .
she told the bbc news website : " they appreciated that she was a human being first and foremost .
she was not born to be a prostitute , but she developed a drug habit .
" but she did not deserve what happened to her .
she had suffered 146 blows to her head and then been strangled . "
lorry driver alun kyte was jailed for life in 2002 for killing two prostitutes the police eventually identified one of jacqueline 's customers as their prime suspect but the case was " not proven " in 2004 .
ms wilson said a conviction would have given her closure , but as it is she remains in a state of emotional " limbo " .
the english collective of prostitutes said most working girls did not report attacks by punters because they did not believe they would be treated seriously by police .
a spokeswoman also claimed sometimes officers could be " brutal " in their approach .
" police often have the attitude , ' oh well what do you expect , it 's part of the job is n't it ? ' if a prostitute is raped or attacked . "
she said she believed the police had put huge resources into investigating the five suffolk murders only because the case had gained much media coverage .
" and the police and the council have since got together to crack down on clients and drive the women out of the red-light district , but they are still working in less safe areas , " she added .
' hatred of women ' she said it was not clear why men attacked prostitutes .
some , like peter sutcliffe , claimed they were " cleaning up the streets " , which the spokeswoman said echoed police rhetoric .
peter sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women others were probably just misogynists who found prostitutes to be easy targets , she added .
mrs wilson agrees : " these people are sick .
maybe it 's a hatred of women .
maybe something has happened in their own lives .
working girls are just the easiest targets because many are on heroin and they will carry on even when there is a killer on the loose because they have to feed their habit . "
she said she knew the pain the parents of the ipswich girls had suffered and added : " i am glad this man has been convicted and i pray for their mothers . "

the list goes on and on .
women , often in the grip of drug addiction , who sell their bodies and die at the hands of strangers .
in the past 20 years scores of prostitutes have been murdered in britain and hundreds have been beaten , robbed or raped .
most of these cases remain unsolved .
the victims often have the same sad biographies , marked by drug addiction , which lead them to sell their bodies to fund their habit .
every now and again - the yorkshire ripper , who killed 13 women , most of them prostitutes ; and the ipswich murders - their deaths make the headlines .
but more often than not these killings fail to register with the general public .
in 1996 a nationwide police project , operation enigma , identified 210 unsolved murders of women - many of them prostitutes - which had happened in the previous decade .
two years later they identified 21 " potential clusters " and said they were reopening 70 of the cases .
' human tragedy ' wayne murdock has experienced the frustration of an unsolved murder inquiry .
he was the detective in charge of the investigation into the murder of carol clark , a bristol prostitute whose body was found in sharpness docks , gloucestershire , in march 1993 .
mr murdock , now retired , said : " sometimes members of the public say , ' oh it 's only a prostitute , good riddance , ' but if you started thinking like that , society might as well give up .
she was a human being first and foremost - she was not born to be a prostitute alice wilson " in carol clark 's case i met her parents and they were very decent people and they had no idea what she was doing and it 's just a human tragedy . "
often , if there are no strong leads in the first few weeks , the murder inquiry will be scaled down leaving just a detective , or a small team , who have met the victim 's family and know their grief , to carry on working to obtain justice .
mr murdock said : " it 's not like you see on television .
it 's not easy .
" it takes a heck of a long time , but we have got dna now , which is a huge weapon , and i 'm very confident that some of these cases will be detected and hopefully the carol clark case may be solved in the not too distant future . "
alice wilson 's daughter jacqueline gallagher was killed in glasgow in 1996 and she said the police who investigated her murder were very good .
she told the bbc news website : " they appreciated that she was a human being first and foremost .
she was not born to be a prostitute , but she developed a drug habit .
" but she did not deserve what happened to her .
she had suffered 146 blows to her head and then been strangled . "
lorry driver alun kyte was jailed for life in 2002 for killing two prostitutes the police eventually identified one of jacqueline 's customers as their prime suspect but the case was " not proven " in 2004 .
ms wilson said a conviction would have given her closure , but as it is she remains in a state of emotional " limbo " .
the english collective of prostitutes said most working girls did not report attacks by punters because they did not believe they would be treated seriously by police .
a spokeswoman also claimed sometimes officers could be " brutal " in their approach .
" police often have the attitude , ' oh well what do you expect , it 's part of the job is n't it ? ' if a prostitute is raped or attacked . "
she said she believed the police had put huge resources into investigating the five suffolk murders only because the case had gained much media coverage .
" and the police and the council have since got together to crack down on clients and drive the women out of the red-light district , but they are still working in less safe areas , " she added .
' hatred of women ' she said it was not clear why men attacked prostitutes .
some , like peter sutcliffe , claimed they were " cleaning up the streets " , which the spokeswoman said echoed police rhetoric .
peter sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women others were probably just misogynists who found prostitutes to be easy targets , she added .
mrs wilson agrees : " these people are sick .
maybe it 's a hatred of women .
maybe something has happened in their own lives .
working girls are just the easiest targets because many are on heroin and they will carry on even when there is a killer on the loose because they have to feed their habit . "
she said she knew the pain the parents of the ipswich girls had suffered and added : " i am glad this man has been convicted and i pray for their mothers . "

alice wilson 's daughter jacqueline gallagher was killed in glasgow in 1996 and she said the police who investigated her murder were very good .
she told the bbc news website : " they appreciated that she was a human being first and foremost .
she was not born to be a prostitute , but she developed a drug habit .
" but she did not deserve what happened to her .
she had suffered 146 blows to her head and then been strangled . "
lorry driver alun kyte was jailed for life in 2002 for killing two prostitutes the police eventually identified one of jacqueline 's customers as their prime suspect but the case was " not proven " in 2004 .
ms wilson said a conviction would have given her closure , but as it is she remains in a state of emotional " limbo " .
the english collective of prostitutes said most working girls did not report attacks by punters because they did not believe they would be treated seriously by police .
a spokeswoman also claimed sometimes officers could be " brutal " in their approach .
" police often have the attitude , ' oh well what do you expect , it 's part of the job is n't it ? ' if a prostitute is raped or attacked . "
she said she believed the police had put huge resources into investigating the five suffolk murders only because the case had gained much media coverage .
" and the police and the council have since got together to crack down on clients and drive the women out of the red-light district , but they are still working in less safe areas , " she added .
' hatred of women ' she said it was not clear why men attacked prostitutes .
some , like peter sutcliffe , claimed they were " cleaning up the streets " , which the spokeswoman said echoed police rhetoric .
peter sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women others were probably just misogynists who found prostitutes to be easy targets , she added .
mrs wilson agrees : " these people are sick .
maybe it 's a hatred of women .
maybe something has happened in their own lives .
working girls are just the easiest targets because many are on heroin and they will carry on even when there is a killer on the loose because they have to feed their habit . "
she said she knew the pain the parents of the ipswich girls had suffered and added : " i am glad this man has been convicted and i pray for their mothers . "

he is the latest in a long line of killers who have targeted prostitutes .
could the police be doing more to protect prostitutes and catch their killers ?
prostitute killers 1888 : jack the ripper killed five women in whitechapel , east london .
unsolved 1964-65 : six women killed and dumped in hammersmith and acton , west london .
unsolved 1975-81 : peter sutcliffe , the yorkshire ripper , kills 13 women - most of them prostitutes - and is jailed for life 1993-94 : lorry driver alun kyte kills two women , whose bodies are discovered in leicestershire 1999 : david smith gets life for murdering amanda walker , six years after being acquitted of killing sarah crump 2008 : steve wright convicted of five murders in ipswich marina monti , karen mcgregor , gail whitehouse , lynne trenholme , natalie pearman , julie finlay , vicky glass , tracy wylde , emma caldwell .
the list goes on and on .
women , often in the grip of drug addiction , who sell their bodies and die at the hands of strangers .
in the past 20 years scores of prostitutes have been murdered in britain and hundreds have been beaten , robbed or raped .
most of these cases remain unsolved .
the victims often have the same sad biographies , marked by drug addiction , which lead them to sell their bodies to fund their habit .
every now and again - the yorkshire ripper , who killed 13 women , most of them prostitutes ; and the ipswich murders - their deaths make the headlines .
but more often than not these killings fail to register with the general public .
in 1996 a nationwide police project , operation enigma , identified 210 unsolved murders of women - many of them prostitutes - which had happened in the previous decade .
two years later they identified 21 " potential clusters " and said they were reopening 70 of the cases .
' human tragedy ' wayne murdock has experienced the frustration of an unsolved murder inquiry .
he was the detective in charge of the investigation into the murder of carol clark , a bristol prostitute whose body was found in sharpness docks , gloucestershire , in march 1993 .
mr murdock , now retired , said : " sometimes members of the public say , ' oh it 's only a prostitute , good riddance , ' but if you started thinking like that , society might as well give up . "
she was a human being first and foremost - she was not born to be a prostitute " alice wilson " in carol clark 's case i met her parents and they were very decent people and they had no idea what she was doing and it 's just a human tragedy . "
often , if there are no strong leads in the first few weeks , the murder inquiry will be scaled down leaving just a detective , or a small team , who have met the victim 's family and know their grief , to carry on working to obtain justice .
mr murdock said : " it 's not like you see on television .
it 's not easy .
" it takes a heck of a long time , but we have got dna now , which is a huge weapon , and i 'm very confident that some of these cases will be detected and hopefully the carol clark case may be solved in the not too distant future . "

it will initially be used to monitor car-sharing lanes in leeds , but councils across britain are said to be interested in using the technology .
four out of five cars driving into cities at rush hour have only one person in them .
the government believes encouraging people to share journeys will help combat congestion .
it wants councils to look at building more " high-occupancy vehicle " lanes . "
most of us today work flexible hours .
we do n't go to work or come home from work at the same time " edmund king , aa president enforcing the lanes has previously been a problem .
in the us drivers often trick police and cameras with dummies and even large dogs to allow them to use lanes reserved for more than one person .
the new camera , developed at loughborough university , can see how many people are in a car by detecting water and blood content .
the technology could lead to a big increase in the number of car-share lanes on british roads .
the inventor of the camera , professor john tyrer , believes the camera is key to reducing congestion .
" it allows you to automatically count people .
that means you can sort out the congestion on the roads now the lanes now actually work properly , " he said .
" that pools through to the congestion charging so they can charge differently or reduce the rates dramatically if you 've got more people in the cars , and the same with car parking . "
car-sharing lanes are already in operation in areas of birmingham , leeds , bristol and north somerset .
in birmingham - on the a47 heartlands spine road - only cars carrying at least two people are allowed to join motorbikes and cycles in using the lane , in a bid to ease congestion into the city centre .
work is currently taking place on the m1 in bedfordshire and hertfordshire to widen the road for a car-sharing lane .
environmental benefits roads minister rosie winterton welcomed moves encouraging car sharing .
" we 're certainly encouraging local authorities to look at innovative solutions to the problems that are created by congestion , " she said .
" high-occupancy vehicle lanes can be part of that because they certainly encourage car sharing .
it also contributes to improving the environment and can cut the cost of travelling as well . "
but edmund king , president of the aa , said that in practice , car sharing does not work .
" most of us today work flexible hours .
we do n't go to work or come home from work at the same time , " he said .
" plus they 're incredibly difficult to enforce , and if not many people use them they 're actually a waste of road capacity . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i have given up using the scheme in leeds as it simply does not work .
the time saving over drivers in the ' one person ' lane is often minimal .
government and councils need to be investing their efforts into public transport rather than wasting money on policing us yet more .
i would happily use the buses or trains to get to work if there was an adequate service .
chris , leeds , uk why do n't they market car sharing , convince people to do it rather than trying to force us to .
just a waste of money could be spent on trying to improve our infrastructure for everyone rather than wasting a lane of a road , making the congestion worse for the others .
daniel , isle of man i used to share a car , and was fed up of waiting for fellow car-sharers who did n't seem to have a home to go to , and would keep you waiting like a taxi-driver .
i often waited up to half an hour waiting for them to show .
i was glad to get back to my individual freedom .
peter woodier , manchester , uk will this country stop being obsessed with spying on its citizens once and for all .
camera , camera , camera ! ! !
i 'm fed to the back teeth with councils and government using technology to increase its annual revenue .
maybe we should put cameras in government buildings and see what they really get up to with regards how they are spending our money duncan mcdonald , manchester i am a widow on a pension .
the only way i can get to see my sons is to drive up the motor way .
there is no one else to go with me , so now i am to be penalised for visiting my family on a sunday once a month ?
mrs.e.n.ruffewll , london , england i car share with 2 workmates on a 80 mile round trip which saves me money and driver fatigue as i work shifts plus it is also environmentally friendlier.the awkward bit is the actual meeting place for us where we can leave our cars securely.as i live in sheffield i see the supertram park & ride scheme working extremely well.why on earth cant we provide 24 hour park & share scheme for the motorways where we can all meet and leave our vehicles securely.iam sure more people would car share thus relieving the amount of 1 person car journeys on our major roads not just at peak times but all times.maybe even the motorway services could provide a similar sort of service. mick , sheffield i have both taken part in a car sharing scheme , and therefore been able to use the dedicated lanes where i live .
it works well on many levels .
i save on petrol money , increase my social networks , have someone to natter with on the way to work and back again , get to work quicker , do n't have the stress of having to drive all the time ... i could go on .
it really is a no-brainer .
i would challenge the aa to come up with ideas that do work , instead of constantly complaining about the unworkability of current efforts to solve the problem .
fred ehresmann , bristol , uk this misses the point .
i use my car precisely because at the start and end of a busy day , i do n't want to mix with others who smell of last nights alcohol or garlic or the stinking cigarette they had on the way to the station .
jbpriestly wrote something like " we are not all bees mixed up together " .
our democratic representatives should start looking after the needs of all of their people and find ways to safely enable all activities rather than control their electorate .

four out of five cars driving into cities at rush hour have only one person in them .
the government believes encouraging people to share journeys will help combat congestion .
it wants councils to look at building more " high-occupancy vehicle " lanes .

we do n't go to work or come home from work at the same time edmund king , aa president enforcing the lanes has previously been a problem .
in the us drivers often trick police and cameras with dummies and even large dogs to allow them to use lanes reserved for more than one person .
the new camera , developed at loughborough university , can see how many people are in a car by detecting water and blood content .
the technology could lead to a big increase in the number of car-share lanes on british roads .
the inventor of the camera , professor john tyrer , believes the camera is key to reducing congestion .
" it allows you to automatically count people .
that means you can sort out the congestion on the roads now the lanes now actually work properly , " he said .
" that pools through to the congestion charging so they can charge differently or reduce the rates dramatically if you 've got more people in the cars , and the same with car parking . "
car-sharing lanes are already in operation in areas of birmingham , leeds , bristol and north somerset .
in birmingham - on the a47 heartlands spine road - only cars carrying at least two people are allowed to join motorbikes and cycles in using the lane , in a bid to ease congestion into the city centre .

it will initially be used to monitor car-sharing lanes in leeds , but councils across britain are said to be interested in using the technology .
four out of five cars driving into cities at rush hour have only one person in them .
the government believes encouraging people to share journeys will help combat congestion .
it wants councils to look at building more " high-occupancy vehicle " lanes .
most of us today work flexible hours .
we do n't go to work or come home from work at the same time edmund king , aa president enforcing the lanes has previously been a problem .
in the us drivers often trick police and cameras with dummies and even large dogs to allow them to use lanes reserved for more than one person .
the new camera , developed at loughborough university , can see how many people are in a car by detecting water and blood content .
the technology could lead to a big increase in the number of car-share lanes on british roads .
the inventor of the camera , professor john tyrer , believes the camera is key to reducing congestion .
" it allows you to automatically count people .
that means you can sort out the congestion on the roads now the lanes now actually work properly , " he said .
" that pools through to the congestion charging so they can charge differently or reduce the rates dramatically if you 've got more people in the cars , and the same with car parking . "
car-sharing lanes are already in operation in areas of birmingham , leeds , bristol and north somerset .
in birmingham - on the a47 heartlands spine road - only cars carrying at least two people are allowed to join motorbikes and cycles in using the lane , in a bid to ease congestion into the city centre .
work is currently taking place on the m1 in bedfordshire and hertfordshire to widen the road for a car-sharing lane .
environmental benefits roads minister rosie winterton welcomed moves encouraging car sharing .
" we 're certainly encouraging local authorities to look at innovative solutions to the problems that are created by congestion , " she said .
" high-occupancy vehicle lanes can be part of that because they certainly encourage car sharing .
it also contributes to improving the environment and can cut the cost of travelling as well . "
but edmund king , president of the aa , said that in practice , car sharing does not work .
" most of us today work flexible hours .
we do n't go to work or come home from work at the same time , " he said .
" plus they 're incredibly difficult to enforce , and if not many people use them they 're actually a waste of road capacity . "
read a selection of your comments on this story : i have given up using the scheme in leeds as it simply does not work .
the time saving over drivers in the ' one person ' lane is often minimal .
government and councils need to be investing their efforts into public transport rather than wasting money on policing us yet more .
i would happily use the buses or trains to get to work if there was an adequate service .
chris , leeds , uk why do n't they market car sharing , convince people to do it rather than trying to force us to .
just a waste of money could be spent on trying to improve our infrastructure for everyone rather than wasting a lane of a road , making the congestion worse for the others .
daniel , isle of man i used to share a car , and was fed up of waiting for fellow car-sharers who did n't seem to have a home to go to , and would keep you waiting like a taxi-driver .
i often waited up to half an hour waiting for them to show .
i was glad to get back to my individual freedom .
peter woodier , manchester , uk will this country stop being obsessed with spying on its citizens once and for all .
camera , camera , camera ! ! !
i 'm fed to the back teeth with councils and government using technology to increase its annual revenue .
maybe we should put cameras in government buildings and see what they really get up to with regards how they are spending our money duncan mcdonald , manchester i am a widow on a pension .
the only way i can get to see my sons is to drive up the motor way .
there is no one else to go with me , so now i am to be penalised for visiting my family on a sunday once a month ?
mrs.e.n.ruffewll , london , england i car share with 2 workmates on a 80 mile round trip which saves me money and driver fatigue as i work shifts plus it is also environmentally friendlier.the awkward bit is the actual meeting place for us where we can leave our cars securely.as i live in sheffield i see the supertram park & ride scheme working extremely well.why on earth cant we provide 24 hour park & share scheme for the motorways where we can all meet and leave our vehicles securely.iam sure more people would car share thus relieving the amount of 1 person car journeys on our major roads not just at peak times but all times.maybe even the motorway services could provide a similar sort of service. mick , sheffield i have both taken part in a car sharing scheme , and therefore been able to use the dedicated lanes where i live .
it works well on many levels .
i save on petrol money , increase my social networks , have someone to natter with on the way to work and back again , get to work quicker , do n't have the stress of having to drive all the time ... i could go on .
it really is a no-brainer .
i would challenge the aa to come up with ideas that do work , instead of constantly complaining about the unworkability of current efforts to solve the problem .
fred ehresmann , bristol , uk this misses the point .
i use my car precisely because at the start and end of a busy day , i do n't want to mix with others who smell of last nights alcohol or garlic or the stinking cigarette they had on the way to the station .
