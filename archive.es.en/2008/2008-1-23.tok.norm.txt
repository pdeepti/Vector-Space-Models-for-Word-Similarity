program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu unveils ambitious package to limit global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders seem to have listened to renewable energy activists the european commission on wednesday , jan .
23 , presented sweeping plans to fight global warming , under heavy fire from industry and many eu member countries over the possible costs of the scheme . consumers will not escape the costs either , which commission chief jose manuel barroso said would amount to a total of around 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.6 billion -rrb- a year - 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . " that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu unveils ambitious package to limit global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders seem to have listened to renewable energy activists the european commission on wednesday , jan .
23 , presented sweeping plans to fight global warming , under heavy fire from industry and many eu member countries over the possible costs of the scheme . consumers will not escape the costs either , which commission chief jose manuel barroso said would amount to a total of around 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.6 billion -rrb- a year - 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . " that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .

the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu climate plan rekindles german autobahn speed limit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions are lower at lower speeds germany may have to figure out how to fulfill the eu 's new plan to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .

" russia is a very strong and stable country in europe and they have no reason not to welcome all the observers in moscow and elsewhere in russia , " ilkka kanerva , finland 's foreign minister and the current president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe said on tuesday , jan .
23 , as reported by afp news agency . kanerva had met on monday with russia 's deputy foreign minister alexander grushko about an osce mission for the march 2 election . the vienna-based group withdrew its mission to the december parliamentary elections after moscow delayed invitations to its representatives and cut back the number of authorized observers . " the basic idea of the osce today is to normalize the election monitoring circumstances , not to repeat the circumstances we met in the duma elections in november , " said kanerva . candidate charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasyanov could be kicked out of the race also on tuesday , russia 's chief prosecutor 's office opened a criminal case against opposition leader and presidential candidate mikhail kasyanov for allegedly falsifying nomination signatures . kasyanov , who served as prime minister during president vladimir putin 's first term , needs 2 million signatures to run for president because he does not belong to a party represented in the duma . even if he were to obtain the right to run in the election , his chances are considered slim , as the kremlin has endorsed dmitry medvedev , who is currently first deputy prime minister as well as chairman of the national energy company gazprom . the election commission in moscow told russian press that kasyanov would be eliminated from the running if more than 5 percent of the signatures were spurious . kasyanov has denied the claims . the final list of candidates is expected to be released early next week .
gennadi zyuganov , head of the communist party , and liberal democratic party leader vladimir zhirinovsky , are also registered as candidates , though putin 's pick medvedev is considered to be the clear favorite . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .

by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .

by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .

beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect .

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .

its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .

" that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies .

plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , presented sweeping plans to fight global warming , under heavy fire from industry and many eu member countries over the possible costs of the scheme . consumers will not escape the costs either , which commission chief jose manuel barroso said would amount to a total of around 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.6 billion -rrb- a year - 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . " that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them .

23 , as reported by afp news agency . kanerva had met on monday with russia 's deputy foreign minister alexander grushko about an osce mission for the march 2 election . the vienna-based group withdrew its mission to the december parliamentary elections after moscow delayed invitations to its representatives and cut back the number of authorized observers .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pavarotti was considered one of the greatest tenors of all times .
the italian with sex appeal in his voice could fire out high c ’ s like ammunition .
the baker 's son was born on october 12 , 1935 in modena .

he had his first voice lessons at the age of twenty and his great breakthrough six years later at an international singing competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at home in new york in 2003 in the following years , pavarotti progressed from bel canto to the heroic tenor field , becoming a stage and media superstar .
apart from a supreme showman , he was also a hard worker .
pavarotti ’ s powerful and heavy figure often seemed made for comedy , and from the very beginning he made full use of his physical appearance in selecting his roles .
the world ’ s most beloved tenor wrote a book about his life entitled " i – luciano pavarotti , " recounting his battle with depression in the mid-1970 ‘ s .
that struggle was resolved after a near-encounter with death during a plane accident .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , presented sweeping plans to fight global warming , under heavy fire from industry and many eu member countries over the possible costs of the scheme . consumers will not escape the costs either , which commission chief jose manuel barroso said would amount to a total of around 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.6 billion -rrb- a year - 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . " that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies .

sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them .

" russia is a very strong and stable country in europe and they have no reason not to welcome all the observers in moscow and elsewhere in russia , " ilkka kanerva , finland 's foreign minister and the current president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe said on tuesday , jan .
23 , as reported by afp news agency . kanerva had met on monday with russia 's deputy foreign minister alexander grushko about an osce mission for the march 2 election . the vienna-based group withdrew its mission to the december parliamentary elections after moscow delayed invitations to its representatives and cut back the number of authorized observers . " the basic idea of the osce today is to normalize the election monitoring circumstances , not to repeat the circumstances we met in the duma elections in november , " said kanerva . candidate charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasyanov could be kicked out of the race also on tuesday , russia 's chief prosecutor 's office opened a criminal case against opposition leader and presidential candidate mikhail kasyanov for allegedly falsifying nomination signatures . kasyanov , who served as prime minister during president vladimir putin 's first term , needs 2 million signatures to run for president because he does not belong to a party represented in the duma . even if he were to obtain the right to run in the election , his chances are considered slim , as the kremlin has endorsed dmitry medvedev , who is currently first deputy prime minister as well as chairman of the national energy company gazprom . the election commission in moscow told russian press that kasyanov would be eliminated from the running if more than 5 percent of the signatures were spurious . kasyanov has denied the claims . the final list of candidates is expected to be released early next week .
gennadi zyuganov , head of the communist party , and liberal democratic party leader vladimir zhirinovsky , are also registered as candidates , though putin 's pick medvedev is considered to be the clear favorite . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .

but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .

by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .

the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .

but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .

munich gets ready for a paradox despite complaints from jewish groups that the date is international holocaust remembrance day , a carnival parade through the city of munich is set to go ahead sunday . munich mayor christian ude said there was no legal way to stop the planned parade for fasching , as carnival is known in bavaria . " the memorial day is not a holiday and has no particular legal protections , " ude told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
thus the authorities had no " legal means " of stopping people from celebrating on that day . the annual remembrance date was established by the un general assembly in 2005 and is not a public holiday in germany . central council of jews critiques move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on jan .
27 , 1945 , red army soldiers freed auschwitz captives germany 's central council of jews strongly criticized the decision to plan a carnival parade for that day , and the munich jewish community said that a fun event on jan .
27 showed a total lack of sensitivity . the international auschwitz committee on wednesday called the idea of holding the parade on sunday an " absurd signal . " " the fact that munich , on this day , plans and is going ahead with a carnival celebration shows the thoughtlessness and ignorance of the officials , " the organization said . according to ude , parade organizers learned of the holocaust remembrance date too late to change their plans .
but he said the city would be careful to avoid such date conflicts in the future . the head of the group that planned the parade , peter bosse , said he was " concerned " by the late criticism .
the date had been set since may of 2007 , and no one had voiced opposition to the procession . still , he acknowledged that the date was ill-chosen . remembrance on date auschwitz was freed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing the fool is an important part of celebrating german carnival the memorial day held on jan .
27 is meant to remember the more than 6 million jews and other victims of the nazi regime .
on that date in 1945 , the survivors of the concentration camps at auschwitz-birkenau were freed by the red army . in 1996 , then-german president roman herzog declared the day a national day of remembrance " for the victims of national socialism . "
the un made it official in 2005 . the timing of carnival , which is tied to the date of easter in the catholic church , changes every year . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

air temperatures could rise even more along germany 's baltic coast , according to a study released this week . researchers at the institute for coastal research -lrb- ifk -rrb- in geesthacht , germany , near hamburg , analyzed temperatures readings from the past 100 years for the entire baltic region to draw conclusions for the study . the study showed that average temperatures in basin regions had risen 0.85 degrees c over the past century - that is 0.1 degree c faster than general global air temperatures . northern , southern baltic affected differently bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal waste and fertilizer run-off are causing excessive algae to grow in the baltic calling the study the baltic sea 's equivalent to the un intergovernmental panel on climate change 's report issued in december , hans von storch , the ifk 's director , said average air temperatures on the scandinavian side of the sea were rising even faster than on the german and polish side . " should intensive measures to combat climate change not bring about desired results , it is plausible that air temperatures at the end of this century could increase by 4 to 6 degrees celsius in the northern baltic sea region , " he said .
" on the southern side , which includes large parts of poland and eastern germany , temperatures could increase from 3 to 5 degrees . " while calling the predictions made by the models credible , von storch said they were not guarantees of the future . " the climate scenarios are plausible , but often simplified descriptions of possible futures , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu climate plan rekindles german autobahn speed limit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions are lower at lower speeds germany may have to figure out how to fulfill the eu 's new plan to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu climate plan rekindles german autobahn speed limit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions are lower at lower speeds germany may have to figure out how to fulfill the eu 's new plan to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he graduated from the university of oregon with a degree in both subjects in 1977 , and moved to germany soon afterwards . a music journalist since 1983 , rick now produces three programs at deutsche welle : a world of music , concert hour and hits in germany .
rick has practiced the trade in close collaboration with music program editors and producers in the united states , where his dw festival concerts are regularly broadcast .
rick says , however , that a job like his just does n't exist over there , which is one reason he has made germany his second home . rick is a regular visitor at germany 's major music festivals , particularly the bayreuth festival , and he is addicted to the music of wagner .
but his music interests are inclusive : from bach to be-bop , rameau to rammstein and gregorian chant to grunge .
he likes quoting his idol leonard bernstein : " there are only two kinds of music ; good and bad . " because he is surrounded by so much great music in his office , the radio studio , and in germany 's concert halls , rick finds the sound of silence in his retreat in his eifel mountains in germany 's west all the more satisfying . there , he is currently fixing up an old farm with his partner , maintains a vegetable garden that is much too big , and dotes on his two british longhair cats - noting with satisfaction that they too seem to enjoy the music of wagner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu unveils ambitious package to limit global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders seem to have listened to renewable energy activists the european commission on wednesday , jan .
23 , presented sweeping plans to fight global warming , under heavy fire from industry and many eu member countries over the possible costs of the scheme . consumers will not escape the costs either , which commission chief jose manuel barroso said would amount to a total of around 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.6 billion -rrb- a year - 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . " that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu climate plan rekindles german autobahn speed limit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions are lower at lower speeds germany may have to figure out how to fulfill the eu 's new plan to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german fm : world powers agree on new un resolution on iran the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany agreed on the content of a third un resolution to pressure iran to abandon aspects of its nuclear program at a meeting in berlin tuesday .
-lrb- 22.01.2008 -rrb- germany urges broadening iran sanctions germany wants a show of solidarity for other world leaders when dealing with iran and will push for tougher sanctions at a meeting next week .

he graduated from the university of oregon with a degree in both subjects in 1977 , moved to germany soon afterwards , and made it his home .
a music journalist since 1983 , rick now heads the music department at deutsche welle , his team of music journalists producing content in english , german and russian .
rick is also the host and producer of dw 's concert hour , having practiced the trade in close collaboration with music program editors and producers in the united states , where his dw festival concerts are regularly broadcast .

but his music interests are exhaustive .
as leonard bernstein once said , " there are only two kinds of music : good and bad . "
inundated by so much great music in the office , the studio and germany 's concert halls , rick finds the sound of silence in his eifel mountain retreat in germany 's west all the more satisfying . there , he is currently fixing up an old farm with his partner , maintains a vegetable garden that is much too big , and dotes on his three cats - noting with satisfaction that they too seem to enjoy the music of wagner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - lifestyle europe we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

this is a problem all over the developed world .
the long-term consequences are depleted working forces and less money going into social security schemes .
officials from japan and the european union are trying to come up with solutions . officials in japan and the european union think they can work together to solve their common problems .
kuniko inoguchi , a member of japan ’ s house of representatives and ex-minister for gender equality and social affairs , recently invited a team of european commission officials to kyoto to exchange ideas .
" the total fatality rate has been declining and the population in absolute terms is now beginning to shrink , " inoguchi explained " now , what is the solution to these problems ?
one of the reasons is lack of gender equality .
it ’ s very difficult to both work and have family for many women . "
extremely low birth-rate as minister , kuniko inoguchi introduced a series of measures aimed at improving childcare and encouraging men to become more involved in the upbringing of their children .
with 126 children per 100 couples , japan ’ s birth-rate lies below the eu average which is 148 children per 100 couples .
to prevent japan ’ s birth-rate from dropping even more , every couple would have to have at least two children .
new technologies " the most important thing we can learn is that the eu and japan have the same problems even though the societies are so different , " said vladimir spidla , the eu commissioner for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , in kyoto .
" the japanese are also very technologically advanced , " he added .
" they are doing more than the europeans to use new discoveries and technology to solve the problem . "
to a certain extent , technological discoveries will replace human labour as the population ages and becomes increasingly in need of care .
for example , robots might be used in nursing homes .
respect for the elderly by 2030 , 30 percent of the japanese population will be over 65 years old , by comparison with 25 percent in the eu .
" generally , the japanese have more respect for the elderly than the europeans , " spidla claimed .
" nevertheless , there are some very complicated social problems , for example when people retire , their social status tends to be further associated with their work . "
this is why few japanese retire early .
the average retirement age is 65 and is expected to go up to 70 so that workers can continue paying into pension schemes .
expanding the workforce another way to tackle the problem of japan ’ s ageing and shrinking population would be to make it easier to immigrate to japan .
but the japanese government ’ s official position on immigration is clear - only well-educated people should be allowed to enter the japanese job market .
some ministers are calling for unskilled workers to be allowed into the country too .
others want more women to be more integrated into the workforce .
experts say that if measures are not introduced to expand the workforce , there will not be enough money paid into pension schemes to pay for retired japanese workers .

" the total fatality rate has been declining and the population in absolute terms is now beginning to shrink , " inoguchi explained " now , what is the solution to these problems ?

extremely low birth-rate as minister , kuniko inoguchi introduced a series of measures aimed at improving childcare and encouraging men to become more involved in the upbringing of their children .
with 126 children per 100 couples , japan ’ s birth-rate lies below the eu average which is 148 children per 100 couples .
to prevent japan ’ s birth-rate from dropping even more , every couple would have to have at least two children .

pavarotti was considered one of the greatest tenors of all times .
the italian with sex appeal in his voice could fire out high c ’ s like ammunition .
the baker 's son was born on october 12 , 1935 in modena .
at first , plans were made for him to earn his living as a schoolteacher , and the idea of a singing career was approached with great caution .
he had his first voice lessons at the age of twenty and his great breakthrough six years later at an international singing competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at home in new york in 2003 in the following years , pavarotti progressed from bel canto to the heroic tenor field , becoming a stage and media superstar .
apart from a supreme showman , he was also a hard worker .
pavarotti ’ s powerful and heavy figure often seemed made for comedy , and from the very beginning he made full use of his physical appearance in selecting his roles .
the world ’ s most beloved tenor wrote a book about his life entitled " i – luciano pavarotti , " recounting his battle with depression in the mid-1970 ‘ s .
that struggle was resolved after a near-encounter with death during a plane accident .
later , he joined forces with josé carreras and plácido domingo in the tremendously popular worldwide appearances of " the three tenors . "
he embarked on his farewell tour in 2004 but had to discontinue it last year for health reasons . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .

there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons .

there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .

china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu climate plan rekindles german autobahn speed limit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions are lower at lower speeds germany may have to figure out how to fulfill the eu 's new plan to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .

but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .

pavarotti was considered one of the greatest tenors of all times .
the italian with sex appeal in his voice could fire out high c ’ s like ammunition .
the baker 's son was born on october 12 , 1935 in modena .
at first , plans were made for him to earn his living as a schoolteacher , and the idea of a singing career was approached with great caution .
he had his first voice lessons at the age of twenty and his great breakthrough six years later at an international singing competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at home in new york in 2003 in the following years , pavarotti progressed from bel canto to the heroic tenor field , becoming a stage and media superstar .
apart from a supreme showman , he was also a hard worker .
pavarotti ’ s powerful and heavy figure often seemed made for comedy , and from the very beginning he made full use of his physical appearance in selecting his roles .
the world ’ s most beloved tenor wrote a book about his life entitled " i – luciano pavarotti , " recounting his battle with depression in the mid-1970 ‘ s .
that struggle was resolved after a near-encounter with death during a plane accident .
later , he joined forces with josé carreras and plácido domingo in the tremendously popular worldwide appearances of " the three tenors . "
he embarked on his farewell tour in 2004 but had to discontinue it last year for health reasons . rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 23.01.2008 eu climate plan rekindles german autobahn speed limit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emissions are lower at lower speeds germany may have to figure out how to fulfill the eu 's new plan to cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions .
the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts .

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts .

23 , presented sweeping plans to fight global warming , under heavy fire from industry and many eu member countries over the possible costs of the scheme . consumers will not escape the costs either , which commission chief jose manuel barroso said would amount to a total of around 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 86.6 billion -rrb- a year - 0.5 percent of gross domestic product . " that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

air temperatures could rise even more along germany 's baltic coast , according to a study released this week . researchers at the institute for coastal research -lrb- ifk -rrb- in geesthacht , germany , near hamburg , analyzed temperatures readings from the past 100 years for the entire baltic region to draw conclusions for the study . the study showed that average temperatures in basin regions had risen 0.85 degrees c over the past century - that is 0.1 degree c faster than general global air temperatures . northern , southern baltic affected differently bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal waste and fertilizer run-off are causing excessive algae to grow in the baltic calling the study the baltic sea 's equivalent to the un intergovernmental panel on climate change 's report issued in december , hans von storch , the ifk 's director , said average air temperatures on the scandinavian side of the sea were rising even faster than on the german and polish side . " should intensive measures to combat climate change not bring about desired results , it is plausible that air temperatures at the end of this century could increase by 4 to 6 degrees celsius in the northern baltic sea region , " he said .
" on the southern side , which includes large parts of poland and eastern germany , temperatures could increase from 3 to 5 degrees . " while calling the predictions made by the models credible , von storch said they were not guarantees of the future .

the environment minister said highway speed limits were back on the table but a return to nuclear power was not . german environment minister sigmar gabriel on wednesday , jan .
23 , welcomed the european commission 's energy and climate package to limit global warming , saying that germany was already prepared to meet the targets set out by the eu . but the social democrat added that germany would have to do more if the planned international climate treaty came into effect .
in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .
" germany should not bear the brunt , " he said . the eu commission proposal must still be accepted by the bloc 's member states and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes will be completed by the end of the year . the measures are designed to put into action the aim set by eu leaders last year to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies .

the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .
" we 're prepared for anything . " the site was the location of a train engine and tank factory that employed thousands of forced laborers during world war ii , said city archivist frank-roland klaube . four skeletons were found last week and another 24 on tuesday , jan .
22 .
by wednesday , the number of discoveries had risen to at least 36 . forensic specialists are due to excavate and examine the skeletons at kassel 's university .
the results of their investigations were not expected until next week , at the earliest .
the police said the skeletons were thought to be at least 50 and at most 100 years old .
beyond law and order archivist klaube said the skeletons wore neither watches nor rings , which gave credence to the possibility of them having been forced laborers rather than bombing victims , who would likely have been hastily buried . the site had also been the location of a hospital until 1870 , klaube added .
the dead could thus have been the victims of an epidemic , but only if the estimate that they were no older than 100 years was incorrect . " in any case , one can say that such a big group of people could only be buried in a time in which law and order in germany were out of joint , " he told ap . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

air temperatures could rise even more along germany 's baltic coast , according to a study released this week . researchers at the institute for coastal research -lrb- ifk -rrb- in geesthacht , germany , near hamburg , analyzed temperatures readings from the past 100 years for the entire baltic region to draw conclusions for the study . the study showed that average temperatures in basin regions had risen 0.85 degrees c over the past century - that is 0.1 degree c faster than general global air temperatures . northern , southern baltic affected differently bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal waste and fertilizer run-off are causing excessive algae to grow in the baltic calling the study the baltic sea 's equivalent to the un intergovernmental panel on climate change 's report issued in december , hans von storch , the ifk 's director , said average air temperatures on the scandinavian side of the sea were rising even faster than on the german and polish side .

munich gets ready for a paradox despite complaints from jewish groups that the date is international holocaust remembrance day , a carnival parade through the city of munich is set to go ahead sunday . munich mayor christian ude said there was no legal way to stop the planned parade for fasching , as carnival is known in bavaria . " the memorial day is not a holiday and has no particular legal protections , " ude told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
thus the authorities had no " legal means " of stopping people from celebrating on that day . the annual remembrance date was established by the un general assembly in 2005 and is not a public holiday in germany . central council of jews critiques move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on jan .
27 , 1945 , red army soldiers freed auschwitz captives germany 's central council of jews strongly criticized the decision to plan a carnival parade for that day , and the munich jewish community said that a fun event on jan .
27 showed a total lack of sensitivity . the international auschwitz committee on wednesday called the idea of holding the parade on sunday an " absurd signal . " " the fact that munich , on this day , plans and is going ahead with a carnival celebration shows the thoughtlessness and ignorance of the officials , " the organization said . according to ude , parade organizers learned of the holocaust remembrance date too late to change their plans .
but he said the city would be careful to avoid such date conflicts in the future . the head of the group that planned the parade , peter bosse , said he was " concerned " by the late criticism .
the date had been set since may of 2007 , and no one had voiced opposition to the procession . still , he acknowledged that the date was ill-chosen . remembrance on date auschwitz was freed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing the fool is an important part of celebrating german carnival the memorial day held on jan .
27 is meant to remember the more than 6 million jews and other victims of the nazi regime .
on that date in 1945 , the survivors of the concentration camps at auschwitz-birkenau were freed by the red army . in 1996 , then-german president roman herzog declared the day a national day of remembrance " for the victims of national socialism . "

in that case , the eu aims to cut its emissions by up to 30 percent of 1990 levels .
for germany , that would mean a 42 percent reduction . " a speed limit is becoming ever more important with the tightening of climate targets , " said gabriel .
" every penny counts . " estimates have suggested a speed limit of 130 kilometers -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- per hour on all german highways would only reduce the country 's emissions by around 0.5 percent . a speed limit would become unavoidable after 2009 , gabriel said , setting his sights on a change of government after the next federal elections , and the assumption that the current coalition of christian democrats and social democrats will become history . the christian union parties would not allow a speed limit to be introduced , he said . berlin not quite satisfied but gabriel once more rejected putting an end to germany 's gradual phase-out of nuclear power , which , along with speed limits , is the subject of recurring debate - and disagreement - between the governing parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually phasing out its nuclear plants previously berlin had worked under the assumption that the cuts would be based on the level of emissions in 1990 , the international standard .
but the new plan is based on 2005 levels . thus germany will no longer be able to profit from the fall in emissions that was a result of the collapse of east germany 's industry in the early 1990s .
its plans had revolved around a 36 percent cut in emissions by 2020 , but now will have to make up for a gap of 60-70 million tons . gabriel did say he expected the eu to give germany a break in the dispute over co2 limits for new cars in exchange for it accepting greater emissions cuts than southern european countries that have not done as much to slow down global warming . economics minister michael glos of the christian social union , however , said the load should be equally shared .

the bodies may have been forced laborers in a world war ii factory . the public prosecutor 's office ordered a halt to work on the site after ever more skeletons were discovered in the course of construction work to expand the university of kassel . " it could well be that more skeletons are found , " police spokeswoman sabine knöll told the associated press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 23.01.2008 opinion : more iran sanctions wo n't help , may hurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an agreement by the five permanent un security council members plus germany to strengthen sanctions on iran is n't as positive as it may sound , dw guest commentator bahman niruman says . at a meeting in berlin on tuesday , jan .
22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .
he was a victim of political persecution under the shah 's regime and was forced to leave iran in the 1960s .
he now works as a freelance journalist , writer and academic in berlin . -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies . " industry gets a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power plant operators wo n't like the bill carbon dioxide emissions from industry totaled more than two billion tons in 2005 , around half of the greenhouse gases produced in the eu .
much of the other half comes from transport and agriculture . under the eu 's emissions trading scheme , set to expire in 2012 , eu member states issue carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions permits to industrial users , such as steel mills or power stations , largely for free .
plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , the six nations agreed on the wording of a draft resolution to impose fresh sanctions on iran over its nuclear program . " together , we urgently call on the leadership of iran to meet the demands of the un security council and the international atomic energy agency without constraints , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , jan .
22 , after a two-hour meeting in berlin of foreign ministers from the five-plus-one nations . " i also say : teheran has what it takes to find the way to cooperation and compromise .
there is no confrontation here .
we want a peaceful solution , " steinmeier added . but for all the noise , the foreign minister 's cries are the roar of a toothless lion .
teheran knows perfectly well that the apparently unified position in berlin is actually very shaky . of course , all the countries involved agree that , whatever it takes , iran should be prevented from gaining access to nuclear weapons . " we agree on the understanding that nuclear armaments in iran would have dramatic consequences , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahman nirumand but as is so often the case , the devil is in the details . first of all , the position of the permanent members and germany toward iran was strongly compromised by recent american intelligence reports , which claim tehran already shut down its atomic weapons program in 2003 .
there is a danger it could be started again , but even then , the country would need years to build an atom bomb . in addition , tehran told the iaea it would answer all pending questions by mid-march .
this increasingly diminishes the plausibility of taking strong action against tehran . despite this , the usa , great britain , and now france are calling for stronger sanctions .
and they refuse to rule out the option of a military attack .
germany tends toward seeking a diplomatic response to the conflict . the fact that foreign minister steinmeier made a departure from this basic position in the past weeks and quickly -lrb- perhaps too quickly -rrb- organized the meeting in berlin , could have to do with issues unrelated to the iranian atomic conflict . up to now , russia and china have clearly spoken out in opposition to sanctions .
there is no reason to expect them to change course anytime soon .
both countries have significant economic interests in iran .
russia , iran 's biggest arms provider , is building the country 's first atomic power station , and delivers its atomic fuel .
china is dependent on iranian oil and gas , and is busy conquering the iranian market . according to diplomats involved , in order to reconcile the various positions of the six powers , the participants in berlin agreed on the phrase " moderate intensification " of the current sanctions .
whatever they mean by that , it would be naïve to believe that it would do anything to intimidate the reigning islamists in tehran . just prior to the berlin meeting , tehran government spokesman gholam-hossein elham said the country would stay on the path to its current nuclear goals , and would do so within a " legal and legitimate framework . "
this plan would not be change by a new un resolution , he said . this comment could be seen as an act of defiance , but also as a sign that islamists do not fear sanctions , because sanctions do n't have any serious effects . this same conclusion was reached by the investigative arm of the us congress , the genera accountability organization .
according to a january gao report , tehran has signed contracts valued at $ 20 billion -lrb- 14 billion euros -rrb- to exploit raw-material deposits since 2003 : " iran 's world-wide trade ties and its leading role in energy production make it hard to isolate iran and to exercise pressure . " but even if sanctions would damage iran 's economy and start a crisis there , everyone knows that the country 's rulers are aware that the sanctions would hurt the people , but would not bring the government to its knees . on the contrary , the ruling regime lives from permanent crises .
it uses these to take everyone 's mind off its own incompetency , to strengthen repression of its critics , and to motivate its adherents to fight enemies both real and imagined . seen in this light , even if they can be agreed upon , stronger sanctions will fail to bring about the hoped-for results . bahman nirumand studied german , philosophy and iranian studies in munich , tübingen and berlin .

he graduated from the university of oregon with a degree in both subjects in 1977 , and moved to germany soon afterwards . a music journalist since 1983 , rick now produces three programs at deutsche welle : a world of music , concert hour and hits in germany .
rick has practiced the trade in close collaboration with music program editors and producers in the united states , where his dw festival concerts are regularly broadcast .
rick says , however , that a job like his just does n't exist over there , which is one reason he has made germany his second home . rick is a regular visitor at germany 's major music festivals , particularly the bayreuth festival , and he is addicted to the music of wagner .
but his music interests are inclusive : from bach to be-bop , rameau to rammstein and gregorian chant to grunge .
he likes quoting his idol leonard bernstein : " there are only two kinds of music , good and bad . " because he is surrounded by so much great music in his office , the radio studio , and in germany 's concert halls , rick finds the sound of silence in his retreat in his eifel mountains in germany 's west all the more satisfying . there , he is currently fixing up an old farm with his partner , maintains a vegetable garden that is much to big , and dotes on his two british longhair cats - noting with satisfaction that they too seem to enjoy the music of wagner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

air temperatures could rise even more along germany 's baltic coast , according to a study released this week . researchers at the institute for coastal research -lrb- ifk -rrb- in geesthacht , germany , near hamburg , analyzed temperatures readings from the past 100 years for the entire baltic region to draw conclusions for the study . the study showed that average temperatures in basin regions had risen 0.85 degrees c over the past century - that is 0.1 degree c faster than general global air temperatures . northern , southern baltic affected differently bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animal waste and fertilizer run-off are causing excessive algae to grow in the baltic calling the study the baltic sea 's equivalent to the un intergovernmental panel on climate change 's report issued in december , hans von storch , the ifk 's director , said average air temperatures on the scandinavian side of the sea were rising even faster than on the german and polish side . " should intensive measures to combat climate change not bring about desired results , it is plausible that air temperatures at the end of this century could increase by 4 to 6 degrees celsius in the northern baltic sea region , " he said .
" on the southern side , which includes large parts of poland and eastern germany , temperatures could increase from 3 to 5 degrees . " while calling the predictions made by the models credible , von storch said they were not guarantees of the future . " the climate scenarios are plausible , but often simplified descriptions of possible futures , " he said .

munich gets ready for a paradox despite complaints from jewish groups that the date is international holocaust remembrance day , a carnival parade through the city of munich is set to go ahead sunday . munich mayor christian ude said there was no legal way to stop the planned parade for fasching , as carnival is known in bavaria . " the memorial day is not a holiday and has no particular legal protections , " ude told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
thus the authorities had no " legal means " of stopping people from celebrating on that day . the annual remembrance date was established by the un general assembly in 2005 and is not a public holiday in germany . central council of jews critiques move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on jan .

" " the fact that munich , on this day , plans and is going ahead with a carnival celebration shows the thoughtlessness and ignorance of the officials , " the organization said . according to ude , parade organizers learned of the holocaust remembrance date too late to change their plans .
but he said the city would be careful to avoid such date conflicts in the future . the head of the group that planned the parade , peter bosse , said he was " concerned " by the late criticism .
the date had been set since may of 2007 , and no one had voiced opposition to the procession . still , he acknowledged that the date was ill-chosen . remembrance on date auschwitz was freed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing the fool is an important part of celebrating german carnival the memorial day held on jan .
27 is meant to remember the more than 6 million jews and other victims of the nazi regime .

" russia is a very strong and stable country in europe and they have no reason not to welcome all the observers in moscow and elsewhere in russia , " ilkka kanerva , finland 's foreign minister and the current president of the organization for security and cooperation in europe said on tuesday , jan .
23 , as reported by afp news agency . kanerva had met on monday with russia 's deputy foreign minister alexander grushko about an osce mission for the march 2 election . the vienna-based group withdrew its mission to the december parliamentary elections after moscow delayed invitations to its representatives and cut back the number of authorized observers . " the basic idea of the osce today is to normalize the election monitoring circumstances , not to repeat the circumstances we met in the duma elections in november , " said kanerva . candidate charged with fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kasyanov could be kicked out of the race also on tuesday , russia 's chief prosecutor 's office opened a criminal case against opposition leader and presidential candidate mikhail kasyanov for allegedly falsifying nomination signatures . kasyanov , who served as prime minister during president vladimir putin 's first term , needs 2 million signatures to run for president because he does not belong to a party represented in the duma . even if he were to obtain the right to run in the election , his chances are considered slim , as the kremlin has endorsed dmitry medvedev , who is currently first deputy prime minister as well as chairman of the national energy company gazprom . the election commission in moscow told russian press that kasyanov would be eliminated from the running if more than 5 percent of the signatures were spurious . kasyanov has denied the claims . the final list of candidates is expected to be released early next week .
gennadi zyuganov , head of the communist party , and liberal democratic party leader vladimir zhirinovsky , are also registered as candidates , though putin 's pick medvedev is considered to be the clear favorite . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that amounts to about three euros -lrb- $ 4.35 -rrb- a week for everyone , " barroso said .
the package is an attempt by the eu executive to translate into action the aim of eu leaders , announced last march , to cut emissions of the gases that cause climate change by 20 percent by 2020 , compared to 1990 levels . the measures , including a new look at state aid for environment projects , will set the 27 nations specific targets for renewable energy use , to ensure that 20 percent of the bloc 's energy in 2020 comes from these forms . the commission has come under attack from virtually all sides , including in-house , even before the plans are examined by eu countries and the european parliament , a process brussels hopes to conclude by the end of the year . environment commissioner stavros dimas tried to make the plan more palatable to business , saying that it " gives europe a head start in the race to create a low-carbon global economy that will unleash a wave of innovations and create new jobs in clean technologies .

plants can buy or sell permits if they emit more or less co2 . with the new plan , the european commission would set a single eu-wide number of permits from 2013 .
companies from within the eu would be able to bid for them at auction .
the system would also be extended to other sectors like aviation , petrochemicals , ammonia and aluminum .
sectors not included in the trading scheme would be required by 2020 to cut their emissions by 10 percent based on 2005 levels . but in deference to the powerful industrial lobby , energy-intensive industries would receive free permits , to prevent them from being at a disadvantage compared with non-eu rivals . some companies have complained the requirements to cut emissions cuts could force to move abroad , taking jobs with them . " if we were to relocate our industries outside europe we would then have to transport steel to europe , adding emissions , " said philippe varin , president of the european confederation of iron and steel industries , and chief executive of anglo-dutch steelmaker corus , owned by india 's tata steel . barroso : delay unacceptable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting any longer is not an option for barroso the threat to employment is a powerful argument , but barroso has warned that the energy and climate status quo is unacceptable . " taking action is not cost-free , " he said monday .
the price of inaction " could even approach 20 percent of gdp .
the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the longer we delay , the higher the costs . " the eu plan also foresees the bloc covering one-fifth of all energy demand from renewable sources by 2020 .
those states that are unable to meet mandatory targets would be allowed to pay other eu countries to produce renewable energy on their behalf . currently around 8.5 percent of the bloc 's energy comes from renewable forms , like biomass , wind and solar power , but future load sharing will be based on gdp ; simply put , on a nation 's wealth . this has particularly angered sweden , which already derives around 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources , but could , according to green party calculations be asked to raise that to 52.7 percent . stockholm argues that it is being punished , rather than rewarded , for the eco-friendly efforts it has already made . in germany , 18 percent of energy would have to come from renewable resources , according to the proposal , doubling the current percentage .
germany would also have to reduce its co2 emissions by 14 percent below the 2005 level . german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the plan , saying that the target set for germany was ambitious but reachable . dw staff -lrb- win , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he graduated from the university of oregon with a degree in both subjects in 1977 , and moved to germany soon afterwards . a music journalist since 1983 , rick now produces three programs at deutsche welle : a world of music , concert hour and hits in germany .
rick has practiced the trade in close collaboration with music program editors and producers in the united states , where his dw festival concerts are regularly broadcast .
rick says , however , that a job like his just does n't exist over there , which is one reason he has made germany his second home . rick is a regular visitor at germany 's major music festivals , particularly the bayreuth festival , and he is addicted to the music of wagner .
but his music interests are inclusive : from bach to be-bop , rameau to rammstein and gregorian chant to grunge .
he likes quoting his idol leonard bernstein : " there are only two kinds of music , good and bad . " because he is surrounded by so much great music in his office , the radio studio , and in germany 's concert halls , rick finds the sound of silence in his retreat in his eifel mountains in germany 's west all the more satisfying . there , he is currently fixing up an old farm with his partner , maintains a vegetable garden that is much to big , and dotes on his two british longhair cats - noting with satisfaction that they too seem to enjoy the music of wagner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report criticises the social security agency for its failure to prevent fraud and overpayment .
it also says a system put into place to prevent this was not used properly .
last year , fraud and errors by the ssa led to £ 60m being overpaid , despite the £ 22m being spent over recent years on a programme to prevent overpayment .
however , this was not applied properly and more than 20 % of the cases were never actually examined .
it is estimated that £ 9m was paid out incorrectly because of this .
the audit office found that half of the agency 's staff are not confident that suspected fraud is being investigated properly .
the report also says that the number of suspected frauds continue to rise yet the number of investigations has not kept pace with this .
but where the agency has taken cases to court it has a 97 % success record .

lindsay peppin , 25 , a research student at bangor university , has used human dna techniques to help identify rhino poachers in africa .
" the idea is to link up blood stains , on a poacher 's clothing for example , to a rhino carcass , " she said .
she and other researchers were asked to attend a conference to highlight her work to departments outside their own .
her study will be showcased at a two-day event , beyond boundaries , at the university , which she said was an " exciting opportunity " to share her work .
" i 'm very excited as this is a brilliant opportunity to present my work , something i do n't usually get to practice , " she said .
rhinoceroses are poached for their horns the research student is working on wildlife forensics and genetic fingerprinting , similar to human dna techniques , in conjunction with the university of pretoria in south africa .
she said she chose the subject because the rhino was such a " charismatic " creature .
the conference has been organised as a way of attracting funds for academic research .
" most post-graduate research is funded by funding councils , and people have a right to know where the money is going , we should communicate what we are doing , " she explained .
conference organiser paul butler said the students taking part would have a chance to describe their work to an audience which does not consist of specialists in their field .
" clear communication of often complex ideas to the general public is extremely important to institutions , such as the university , whose continued existence is increasingly dependent upon the funding of academic research , " he added .

major retailers and food producers use a combination of systems from traffic light codes to guideline daily amounts .

it comes as ministers prepare to unveil a range of measures making up their anti-obesity strategy for england .
the cross-government strategy for england will make it clear that a uniform approach is needed to food labelling .
we are a super-tanker heading in the wrong direction and it will take time to turn that around professor mike kelly , of the national institute for health and clinical excellence the food standards agency favours a traffic light system which uses red , amber and green labels to signify whether the food is good for you .
what do the traffic light symbols mean ?
but the watchdog has failed to get the agreement of industry , which has used a mix of different methods .
many favour guideline daily amounts , which are percentages of sugar , salt and fat per serving .
consumer groups have complained that such systems are too complicated .
major retail groups , including tesco and asda , have told the bbc they are not yet prepared to abide by the findings of the independent group examining the issue , despite the government 's call .
consensus needed health secretary alan johnson said : " in this country we are probably ahead of the world in food labelling .
" our retailers and our food manufacturers have looked at this in a very clear way and said ' our consumers do want information ' .
" the problem is there are three systems .
we are saying we want to work with the industry and have an independent review by experts to see which of these three systems is the most effective .
then we hope that we can convince the industry to go for one system . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said the traffic light system was too simplistic .
" if we are going to achieve a consensus in this country which we can then try to drive through on a europe-wide basis , the thing we are going to need is combined traffic light and guideline daily amounts to help people construct their diets . "
mr johnson will unveil government 's obesity strategy in parliament on wednesday afternoon .
he told the bbc that obesity was " probably the biggest public health threat that we face . "
increases in the uk , nearly a quarter of adults and over a tenth of children are obese after sharp increases in the last decade .
the strategy is likely to include measures to encourage cookery lessons in schools and allocate £ 30m to help create a series of healthy towns with comprehensive cycle routes and pedestrian areas .
ministers also want to see councils use their planning powers to prevent fast-food outlets setting up near schools .

last week natasha randall , 17 , was found hanged at her home at blaengarw , near bridgend , and a girl believed to know her self-harmed a day later .
seven young people have committed suicide in the past year in the area .
officers are investigating whether the girls had made contact on the internet , by e-mail or on a networking site .
police also said they had spoken to a number of young people and parents to urge them to be vigilant .
south wales police have joined a focus group , which also includes members from bro morgannwg health trust , local schools and bridgend council , to help prevent suicides and attempted suicides .
supt tim jones , divisional commander of police at bridgend , said they were looking at the circumstance surrounding natasha 's death .
" it is important to stress that at this time we have not established any direct links between -lsb- this -rsb- death and a 15-year-old girl attempting to harm herself in pontycymmer on friday .
he said : ' i 'd never do that to you - i would n't hurt you mam ' .
i think it was a couple of days later that he did it melanie davies , mother of thomas davies , above " however they were known to each other as you would expect in small neighbouring communities , " he said .
" one line of inquiry within the investigation is the examination of the computer of the 17-year-old girl which is currently ongoing .
" clearly communication between friends and associates is an important consideration .
" there is a growing trend for young people to communicate through telephone text messaging and also over the internet whether it 's e-mail or within chat room forums . "
last summer , bridgend coroner philip walters said he was " desperately concerned " about the number of suicides among young men in the bridgend and south wales valleys area .
friends one of those was 20-year-old thomas davies from north cornelly , who hanged himself in february 2007 .
he had been friends with two other young men , david dilling , 19 , and dale crole , 18 , who had been found dead weeks earlier .
thomas 's mother , melanie davies , said she had talked to her son about the deaths of his friends : " he was quite upset about dai -lsb- david dilling -rsb- because he went to school with him .
" i said to him : ' you would never do that to me , would you ? ' .
we need to get the message across that they can contact us about anything they want darren matthews , samaritans " he said : ' i 'd never do that to you - i would n't hurt you mam ' .
i think it was a couple of days later that he did it . "
mrs davies has urged young people to seek help .
" i think they should talk to somebody , even if it 's a stranger .
they really need to speak to somebody , even if it 's over the phone . "
darren matthews , branch director of the samaritans charity in bridgend , said there had been a " marked increase " in the suicide rate among young people over the past year , adding they had heard reports of at least one suicide a month .
' chat ' his organisation has been involved for over a year with a suicide prevention group , and has also been holding meetings with the local mp madeleine moon on the issue since june .
" the problem is young people think their problems are too trivial .
we need to get the message across that they can contact us about anything they want .
" madeleine was instrumental in setting up what we call coffee-and-a-chat sessions to get young people to come along and chat , whether about moving from home to university , families , whatever , " mr matthews said .
asked whether he thought modern technology could be adding to the problem , he said : " the internet is a method of communication that has been used for some time and just like the telephone you ca n't stop people using it .
" we ca n't say whether it has any impact on suicides .
" we do a lot of work with social networking sites and we are on these websites and hopefully people will come through to us . "

fibre firm h2o provides super-fast broadband via the sewers and either bournemouth , northampton or dundee will be offered the service first .
it will compete with more established companies , such as virgin media , which is speeding up its cable network .
it follows government concerns that the uk is not embracing next-gen broadband .
transforming services ?
while other countries ' plans for next generation broadband - offering speeds of up to 100mbps - are well advanced , the uk has slipped down the speed league tables .
for consumers , super-fast net connections could create a range of new applications including on-demand high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- tv , dvd quality film downloads in minutes , online video messaging , cctv home surveillance and hd gaming services .
last month bt announced that its own fibre to the home trial at ebbsfleet in kent would see the first homes connected by august of this year .
but this will initially be limited to around 600 new houses .
the development will eventually have some 10,000 homes connected via fibre with speeds of up to 100mbps but the project will take until 2020 to complete .
we are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband elfed thomas , h20 future broadband technologies while bt has pledged to provide all new housing estates in the uk with fibre connections it has not yet made clear its plans for existing homes .
the current telecommunications system was never designed to carry data and many have called for an urgent fibre upgrade .
bt has argued that with costs of up to £ 15bn to roll out such a network it needs to be convinced of demand and have assurances from the government that it will be able to recoup its investment .
at the end of last year , virgin media announced that it would be upgrading its entire cable network - which covers half of uk homes - to provide speeds of up to 50mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- and this is expected to begin towards the end of this year and be completed in 2009 .
london-based firm geo , which also offers fibre via the sewers , serves mainly businesses but also leases its fibre to consumer providers such as tiscali and carphone warehouse .
broadband caution antony walker , head of the uk 's broadband stakeholder 's group , cautioned that the h20 scheme could not create a fibred britain alone .
" there are clearly benefits to using the sewers and this fibre deployment is good news but it is only a small piece of the jigsaw , " he said .
the burgeoning fibre market is going to be a tough one for providers , according to ian fogg , an analyst with jupiterresearch .
" an optimistic view is that they will need penetration rates of between 15 and 20 % of households in a particular area and with so many providers offering services that makes the business case very challenging , " he said .
mr thomas of h2o is confident that its mega-fast service will have instant appeal for consumers and is pleased to be the first to offer such high speeds .
" we are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband , " he said .
the service will be delivered to individual homes via a four-inch box attached to the house .
it will also serve local businesses and council services .
bournemouth , northampton and dundee have been selected because h20 has already installed its fibre service to local council buildings .
the fact that the sewer-based fibre takes advantage of existing ducting means there is no need for expensive and disruptive road digging , making the system faster and cheaper to deliver .
" while deploying traditional fibre over a two-kilometre area would be six to 12 months in the planning .
we can do it in four hours , " said mr thomas .
mr thomas said the sewers solution was a lot cheaper than the conventional route of digging up roads .
" an average town of 75,000 homes would cost someone deploying traditional fibre between £ 50m and £ 70m .
we can do it for 20 to 30 % of that , " said mr thomas .
h20 said it is in " advanced talks " with media partners and internet service providers who will offer the service to consumers .
the first of these partners is due to be announced next month .
roll-out in the chosen town will begin in september and take 18 months to complete .
mr thomas hopes to add another 14 towns over the next five years .

transforming services ?
while other countries ' plans for next generation broadband - offering speeds of up to 100mbps - are well advanced , the uk has slipped down the speed league tables .
for consumers , super-fast net connections could create a range of new applications including on-demand high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- tv , dvd quality film downloads in minutes , online video messaging , cctv home surveillance and hd gaming services .
last month bt announced that its own fibre to the home trial at ebbsfleet in kent would see the first homes connected by august of this year .
but this will initially be limited to around 600 new houses .
the development will eventually have some 10,000 homes connected via fibre with speeds of up to 100mbps but the project will take until 2020 to complete .
we are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband elfed thomas , h20 future broadband technologies while bt has pledged to provide all new housing estates in the uk with fibre connections it has not yet made clear its plans for existing homes .
the current telecommunications system was never designed to carry data and many have called for an urgent fibre upgrade .
bt has argued that with costs of up to £ 15bn to roll out such a network it needs to be convinced of demand and have assurances from the government that it will be able to recoup its investment .
at the end of last year , virgin media announced that it would be upgrading its entire cable network - which covers half of uk homes - to provide speeds of up to 50mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- and this is expected to begin towards the end of this year and be completed in 2009 .
london-based firm geo , which also offers fibre via the sewers , serves mainly businesses but also leases its fibre to consumer providers such as tiscali and carphone warehouse .
broadband caution antony walker , head of the uk 's broadband stakeholder 's group , cautioned that the h20 scheme could not create a fibred britain alone .
" there are clearly benefits to using the sewers and this fibre deployment is good news but it is only a small piece of the jigsaw , " he said .
the burgeoning fibre market is going to be a tough one for providers , according to ian fogg , an analyst with jupiterresearch .
" an optimistic view is that they will need penetration rates of between 15 and 20 % of households in a particular area and with so many providers offering services that makes the business case very challenging , " he said .
mr thomas of h2o is confident that its mega-fast service will have instant appeal for consumers and is pleased to be the first to offer such high speeds .
" we are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband , " he said .
the service will be delivered to individual homes via a four-inch box attached to the house .
it will also serve local businesses and council services .
bournemouth , northampton and dundee have been selected because h20 has already installed its fibre service to local council buildings .
the fact that the sewer-based fibre takes advantage of existing ducting means there is no need for expensive and disruptive road digging , making the system faster and cheaper to deliver .
" while deploying traditional fibre over a two-kilometre area would be six to 12 months in the planning .
we can do it in four hours , " said mr thomas .
mr thomas said the sewers solution was a lot cheaper than the conventional route of digging up roads .
" an average town of 75,000 homes would cost someone deploying traditional fibre between £ 50m and £ 70m .
we can do it for 20 to 30 % of that , " said mr thomas .
h20 said it is in " advanced talks " with media partners and internet service providers who will offer the service to consumers .
the first of these partners is due to be announced next month .
roll-out in the chosen town will begin in september and take 18 months to complete .
mr thomas hopes to add another 14 towns over the next five years .

transforming services ?
while other countries ' plans for next generation broadband - offering speeds of up to 100mbps - are well advanced , the uk has slipped down the speed league tables .
for consumers , super-fast net connections could create a range of new applications including on-demand high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- tv , dvd quality film downloads in minutes , online video messaging , cctv home surveillance and hd gaming services .
last month bt announced that its own fibre to the home trial at ebbsfleet in kent would see the first homes connected by august of this year .
but this will initially be limited to around 600 new houses .
the development will eventually have some 10,000 homes connected via fibre with speeds of up to 100mbps but the project will take until 2020 to complete .
we are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband elfed thomas , h20 future broadband technologies while bt has pledged to provide all new housing estates in the uk with fibre connections it has not yet made clear its plans for existing homes .
the current telecommunications system was never designed to carry data and many have called for an urgent fibre upgrade .
bt has argued that with costs of up to £ 15bn to roll out such a network it needs to be convinced of demand and have assurances from the government that it will be able to recoup its investment .
at the end of last year , virgin media announced that it would be upgrading its entire cable network - which covers half of uk homes - to provide speeds of up to 50mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- and this is expected to begin towards the end of this year and be completed in 2009 .
london-based firm geo , which also offers fibre via the sewers , serves mainly businesses but also leases its fibre to consumer providers such as tiscali and carphone warehouse .
broadband caution antony walker , head of the uk 's broadband stakeholder 's group , cautioned that the h20 scheme could not create a fibred britain alone .
" there are clearly benefits to using the sewers and this fibre deployment is good news but it is only a small piece of the jigsaw , " he said .
the burgeoning fibre market is going to be a tough one for providers , according to ian fogg , an analyst with jupiterresearch .
" an optimistic view is that they will need penetration rates of between 15 and 20 % of households in a particular area and with so many providers offering services that makes the business case very challenging , " he said .
mr thomas of h2o is confident that its mega-fast service will have instant appeal for consumers and is pleased to be the first to offer such high speeds .
" we are talking here about fibre speed ; not that dreaded word broadband , " he said .
the service will be delivered to individual homes via a four-inch box attached to the house .
it will also serve local businesses and council services .
bournemouth , northampton and dundee have been selected because h20 has already installed its fibre service to local council buildings .
the fact that the sewer-based fibre takes advantage of existing ducting means there is no need for expensive and disruptive road digging , making the system faster and cheaper to deliver .
" while deploying traditional fibre over a two-kilometre area would be six to 12 months in the planning .
we can do it in four hours , " said mr thomas .
mr thomas said the sewers solution was a lot cheaper than the conventional route of digging up roads .
" an average town of 75,000 homes would cost someone deploying traditional fibre between £ 50m and £ 70m .
we can do it for 20 to 30 % of that , " said mr thomas .
h20 said it is in " advanced talks " with media partners and internet service providers who will offer the service to consumers .
the first of these partners is due to be announced next month .
roll-out in the chosen town will begin in september and take 18 months to complete .
mr thomas hopes to add another 14 towns over the next five years .

he said ministers did scotland a " great service " in calling in his application for an aberdeenshire golf resort after it was rejected by a council committee .
mr trump told bbc scotland that he was " honoured " by the parliamentary inquiry into the affair , as it may lead to improvements in the planning process .
meanwhile , mr salmond appeared again at the holyrood probe into the £ 1bn plans .
the inquiry has been investigating the handling of the proposals , which were called in by ministers after being rejected by aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure committee .
speaking exclusively to bbc scotland , mr trump referred to that decision as " a little road block " .
he said : " i hardly know alex salmond , but what i know is that he 's an amazing man . "
maybe he -lrb- alex salmond -rrb- wo n't want this project ... although it would be hard to believe when 93 % of the local community voted for it in the local paper " donald trump send us your views fighting spirit from trump questioning trump 's claims " he 's a person who believes strongly in scotland and he wants economic development in scotland .
" alex salmond and i have virtually never even talked about this job but i know for a fact that he - and anyone else who 's representing scotland , unless they 're the enemy - wants billions of pounds to come into aberdeenshire and scotland . "
he said he had " great respect " for mr salmond and that they only talked about scotland when they met last year .
" maybe he wo n't want this project - it 's possible - although it would be hard to believe when 93 % of the local community voted for it in the local paper , " he added .
but mr trump said he had been given no assurances by the first minister about the proposed golf development .
meanwhile , mr salmond was questioned for a second time by holyrood 's local government committee , which is looking into the handling of the trump plans .
concern over inquiry impact he stated that he had never spoken publicly or privately about the merits of the application as first minister .
mr salmond added that he had expressed support for the golf course plans - with some reservations - at a hustings during the holyrood election campaign , before he was an msp or a minister .
the committee also again question finance secretary john swinney .
he will decide if the plans for the menie estate get the go-ahead .
scottish liberal democrat leader nicol stephen has been the most vocal critic over the government 's involvement with the plans , claiming its handling of them " smelled of sleaze " .
mr salmond is excluded from the decision-making process because mr trump 's plans are in his gordon seat , but said he had done nothing wrong in meeting with all sides on the issue in his role as a constituency msp .
scotland 's top civil servant , sir john elvidge , has also ruled that all civil servants involved in the planning application had obeyed the rules .

when the gloucester-based company went bust with the loss of more than 200 jobs in december , about 45,000 customers were affected .
the firm blamed litigation over a cancelled cruise as the reason for going into administration .
bristol-based phoenix holidays , set up by former travelscope managers , has bought the company but 12,000 holidays have been cancelled .
no flights paul clark , from the administrators menzies corporate restructuring -lrb- mcr -rrb- , said : " it has unfortunately been necessary to cancel approximately 12,000 passenger holidays , covering all holidays with departure dates between 22 december 2007 and 31 january 2008 .
" however i hope that phoenix holidays can now assist the remaining passengers with either fulfilling their holidays or offering them an alternative holiday of similar standard . "
phoenix holidays has been set up by darren parris and anu desai , former managers with the failed travelscope .
" this announcement means that a large number of travelscope passengers who have booked a coach holiday or a river cruise can have their holidays fulfilled , and these passengers can look forward to their holiday with renewed peace of mind , " said mr parris .
" in the immediate term , however , phoenix will not be offering any holidays by air and therefore passengers who have booked flight holidays with travelscope will need to complete a claim form with the civil aviation authority . "

in an interview with bbc news , mr soros said he supported the us federal reserve 's surprise interest rate cut , which bolstered global stock indexes .
" you do have to rescue markets otherwise you would go into a depression , as you did in the 1930s . "
he also said that the current market turmoil is a sign of global influence shifting to the developing world .
' shift of power ' " i 'm not looking for a worldwide recession , " he said .
" i 'm looking for a significant shift of power and influence away from the us in particular and a shift in favour of the developing world , particularly china . "
he added that authorities have trusted markets too much over the past 20 years .
" the authorities came to rely on the markets to right themselves , " he said .
" but they ought to have known better because they have in the past come to the rescue . "
mr soros was the man reported to have made $ 1bn profit in september 1992 , betting correctly that the british currency would have to be devalued and leave the european exchange rate mechanism .

instead the uk wants to divert the proceeds of the levy - which could stretch to £ 1bn a year - into general treasury funds .
it will mean that all uk energy users , including households , will pay part of their energy bills to the treasury .
the move is part of a huge eu energy announcement and may prove contentious .
but it is obscure and complicated .
a government source told bbc news that ministers hope the decision will avoid controversy .
this is how it will happen : at the moment big polluters in the uk have their carbon emissions capped as part of the european emissions trading system , the euets .
trading system abuse firms are given a fixed number of carbon emissions allowances - and if they can not keep pollution within those limits , they need to buy extra allowances .
the idea is to tackle climate change by making it more expensive to pollute .
last year there was anger when bbc news revealed that energy generators in the uk were abusing the trading system .
they persuaded the energy regulator ofgem that they needed to put up the price of energy to reflect the market price of carbon allowances .
but because they had been given most of their allowances free of charge they pocketed huge windfall profits , according to a government report .
the eu announcement will insist that power firms should buy some or their allowances .
the figures will be revealed at lunchtime .
treasury refusal the allowances will be sold at auctions run by national governments .
this will mean that part of the profits from the allowances will pass to member states .
the european commission wants governments to ring-fence this new cash to create dedicated funds to transform europe into a low-carbon economy .
but the uk treasury has refused .
the funds from auctioning , a government spokesman confirmed , will go into general treasury coffers .
a government source said they realised there was a risk this could be seen as a stealth tax and could undermine credibility of the eu 's environment policies .
but he said the treasury had an objection in principle to ear-marking any taxes .

instead the uk wants to divert the proceeds of the levy - which could stretch to £ 1bn a year - into general treasury funds .
it will mean that all uk energy users , including households , will pay part of their energy bills to the treasury .
the move is part of a huge eu energy announcement and may prove contentious .
but it is obscure and complicated .
a government source told bbc news that ministers hope the decision will avoid controversy .
this is how it will happen : at the moment big polluters in the uk have their carbon emissions capped as part of the european emissions trading system , the euets .
trading system abuse firms are given a fixed number of carbon emissions allowances - and if they can not keep pollution within those limits , they need to buy extra allowances .
the idea is to tackle climate change by making it more expensive to pollute .
last year there was anger when bbc news revealed that energy generators in the uk were abusing the trading system .
they persuaded the energy regulator ofgem that they needed to put up the price of energy to reflect the market price of carbon allowances .
but because they had been given most of their allowances free of charge they pocketed huge windfall profits , according to a government report .
the eu announcement will insist that power firms should buy some or their allowances .
the figures will be revealed at lunchtime .
treasury refusal the allowances will be sold at auctions run by national governments .
this will mean that part of the profits from the allowances will pass to member states .
the european commission wants governments to ring-fence this new cash to create dedicated funds to transform europe into a low-carbon economy .
but the uk treasury has refused .
the funds from auctioning , a government spokesman confirmed , will go into general treasury coffers .
a government source said they realised there was a risk this could be seen as a stealth tax and could undermine credibility of the eu 's environment policies .
but he said the treasury had an objection in principle to ear-marking any taxes .

mr trump says people fight him because of who he is interview in full donald trump is excited .
he 's in his office on the 26th floor of trump tower on new york 's fifth avenue and the phones are ringing .
share prices are plummeting .
this , he says with relish , is a challenge .
and say what you like about trump , the man loves a fight .
all this and it 's his third wedding anniversary to third wife melania .
so with more than enough going on in trumpworld is he still happy to discuss golf ?
sure , he 's always happy to discuss golf .
i 'm in new york to meet the donald and see what he 's provided for golfers here .
at westchester in the village of briarcliff manor , less than an hour 's drive away upstate , members include jack nicholson , clint eastwood and former president bill clinton .
their names are on their lockers .
membership , which costs $ 350,000 , is not cheap .
even with the healthy exchange rate , that 's a big-time commitment to a good walk spoiled .
the 13th hole here is the most expensive in the united states .
it boasts two waterfalls and cost $ 7m .
' beautiful and elegant ' the course is closed over the winter , but on the coldest day so far they switch the waterfalls on - using 5,000 gallons a minute .
trump is keen to impress .
he 's very happy to discuss his plans for the menie estate on the aberdeenshire coast .
it will , he says , be one of the most beautiful jobs of its kind anywhere in the world .
it will top everything else and wo n't be done in an " atrocious " way .
it will be done in a " beautiful and elegant way " .
but others are not so sure - especially environmentalists and some local residents .
trump wants to build two courses , a 450-bedroom hotel , 950 holiday homes and 500 residential units .
half of the championship course will be on a site of special scientific interest .
jack nicholson is a member of one of mr trump 's exclusive clubs trump reveals that he originally wanted at least twice as much housing on the 1,500 acre site , but decided against it .
but he insists the environmental work required means he does need the housing to pay for it - otherwise , he says , he 'd " lose his shirt " .
on public access , he says he will obey the laws of scotland .
will it be a closed , gated community ?
not decided yet .
that will depend on the market .
but despite all the bluster , all the hyperbole , trump still seems genuinely hurt at the rejection of his plans by aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure committee .
he ca n't understand why a project which he claims is so popular came to be thrown out by what he calls " a little roadblock " .

mr trump says people fight him because of who he is interview in full donald trump is excited .
he 's in his office on the 26th floor of trump tower on new york 's fifth avenue and the phones are ringing .
share prices are plummeting .
this , he says with relish , is a challenge .
and say what you like about trump , the man loves a fight .
all this and it 's his third wedding anniversary to third wife melania .
so with more than enough going on in trumpworld is he still happy to discuss golf ?
sure , he 's always happy to discuss golf .
i 'm in new york to meet the donald and see what he 's provided for golfers here .
at westchester in the village of briarcliff manor , less than an hour 's drive away upstate , members include jack nicholson , clint eastwood and former president bill clinton .
their names are on their lockers .
membership , which costs $ 350,000 , is not cheap .
even with the healthy exchange rate , that 's a big-time commitment to a good walk spoiled .
the 13th hole here is the most expensive in the united states .
it boasts two waterfalls and cost $ 7m .
' beautiful and elegant ' the course is closed over the winter , but on the coldest day so far they switch the waterfalls on - using 5,000 gallons a minute .
trump is keen to impress .
he 's very happy to discuss his plans for the menie estate on the aberdeenshire coast .
it will , he says , be one of the most beautiful jobs of its kind anywhere in the world .
it will top everything else and wo n't be done in an " atrocious " way .
it will be done in a " beautiful and elegant way " .
but others are not so sure - especially environmentalists and some local residents .
trump wants to build two courses , a 450-bedroom hotel , 950 holiday homes and 500 residential units .
half of the championship course will be on a site of special scientific interest .
jack nicholson is a member of one of mr trump 's exclusive clubs trump reveals that he originally wanted at least twice as much housing on the 1,500 acre site , but decided against it .
but he insists the environmental work required means he does need the housing to pay for it - otherwise , he says , he 'd " lose his shirt " .
on public access , he says he will obey the laws of scotland .
will it be a closed , gated community ?
not decided yet .
that will depend on the market .
but despite all the bluster , all the hyperbole , trump still seems genuinely hurt at the rejection of his plans by aberdeenshire council 's infrastructure committee .
he ca n't understand why a project which he claims is so popular came to be thrown out by what he calls " a little roadblock " .
he claims he 's the real environmentalist .
and he denies he 's only in it to line his own pockets , arguing that the jobs will be skilled and all that will work its way back into the local economy .
he admires the first minister , calling alex salmond " an amazing man " .
