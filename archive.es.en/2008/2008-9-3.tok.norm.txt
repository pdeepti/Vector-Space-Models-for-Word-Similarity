program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 03.09.2008 cambodia 's fishing industry is ailing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen on the mekong river cambodia is home to some of the world ’ s most intensive freshwater fisheries .
the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9800 asian development bank the adb is planning to rope in the private sector to cater to primary development needs by 2020 .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9800 environment an indian ngo is distributing solar lanterns to villagers in the state of maharashtra .

after that , if parliament does not create a new coalition within 30 days , yushchenko can call an election . if the parliament is dissolved , ukraine could be facing its third parliamentary election since the 2004 orange revolution that swept yushchenko to power on the promise of strengthening ties with the european union and the united states that includes ultimately joining the eu club and nato . the former orange revolution allies are now bitter rivals , likely to square off in the 2010 presidential election . deal with moscow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko accused his former ally of making a pact not to fault russia for the georgia war yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of not backing tbilisi when russians troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia in the caucasus conflict . political observers have expressed concern that kremlin might try to capitalize on the political instability in ukraine , which is strategically critical to the west for the pipelines that carry russian gas to european consumers . however the deepening political crisis seemed to have at least as much impact on the money markets with investors nervous about the geopolitical risk of doing business in the former soviet bloc following last month ’ s military conflict in caucasus region .

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 03.09.2008 opinion : afghanistan needs politics , not more troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the increasing number of attacks on german soldiers in afghanistan , prematurely withdrawing troops would leave behind a dangerous power vacuum , said dw 's martin gerner . now it 's a matter of damage control .
the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .
however karadzic 's close aide and wartime general ratko mladic still remains at large . candidacy linked to mladic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic arrest : " milestone " for serbia 's eu aspirations the eu said it would wait for war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz to report on whether serbia was fully cooperating with the un tribunal , before taking any concrete steps towards belgrade 's aspirations for eu membership . " i encourage this new government of serbia to continue its efforts in order to clear the hurdles from the european union road completely , " barroso said .
" it is important to ensure full cooperation with international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- he added that karadzic 's arrest was an " historic moment and a milestone for serbia 's european aspirations . " since being sworn in for a second presidential term in february , tadic , a pro-western leader who is a strong proponent of serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , has been rapidly moving his country in the path towards eu integration .
the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .
" we are going to continue our cooperation with the hague tribunal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu nations recognise kosovo , but not belgrade tadic said his administration was " doing everything possible to find mladic , and i promise that we 're going to continue our cooperation with the tribunal . " the afp news agency , however , cited a bosnian daily newspaper report last month in which mladic was already in talks with serbia 's secret services about his surrender . eu and serbia divide over kosovo tadic also stressed his country 's need to ratify the stabilization and association agreement , which was signed with the eu in belgrade last april .
the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .
most eu nations and the united states have recognized the predominantly ethnic albanian enclave that unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february after nearly a decade under un administration . belgrade sees the region as an integral part of serbia . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .
however karadzic 's close aide and wartime general ratko mladic still remains at large . candidacy linked to mladic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic arrest : " milestone " for serbia 's eu aspirations the eu said it would wait for war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz to report on whether serbia was fully cooperating with the un tribunal , before taking any concrete steps towards belgrade 's aspirations for eu membership . " i encourage this new government of serbia to continue its efforts in order to clear the hurdles from the european union road completely , " barroso said .
" it is important to ensure full cooperation with international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- he added that karadzic 's arrest was an " historic moment and a milestone for serbia 's european aspirations . " since being sworn in for a second presidential term in february , tadic , a pro-western leader who is a strong proponent of serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , has been rapidly moving his country in the path towards eu integration .
the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .
" we are going to continue our cooperation with the hague tribunal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu nations recognise kosovo , but not belgrade tadic said his administration was " doing everything possible to find mladic , and i promise that we 're going to continue our cooperation with the tribunal . " the afp news agency , however , cited a bosnian daily newspaper report last month in which mladic was already in talks with serbia 's secret services about his surrender . eu and serbia divide over kosovo tadic also stressed his country 's need to ratify the stabilization and association agreement , which was signed with the eu in belgrade last april .
the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .
most eu nations and the united states have recognized the predominantly ethnic albanian enclave that unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february after nearly a decade under un administration . belgrade sees the region as an integral part of serbia . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will use my right to dismiss parliament and announce early elections , " yushchenko said in a televised statement on wednesday , sept .

" you have 10 days of no ultimatums , no demands , no provocations , to come back to the democratic coalition , " she said in a televised statement . under the constitution , the coalition has 10 days to work out its differences .
after that , if parliament does not create a new coalition within 30 days , yushchenko can call an election . if the parliament is dissolved , ukraine could be facing its third parliamentary election since the 2004 orange revolution that swept yushchenko to power on the promise of strengthening ties with the european union and the united states that includes ultimately joining the eu club and nato . the former orange revolution allies are now bitter rivals , likely to square off in the 2010 presidential election . deal with moscow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko accused his former ally of making a pact not to fault russia for the georgia war yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of not backing tbilisi when russians troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia in the caucasus conflict . political observers have expressed concern that kremlin might try to capitalize on the political instability in ukraine , which is strategically critical to the west for the pipelines that carry russian gas to european consumers . however the deepening political crisis seemed to have at least as much impact on the money markets with investors nervous about the geopolitical risk of doing business in the former soviet bloc following last month ’ s military conflict in caucasus region .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .

the internal security agency searched the company 's headquarters , spokeswoman for the polish prosecutor , malgorzata klaus , told the pap news agency .
the firm 's headquarters was searched by the internal security agency . among the items found in the raid were nazi replicas including swastikas , military insignia and rings with skulls like those worn by nazi germany 's ss troops .
according to the polska newspaper , the items were produced for a german citizen from the former east germany .
the distribution or wearing of nazi-era symbols is banned in germany . " it is legal to produce such items for the needs of film producers or collectors , " klaus said . poland is europe 's biggest producer and exporter of nazi memorabilia .
most of the items are sold to neo-nazis in germany or scandinavia , polska said .
buying nazi symbols is illegal in those countries , but allowed in poland .
ss emblems and swastika armbands can be purchased at markets in poland 's larger cities . business is also booming on the internet , with one polish auction web site offering some 600 items .
a complete ss officer 's uniform goes for 3,000 zloty -lrb- $ 1,400 or 890 euros -rrb- , while iron crosses cost 15 zloty and are often sold in bulk , polska said . polish law forbids promoting nazi ideology , said klaus , but not selling historic mementos or reproductions .

yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the internal security agency searched the company 's headquarters , spokeswoman for the polish prosecutor , malgorzata klaus , told the pap news agency .
the firm 's headquarters was searched by the internal security agency . among the items found in the raid were nazi replicas including swastikas , military insignia and rings with skulls like those worn by nazi germany 's ss troops .
according to the polska newspaper , the items were produced for a german citizen from the former east germany .
the distribution or wearing of nazi-era symbols is banned in germany . " it is legal to produce such items for the needs of film producers or collectors , " klaus said . poland is europe 's biggest producer and exporter of nazi memorabilia .
most of the items are sold to neo-nazis in germany or scandinavia , polska said .
buying nazi symbols is illegal in those countries , but allowed in poland .
ss emblems and swastika armbands can be purchased at markets in poland 's larger cities . business is also booming on the internet , with one polish auction web site offering some 600 items .
a complete ss officer 's uniform goes for 3,000 zloty -lrb- $ 1,400 or 890 euros -rrb- , while iron crosses cost 15 zloty and are often sold in bulk , polska said . polish law forbids promoting nazi ideology , said klaus , but not selling historic mementos or reproductions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance .

some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .

this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .

according to a company spokesman , some 360 million euros -lrb- $ 518 million -rrb- will be invested in the augsburg and nordenham plants . a new 180 million-euro plant will be built in the southern german city of augsburg .
according to the augsburg plant manager hans lonsinger , it will be the most modern of its type , producing fuselages for airbus a350 long-distance aircraft .
another 180 million euros will be invested in nordenham , on the north sea . originally eads wanted to get rid of the plants in order to minimize the a350 development risks .
the planned sale fell through at the end of march , however , due to the falling dollar and the turbulence in the international financial market .
despite the failed sale , eads still wants to form a new subsidiary called premium aerotec that will group together the two plants in augsburg , along with the plants in nordenham and varel , said the spokesman . " we ca n't just lay our hands in our laps and wait and see what happens , " he said . premium aerotec , which will be headquartered in augsburg , will have around 6,000 employees .
it is expected to have a yearly earning potential of 1.3 billion euros .
the company will be taken over by hans losinger , whose first task will be overseeing the construction of the 63,000 square-meter -lrb- 678,000 square-foot -rrb- factory .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change .

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .
however karadzic 's close aide and wartime general ratko mladic still remains at large . candidacy linked to mladic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic arrest : " milestone " for serbia 's eu aspirations the eu said it would wait for war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz to report on whether serbia was fully cooperating with the un tribunal , before taking any concrete steps towards belgrade 's aspirations for eu membership . " i encourage this new government of serbia to continue its efforts in order to clear the hurdles from the european union road completely , " barroso said .
" it is important to ensure full cooperation with international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- he added that karadzic 's arrest was an " historic moment and a milestone for serbia 's european aspirations . " since being sworn in for a second presidential term in february , tadic , a pro-western leader who is a strong proponent of serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , has been rapidly moving his country in the path towards eu integration .
the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .
" we are going to continue our cooperation with the hague tribunal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu nations recognise kosovo , but not belgrade tadic said his administration was " doing everything possible to find mladic , and i promise that we 're going to continue our cooperation with the tribunal . " the afp news agency , however , cited a bosnian daily newspaper report last month in which mladic was already in talks with serbia 's secret services about his surrender . eu and serbia divide over kosovo tadic also stressed his country 's need to ratify the stabilization and association agreement , which was signed with the eu in belgrade last april .
the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .
most eu nations and the united states have recognized the predominantly ethnic albanian enclave that unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february after nearly a decade under un administration . belgrade sees the region as an integral part of serbia . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .

the company will be taken over by hans losinger , whose first task will be overseeing the construction of the 63,000 square-meter -lrb- 678,000 square-foot -rrb- factory .
one of the main goals of the factory will be changing the material used in the fuselages from aluminum to carbon fiber . the new factory in augsburg should be complete by 2011 , and the first a350s are expected to be delivered by 2013 . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

the firm 's headquarters was searched by the internal security agency . among the items found in the raid were nazi replicas including swastikas , military insignia and rings with skulls like those worn by nazi germany 's ss troops .
according to the polska newspaper , the items were produced for a german citizen from the former east germany .
the distribution or wearing of nazi-era symbols is banned in germany . " it is legal to produce such items for the needs of film producers or collectors , " klaus said . poland is europe 's biggest producer and exporter of nazi memorabilia .
most of the items are sold to neo-nazis in germany or scandinavia , polska said .
buying nazi symbols is illegal in those countries , but allowed in poland .
ss emblems and swastika armbands can be purchased at markets in poland 's larger cities . business is also booming on the internet , with one polish auction web site offering some 600 items .
a complete ss officer 's uniform goes for 3,000 zloty -lrb- $ 1,400 or 890 euros -rrb- , while iron crosses cost 15 zloty and are often sold in bulk , polska said . polish law forbids promoting nazi ideology , said klaus , but not selling historic mementos or reproductions .

3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .

the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 03.09.2008 analysis : europe hopes to reduce russian energy dependency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders want to loosen russia 's control over oil and gas this week 's eu summit declaration on georgia was kept markedly short when it came to energy .
but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .

piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .

although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .

as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .
hugh pope , an istanbul-based senior analyst with the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , told reuters that cyprus 's admission to the eu in 2004 has offered islanders an element of security lacking in past negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split in two since 1983 but there are some islanders who believe it will take nothing short of a miracle for the negotiations to be successful . " i 'm not sure i want to live with -lrb- turkish cypriots -rrb- again , " stella stavrides , a greek cypriot , told reuters .
" i 'd like a solution but it would be very difficult .
i 'm not sure i can trust the turks . " turkish cypriot emine hussein said that he tries to be hopeful , but that he doubts the talks will lead anywhere .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .
they started an underground organization -lrb- eoka -rrb- to fight against the british and their turkish collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations has set up a buffer zone between the north and south london gave up control of the island in 1960 .
as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .
hugh pope , an istanbul-based senior analyst with the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , told reuters that cyprus 's admission to the eu in 2004 has offered islanders an element of security lacking in past negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split in two since 1983 but there are some islanders who believe it will take nothing short of a miracle for the negotiations to be successful . " i 'm not sure i want to live with -lrb- turkish cypriots -rrb- again , " stella stavrides , a greek cypriot , told reuters .
" i 'd like a solution but it would be very difficult .
i 'm not sure i can trust the turks . " turkish cypriot emine hussein said that he tries to be hopeful , but that he doubts the talks will lead anywhere . " we did our bit and said yes -lrb- in a 2004 referendum to reunite , which the greek cypriots rejected -rrb- and we were very disappointed , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ah / mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .

" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9801 environment the next round of global climate change talks kicks off in cancun at the end of the month .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .

peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9798 china-eu the eu-china summit ended without a press conference .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models .

according to a company spokesman , some 360 million euros -lrb- $ 518 million -rrb- will be invested in the augsburg and nordenham plants . a new 180 million-euro plant will be built in the southern german city of augsburg .
according to the augsburg plant manager hans lonsinger , it will be the most modern of its type , producing fuselages for airbus a350 long-distance aircraft .
another 180 million euros will be invested in nordenham , on the north sea . originally eads wanted to get rid of the plants in order to minimize the a350 development risks .
the planned sale fell through at the end of march , however , due to the falling dollar and the turbulence in the international financial market .

according to a company spokesman , some 360 million euros -lrb- $ 518 million -rrb- will be invested in the augsburg and nordenham plants . a new 180 million-euro plant will be built in the southern german city of augsburg .
according to the augsburg plant manager hans lonsinger , it will be the most modern of its type , producing fuselages for airbus a350 long-distance aircraft .
another 180 million euros will be invested in nordenham , on the north sea . originally eads wanted to get rid of the plants in order to minimize the a350 development risks .
the planned sale fell through at the end of march , however , due to the falling dollar and the turbulence in the international financial market .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .

" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

the firm 's headquarters was searched by the internal security agency . among the items found in the raid were nazi replicas including swastikas , military insignia and rings with skulls like those worn by nazi germany 's ss troops .
according to the polska newspaper , the items were produced for a german citizen from the former east germany .
the distribution or wearing of nazi-era symbols is banned in germany . " it is legal to produce such items for the needs of film producers or collectors , " klaus said . poland is europe 's biggest producer and exporter of nazi memorabilia .

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .
however karadzic 's close aide and wartime general ratko mladic still remains at large . candidacy linked to mladic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic arrest : " milestone " for serbia 's eu aspirations the eu said it would wait for war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz to report on whether serbia was fully cooperating with the un tribunal , before taking any concrete steps towards belgrade 's aspirations for eu membership . " i encourage this new government of serbia to continue its efforts in order to clear the hurdles from the european union road completely , " barroso said .
" it is important to ensure full cooperation with international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- he added that karadzic 's arrest was an " historic moment and a milestone for serbia 's european aspirations .

3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .

the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 03.09.2008 analysis : europe hopes to reduce russian energy dependency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders want to loosen russia 's control over oil and gas this week 's eu summit declaration on georgia was kept markedly short when it came to energy .
but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de georgia moves closer to eu as russia split on summit results georgian premier lado gurgenidze thanked the european union for its support tuesday and called for closer ties with brussels .
russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit .
-lrb- 02.09.2008 -rrb- analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia .

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .

" i will use my right to dismiss parliament and announce early elections , " yushchenko said in a televised statement on wednesday , sept .
3 . orange allies turn into rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko 's bloc has grown closer with pro-russian factions in kyiv the accusations after members of tymoshenko 's bloc and the regions party of former prime minister viktor yanukovych voted together late on tuesday to reduce presidential powers . for her part , tymoshenko accused yushchenko of destroying the coalition and said he was seeking popular support before a presidential election due in 16 months and urged his party to come back to the coalition . " you have 10 days of no ultimatums , no demands , no provocations , to come back to the democratic coalition , " she said in a televised statement . under the constitution , the coalition has 10 days to work out its differences .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .
they started an underground organization -lrb- eoka -rrb- to fight against the british and their turkish collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations has set up a buffer zone between the north and south london gave up control of the island in 1960 .
as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .
hugh pope , an istanbul-based senior analyst with the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , told reuters that cyprus 's admission to the eu in 2004 has offered islanders an element of security lacking in past negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split in two since 1983 but there are some islanders who believe it will take nothing short of a miracle for the negotiations to be successful . " i 'm not sure i want to live with -lrb- turkish cypriots -rrb- again , " stella stavrides , a greek cypriot , told reuters .
" i 'd like a solution but it would be very difficult .
i 'm not sure i can trust the turks . " turkish cypriot emine hussein said that he tries to be hopeful , but that he doubts the talks will lead anywhere .

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance .

some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .

the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .

although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .

as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .
hugh pope , an istanbul-based senior analyst with the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , told reuters that cyprus 's admission to the eu in 2004 has offered islanders an element of security lacking in past negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split in two since 1983 but there are some islanders who believe it will take nothing short of a miracle for the negotiations to be successful . " i 'm not sure i want to live with -lrb- turkish cypriots -rrb- again , " stella stavrides , a greek cypriot , told reuters .
" i 'd like a solution but it would be very difficult .
i 'm not sure i can trust the turks . " turkish cypriot emine hussein said that he tries to be hopeful , but that he doubts the talks will lead anywhere . " we did our bit and said yes -lrb- in a 2004 referendum to reunite , which the greek cypriots rejected -rrb- and we were very disappointed , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ah / mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change .

the internal security agency searched the company 's headquarters , spokeswoman for the polish prosecutor , malgorzata klaus , told the pap news agency .
the firm 's headquarters was searched by the internal security agency . among the items found in the raid were nazi replicas including swastikas , military insignia and rings with skulls like those worn by nazi germany 's ss troops .
according to the polska newspaper , the items were produced for a german citizen from the former east germany .
the distribution or wearing of nazi-era symbols is banned in germany . " it is legal to produce such items for the needs of film producers or collectors , " klaus said . poland is europe 's biggest producer and exporter of nazi memorabilia .
most of the items are sold to neo-nazis in germany or scandinavia , polska said .
buying nazi symbols is illegal in those countries , but allowed in poland .
ss emblems and swastika armbands can be purchased at markets in poland 's larger cities . business is also booming on the internet , with one polish auction web site offering some 600 items .
a complete ss officer 's uniform goes for 3,000 zloty -lrb- $ 1,400 or 890 euros -rrb- , while iron crosses cost 15 zloty and are often sold in bulk , polska said . polish law forbids promoting nazi ideology , said klaus , but not selling historic mementos or reproductions .

yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .

the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .

the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 03.09.2008 cambodia 's fishing industry is ailing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen on the mekong river cambodia is home to some of the world ’ s most intensive freshwater fisheries .
the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9797 interview suu kyi calls for more support from europe the burmese civil rights activist talks to dw in an exclusive interview .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .
they started an underground organization -lrb- eoka -rrb- to fight against the british and their turkish collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations has set up a buffer zone between the north and south london gave up control of the island in 1960 .
as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .
hugh pope , an istanbul-based senior analyst with the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , told reuters that cyprus 's admission to the eu in 2004 has offered islanders an element of security lacking in past negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split in two since 1983 but there are some islanders who believe it will take nothing short of a miracle for the negotiations to be successful . " i 'm not sure i want to live with -lrb- turkish cypriots -rrb- again , " stella stavrides , a greek cypriot , told reuters .
" i 'd like a solution but it would be very difficult .
i 'm not sure i can trust the turks . " turkish cypriot emine hussein said that he tries to be hopeful , but that he doubts the talks will lead anywhere . " we did our bit and said yes -lrb- in a 2004 referendum to reunite , which the greek cypriots rejected -rrb- and we were very disappointed , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ah / mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

replacing car ferries that depart half-hourly round the clock will take about an hour off the 4.5-hour , straight-line motorway drive from the danish capital copenhagen to the german city of hamburg .
german and danish ministers were signed a treaty in copenhagen wednesday , authorizing the bridge between the little danish port of rodby and the german island of fehmarn .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .

" since being sworn in for a second presidential term in february , tadic , a pro-western leader who is a strong proponent of serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , has been rapidly moving his country in the path towards eu integration .
the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .

the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

" i will use my right to dismiss parliament and announce early elections , " yushchenko said in a televised statement on wednesday , sept .

" you have 10 days of no ultimatums , no demands , no provocations , to come back to the democratic coalition , " she said in a televised statement . under the constitution , the coalition has 10 days to work out its differences .
after that , if parliament does not create a new coalition within 30 days , yushchenko can call an election . if the parliament is dissolved , ukraine could be facing its third parliamentary election since the 2004 orange revolution that swept yushchenko to power on the promise of strengthening ties with the european union and the united states that includes ultimately joining the eu club and nato . the former orange revolution allies are now bitter rivals , likely to square off in the 2010 presidential election . deal with moscow ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko accused his former ally of making a pact not to fault russia for the georgia war yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of not backing tbilisi when russians troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia in the caucasus conflict . political observers have expressed concern that kremlin might try to capitalize on the political instability in ukraine , which is strategically critical to the west for the pipelines that carry russian gas to european consumers . however the deepening political crisis seemed to have at least as much impact on the money markets with investors nervous about the geopolitical risk of doing business in the former soviet bloc following last month ’ s military conflict in caucasus region .

replacing car ferries that depart half-hourly round the clock will take about an hour off the 4.5-hour , straight-line motorway drive from the danish capital copenhagen to the german city of hamburg .
german and danish ministers were signed a treaty in copenhagen wednesday , authorizing the bridge between the little danish port of rodby and the german island of fehmarn .
" we 'll obstruct the project in the courts any way we can , " said nabu 's national secretary , leif miller , in remarks quoted by the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel .
bridge given initial green light the project closes one of the last bridgeable gaps in the landmass occupied by the european union and will also benefit sweden , which is already connected to denmark by the oresund mega-bridge .
fixed links already exist , but involve a detour via the jutland peninsula .
the signatures were to be placed on the agreement by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and his danish counterpart carina christensen in copenhagen on wednesday .
the project forms part of a larger infrastructure project which the danish parliament agreed tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .
they started an underground organization -lrb- eoka -rrb- to fight against the british and their turkish collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations has set up a buffer zone between the north and south london gave up control of the island in 1960 .
as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .

while many doubt they will be successful , some say it 's the island 's best chance in a generation . leaders from cyprus ' turkish and greek sides met for two hours on wednesday , sept .
3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .
they started an underground organization -lrb- eoka -rrb- to fight against the british and their turkish collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations has set up a buffer zone between the north and south london gave up control of the island in 1960 .
as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .

research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag .

mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ?

both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .

" we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
the african blogosphere is small but growing and cedric kalonji is one of its veterans .
a blogger in the democratic republic of congo , kalonji won the best weblog award for french at last year 's best of the blogs , hosted by deutsche welle .
since winning the award , kalonji said that he has received a lot more traffic to his site and is being asked by other bloggers around africa for advice .
" my blog is a lot more well known now than it was .
i have been getting a lot of visitors and emails , " said kalonji .
to meet this increased demand and to help open blogging to more of his countrymen , kalonji is working to develop a new blogging platform for congolese bloggers . skipping the pc while the blogging scene is quite active in countries like the democratic republic of congo , cameroon or the ivory coast , the situation is much different in other parts of africa .
in mali , for example , computers and the internet remain inaccessible to much of the population due to the cost .
but new technologies are slowly catching on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese blogger and bobs winner cedric kalonji " in africa , most people use a mobile phone to send messages , photos or videos , and they can be sent easily to a circle of contacts , " said jeanne mercier , head of the photographer exchange platform " afrique in visu . "
" so at the same time users can inform themselves about the latest trends , whether it 's some great videos , the presidential election in mali or religious topics , " she said .
a lot of experts are predicting that african bloggers will leapfrog over the pc platform right to the mobile platform , using tools like the micro-blogging platform twitter .
" even though africa was very late in building technology infrastructure , this can be a chance to develop new technologies , " said jean-michel cornu , chief scientist at the next generation internet foundation -lrb- fing -rrb- in france .
" it is our goal to inform local decision makers as much as possible about new technologies so that eventually the price if the infrastructure will go down , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lack of infrastructure in africa is keeping the information superhighway from much of the continent .
but by embracing new , mobile technologies , many africans are using their mobile phones as a personal pc . nomination for deutsche welle 's international weblog award begins on aug .
31 .
the african blogosphere is small but growing and cedric kalonji is one of its veterans .
a blogger in the democratic republic of congo , kalonji won the best weblog award for french at last year 's best of the blogs , hosted by deutsche welle .
since winning the award , kalonji said that he has received a lot more traffic to his site and is being asked by other bloggers around africa for advice .
" my blog is a lot more well known now than it was .
i have been getting a lot of visitors and emails , " said kalonji .
to meet this increased demand and to help open blogging to more of his countrymen , kalonji is working to develop a new blogging platform for congolese bloggers . skipping the pc while the blogging scene is quite active in countries like the democratic republic of congo , cameroon or the ivory coast , the situation is much different in other parts of africa .
in mali , for example , computers and the internet remain inaccessible to much of the population due to the cost .
but new technologies are slowly catching on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congolese blogger and bobs winner cedric kalonji " in africa , most people use a mobile phone to send messages , photos or videos , and they can be sent easily to a circle of contacts , " said jeanne mercier , head of the photographer exchange platform " afrique in visu . "
" so at the same time users can inform themselves about the latest trends , whether it 's some great videos , the presidential election in mali or religious topics , " she said .
a lot of experts are predicting that african bloggers will leapfrog over the pc platform right to the mobile platform , using tools like the micro-blogging platform twitter .
" even though africa was very late in building technology infrastructure , this can be a chance to develop new technologies , " said jean-michel cornu , chief scientist at the next generation internet foundation -lrb- fing -rrb- in france .
" it is our goal to inform local decision makers as much as possible about new technologies so that eventually the price if the infrastructure will go down , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , in the un-controlled zone that separates the two communities , to try and iron out a decade long dispute . observers are hoping that greek cypriot dimitris christofias , the president of cyprus , and turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat will be able to settle a feud which has long defied international efforts and threatens to undermine turkey 's european union aspirations . christofias said the leaders had a " common will and common desire " to reach an agreement , though he warned that " there are no guarantees . " talat , however , said " we are confident we will succeed in concluding a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible and hopefully this year . "
he added that ankara is supporting the solution , thus pushing aside speculation that turkey , as a guarantor of the island 's 1960 independence agreement , could block a settlement . both leaders said any agreed solution would be put to separate , simultaneous referenda in the north and south . " genuine commitment " a diplomat close to the negotiations , speaking on conditions of anonymity , told reuters news agency that this is the best chance cyprus has had in a generation . " both leaders are genuinely committed for a deal , and that is what was lacking before , " he said ahead of the meeting . both sides will focus on the complex list of issues dividing the two sides , meeting at the site of the abandoned , bullet-riddled former airport in the un buffer zone , ranging from territory and property disputes from more than 250,000 people who have lost their homes to future governance of the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimetris christofias was elected president of cyprus in february several mediators have tried to come up with a solution for the mediterranean island , but all have failed .
both sides have agreed to reunite as a bi-zonal , bi-communal federation , but their opinions differ on how this might work . turkish cypriots , whose breakaway state is only recognized by turkey , would like a merging of two sovereign states .
however , the greek cypriots , who run the island 's internationally recognized government , are adamant in their refusal to concede any sort of sovereignty to the island 's north . strategic location greeks and turks have been living at odds with one another since cyprus attained independence from great britain .
as a strategic point in the eastern mediterranean , cyprus has always been a highly prized piece of land .
the british , who were granted power over the administration of the island in 1878 after the russo-turkish war , used cyprus as a naval base during world war i. in 1925 the island was declared a british crown colony .
although the turkish mainland is closer to cyprus , the island has long had a greek majority .
however , the british placed the turkish minority in charge , deepening the rift between the two ethnic groups . greek ties the island 's greek population saw their salvation in enosis - an annexation by the greek motherland .
they started an underground organization -lrb- eoka -rrb- to fight against the british and their turkish collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations has set up a buffer zone between the north and south london gave up control of the island in 1960 .
as a way of protecting the turkish minority , a constitution was drawn up , guaranteeing that government offices and posts would be filled by ethnic quotas and giving the turkish cypriots a permanent veto .
in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .
hugh pope , an istanbul-based senior analyst with the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , told reuters that cyprus 's admission to the eu in 2004 has offered islanders an element of security lacking in past negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split in two since 1983 but there are some islanders who believe it will take nothing short of a miracle for the negotiations to be successful . " i 'm not sure i want to live with -lrb- turkish cypriots -rrb- again , " stella stavrides , a greek cypriot , told reuters .
" i 'd like a solution but it would be very difficult .
i 'm not sure i can trust the turks . " turkish cypriot emine hussein said that he tries to be hopeful , but that he doubts the talks will lead anywhere . " we did our bit and said yes -lrb- in a 2004 referendum to reunite , which the greek cypriots rejected -rrb- and we were very disappointed , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ah / mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .
i would like to hail the courage of the syrian and israeli leaders , and hail turkey 's significant role . " dpa news agency -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1963 inter-communal violence broke out on both sides , and was only stopped when the un sent in peace keepers . in 1974 the greek military government in power in athens declared a coup on the island , installing nikos sampson as president of cyprus .
in retaliation , turkey invaded , claiming they had they right to restore constitutional order . islanders divided political analysts remain optimistic .

on wednesday , sarkozy joins syria 's al-assad and others for peace talks . french president nicolas sarkozy said that " peace in the middle east passes through france and syria " and that his visit to syria sent a friendship message to the syrian people .
" syria can present a significant help in solving issues in the middle east , " sarkozy told the syrian al-watan daily newspaper tuesday , on the eve of a high-profile visit to damascus .
" it is important that syria would play a positive role in the -lrb- middle east -rrb- region , " added the french president in the interview published wednesday .
sarkozy currently holds the six month presidency of the european union , but the visit appeared to be bilateral in nature .
sarkozy 's visit aims at strengthening bilateral relations , which were frozen after the murder in february 2005 of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq al-hariri , who was a close friend of former french president jacques chirac .
damascus was accused of being behind al-hariri 's murder , but syria has denied the charge .
syrian president bashar al-assad paid a visit to paris last july during the start of the french eu presidency and said his country was ready to have diplomatic relations with lebanon .
in august , lebanon and syria agreed to establish diplomatic relations during a visit by lebanese president michel suleiman to damascus .
" new chapter " in french-syrian relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has mediated peace talks between syria and israel " our countries open a new chapter in their relations , " sarkozy said , describing the new chapter as " precious . "
" our friendship is a priceless fortune that should be preserved at any cost , " he told the semi-official newspaper .
sarkozy will join a four-way summit on middle east peace on thursday with al-assad and regional mediators turkey and qatar .
qatar brokered a deal last may to resolve lebanon 's political crisis , while turkey has been mediating indirect peace talks between syria and israel since may .
" the indirect talks between syria and israel are an excellent thing for the two countries , the region and the entire world , " sarkozy was quoted as saying .
" it 's not easy to achieve peace because it requires a lot of effort and strong will .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 03.09.2008 analysis : europe hopes to reduce russian energy dependency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders want to loosen russia 's control over oil and gas this week 's eu summit declaration on georgia was kept markedly short when it came to energy .
but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the compensation paid to the families of the dead afghan civilians and the removal of a german commander have sent a clear message : germany 's reputation in hindu kush is at stake . however , defense minister franz josef jung 's crisis diplomacy is also an opportunity .
germany has the chance to finally get a handle on the afghan reality . though war has n't affected every part of the north , the military conflicts bear traces of guerrilla tactics where the underdog is inflicting increasingly painful pinpricks on an alliance that is bristling with arrogance . and the soldiers ?
they are overwhelmed and are responding with panic .
it 's no wonder , since most of them have been trained to see a potential culprit in every afghan who approaches them .
but they ca n't win any " hearts and minds " that way . ambiguous responsibilities the mood in afghanistan has , in fact , changed in the past few months .
for the afghan population , it 's no longer apparent where the fight against terror , which nato let itself be pulled into by the us military , actually ends .
the german defense minister has called it a problem of " ambiguous responsibilities . " an alliance that stands up for general human rights but turns out civilian victims every week spreads fear and mistrust instead of security . the afghan human rights commission is already speaking of war crimes and for the population it 's more and more difficult to differentiate between " good " and " bad " foreigners .
the bundeswehr is facing a conflict on two fronts . now is the time to keep a clear head .
a hasty withdrawal of the bundeswehr would send the wrong signal .
the afghan army and policy force have a right to be trained , just as the west promised . after all , an effective afghan defense force is the ticket home for german troops .
it must be clear to everyone by now that it 's a long road .
and there are lots of reasons the police training needs to be rigorous , although the german trainers have always denied this . a premature withdrawal would leave behind a power vacuum that would be filled by the taliban , criminals and former warlords .
it would be the opposite of the " sustainability " that donor countries like to use as a catch phrase . sending thousands of reinforcements , as is currently being discussed , would be just as wrong .
the soviet army did n't manage to get the country under control with 200,000 soldiers .
so the 1,000 additional german troops envisaged in berlin 's new afghanistan mandate do n't make much sense . strategy of politics what 's needed is a strategy from the west that emphasizes politics over military .
it 's a fallacy to believe that , under the current circumstances , the military can pave the way for civilian reconstruction in all areas . the other factor that affects the security of german troops in afghanistan is n't even part of the bundeswehr .
it 's in pakistan .
here , everyone - especially the us - is called on to increase diplomatic pressure on the pakistani army and secret service . the brew that is spreading harm is not coming from afghanistan , but from its eastern neighbor . finally , many jobs need to be created in afghanistan and corruption needs to be reduced , both on the afghan and the international side . if president karzai is indeed voted out in the coming elections , then it would be a vote against the west . martin gerner is a deutsche welle expert on afghanistan -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 03.09.2008 analysis : europe hopes to reduce russian energy dependency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders want to loosen russia 's control over oil and gas this week 's eu summit declaration on georgia was kept markedly short when it came to energy .
but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

replacing car ferries that depart half-hourly round the clock will take about an hour off the 4.5-hour , straight-line motorway drive from the danish capital copenhagen to the german city of hamburg .
german and danish ministers were signed a treaty in copenhagen wednesday , authorizing the bridge between the little danish port of rodby and the german island of fehmarn .
" we 'll obstruct the project in the courts any way we can , " said nabu 's national secretary , leif miller , in remarks quoted by the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel .
bridge given initial green light the project closes one of the last bridgeable gaps in the landmass occupied by the european union and will also benefit sweden , which is already connected to denmark by the oresund mega-bridge .
fixed links already exist , but involve a detour via the jutland peninsula .
the signatures were to be placed on the agreement by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and his danish counterpart carina christensen in copenhagen on wednesday .
the project forms part of a larger infrastructure project which the danish parliament agreed tuesday .
total costs are estimated at 5.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.1 billion -rrb- .
the danish government is to contribute 4.8 billion euros .
the costs will be recouped by introducing a toll .

some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

other differences between brussels and belgrade run from trade to kosovo . belgrade stressed the need to ratify a trade agreement with the eu , but disagrees with eu on kosovo . serbia could get eu candidate status in 2009 , said european commission president jose manuel barroso at a brussels news briefing on wednesday , sept .
3 , with serbian president boris tadic in attendance . " it would be possible to give candidate status to serbia , but this is not a commitment , " barroso said .
" it depends on conditions being fulfilled . " among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .

" i encourage this new government of serbia to continue its efforts in order to clear the hurdles from the european union road completely , " barroso said .
" it is important to ensure full cooperation with international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- he added that karadzic 's arrest was an " historic moment and a milestone for serbia 's european aspirations . " since being sworn in for a second presidential term in february , tadic , a pro-western leader who is a strong proponent of serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , has been rapidly moving his country in the path towards eu integration .
the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .
" we are going to continue our cooperation with the hague tribunal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu nations recognise kosovo , but not belgrade tadic said his administration was " doing everything possible to find mladic , and i promise that we 're going to continue our cooperation with the tribunal . " the afp news agency , however , cited a bosnian daily newspaper report last month in which mladic was already in talks with serbia 's secret services about his surrender . eu and serbia divide over kosovo tadic also stressed his country 's need to ratify the stabilization and association agreement , which was signed with the eu in belgrade last april .
the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

" among the conditions is serbia 's cooperation with the un 's international criminal court in the hague , where former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic is being tried for wartime crimes . serbian leaders had hoped that karadzic 's arrest in july after 13 years in hiding would be a first step towards eu membership .
however karadzic 's close aide and wartime general ratko mladic still remains at large . candidacy linked to mladic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic arrest : " milestone " for serbia 's eu aspirations the eu said it would wait for war crimes prosecutor serge brammertz to report on whether serbia was fully cooperating with the un tribunal , before taking any concrete steps towards belgrade 's aspirations for eu membership . " i encourage this new government of serbia to continue its efforts in order to clear the hurdles from the european union road completely , " barroso said .
" it is important to ensure full cooperation with international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- he added that karadzic 's arrest was an " historic moment and a milestone for serbia 's european aspirations . " since being sworn in for a second presidential term in february , tadic , a pro-western leader who is a strong proponent of serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , has been rapidly moving his country in the path towards eu integration .
the serbian government hopes to qualify for eu candidacy by early next year , a path it hopes will conclude with full membership by 2014 . bosnian report that mladic negotiating his surrender " serbia is going to do everything possible to speed up this process , " said tadic on his first visit to brussels since being re-elected .
" we are going to continue our cooperation with the hague tribunal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu nations recognise kosovo , but not belgrade tadic said his administration was " doing everything possible to find mladic , and i promise that we 're going to continue our cooperation with the tribunal . " the afp news agency , however , cited a bosnian daily newspaper report last month in which mladic was already in talks with serbia 's secret services about his surrender . eu and serbia divide over kosovo tadic also stressed his country 's need to ratify the stabilization and association agreement , which was signed with the eu in belgrade last april .
the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .
most eu nations and the united states have recognized the predominantly ethnic albanian enclave that unilaterally declared its independence from serbia in february after nearly a decade under un administration . belgrade sees the region as an integral part of serbia . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the distribution or wearing of nazi-era symbols is banned in germany . " it is legal to produce such items for the needs of film producers or collectors , " klaus said . poland is europe 's biggest producer and exporter of nazi memorabilia .
most of the items are sold to neo-nazis in germany or scandinavia , polska said .
buying nazi symbols is illegal in those countries , but allowed in poland .
ss emblems and swastika armbands can be purchased at markets in poland 's larger cities . business is also booming on the internet , with one polish auction web site offering some 600 items .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.09.2008 fuel cells not exciting car makers in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some car makers are ready to introduce fuel cell vehicles , others are n't so sure rising petrol prices and environmental ills are a fine argument in favor of fuel cell cars driven by electric power generated from hydrogen .
yet oddly , carmakers are not currently singing the praises of this technology . it sounds almost too good to be true , but cars which run on hydrogen fuel cells emit only water vapor into the atmosphere and in contrast to oil , hydrogen is not a fossil fuel with only limited reserves .
in fact it is the most common element on the planet . car manufacturers are seemingly uneasy about propagating this form of motive power .
research has been going on for decades and numerous breakthroughs have been announced .
so far though , only a handful of prototypes and some limited series production vehicles have appeared . ford spokeswoman monika wagener in cologne said that a volume fuel cell car is not practicable in the near future .
this did not mean that the technology was a mere public relations gag . " the fact that the large companies are investing in this technology in a big way shows that they mean business , " wagener said , adding that nearly all the carmakers are probing the fuel cell . two sides of the coin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler ag , the maker of mercedes , believes fuel cell technology is very promising a fuel cell car is basically an electric vehicle since the fuel cell stack is used to combine hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen .
the chemical energy from the reaction is then converted into electric power which drives the vehicle . matthias brock from daimler in stuttgart said he believes that the fuel cell is very promising when it comes to zero-emission driving in local areas .
mercedes has around 100 test vehicles underway - the world 's largest fleet of fuel cell vehicles .
the company is currently working on a b-class with fuel cell power which could be produced in limited numbers from 2010 . " we estimate that between 2012 and 2015 the car could be ready for series production , " brock said . other manufacturers , such as volkswagen in wolfsburg , are more reserved about committing themselves to future fuel cell models . " we expect fuel cell power to come on stream after 2020 , " said hartmuth hoffmann at volkswagen in wolfsburg . taming hydrogen does pose engineers with a complex set of problems , including how to produce it , how to transport the substance to customers and last but not least : " how can it best be stored on-board ? " according to hoffman , " there are some basically very sound ideas out there but these are not yet suitable for volume production . " filling up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg and berlin are the only german cities to have usable numbers of hydrogen filling stations assuming fuel cell technology had matured sufficiently for everyday use , owners would be hard put to find somewhere to fill their vehicle tanks .
fuel outlets are a rarity .
both the german cities of hamburg and berlin are involved in a pilot project called " clean energy partnership , , which is designed to probe the regular usage of hydrogen as a fuel yet , apart from this exemplary project , there are hardly any hydrogen fuelling facilities in the country . the need for fuel outlets in close proximity is one of the reasons why field trials using fuel cell vehicles tend to take place in the united states where filling stations are more plentiful .
japanese maker honda is gearing up to market 200 examples of the fcx clarity model over the next three years and will offer them to commercial partners on a leasing basis . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to introduce onto us roads 100 fuel cell prototypes in a us-based project called " driveway " , gm technical spokesman andrew marshall confirmed .
gm believes too that fuel cell cars are a long way from entering the showrooms . " having said that , the fuel cell offers the only truly zero-emission drive system around , " marshall said .
" at the moment we can not see an alternative . " emission standards whether cars need to be completely emission-free is another issue .
andreas ostermeier from the german federal environment ministry in dessau said that the notion of zero-emissions is an irrelevance .
petrol and diesel engines no longer pose a threat to air quality . petrol engines which comply with the euro-4 standard laid down by the european union use the latest technology to reduce toxins to levels far below those of even a decade ago .
the same will apply to diesels when euro 6 becomes legally binding from 2014 . " nowadays fuel consumption and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions are at the top of the agenda , " ostermeier said . cost analysis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrogen is a difficult fuel to isolate , making it expensive hydrogen is complex to produce which puts the fuel at a further disadvantage as conventional fuels continue to get cleaner .
it is also an expensive fuel source as one example shows .
hydrogen can be gained by using steam to reform natural gas . " the trouble is that so much energy is used to drive the process that it is cheaper to pump the methane gas used straight into a gas-powered car , " ostermeier said . the german expert does not share the car industry 's optimism that one day it will be possible to produce sufficient hydrogen using renewable energy derived from wind , biodegradable refuse and hydro generation . ostermeier said it could take until 2030 before enough electricity from renewable sources becomes available .
from an overall energy point of view it was probably better to rely until then on conventionally-powered cars , especially since the coming years are set to see the arrival of electric cars with far more efficient batteries and a wider range than those currently on the market . dirk breuer from toyota germany in cologne said he believes there is no single path to zero-emission vehicles . " many roads lead to this destination , " he said . in regions such as south america , bio-fuels could be the most viable alternative whereas in highly-populated urban regions in western europe the pure electric car offers the most potential for the future . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 03.09.2008 cambodia 's fishing industry is ailing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen on the mekong river cambodia is home to some of the world ’ s most intensive freshwater fisheries .
the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the trade and political pact , which fosters closer ties with the eu , has been frozen pending serbia 's cooperation with the hague tribunal . barroso said the progress tadic 's government had made " should be reflected on " by member states in implementing the trade-related part of the agreement . however , one matter which remains non-negotiable for the serbian leadership is independence for the breakaway province of kosovo .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

replacing car ferries that depart half-hourly round the clock will take about an hour off the 4.5-hour , straight-line motorway drive from the danish capital copenhagen to the german city of hamburg .
german and danish ministers were signed a treaty in copenhagen wednesday , authorizing the bridge between the little danish port of rodby and the german island of fehmarn .
" we 'll obstruct the project in the courts any way we can , " said nabu 's national secretary , leif miller , in remarks quoted by the berlin newspaper der tagesspiegel .
bridge given initial green light the project closes one of the last bridgeable gaps in the landmass occupied by the european union and will also benefit sweden , which is already connected to denmark by the oresund mega-bridge .
fixed links already exist , but involve a detour via the jutland peninsula .
the signatures were to be placed on the agreement by german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and his danish counterpart carina christensen in copenhagen on wednesday .
the project forms part of a larger infrastructure project which the danish parliament agreed tuesday .
total costs are estimated at 5.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.1 billion -rrb- .
the danish government is to contribute 4.8 billion euros .
the costs will be recouped by introducing a toll .

along with floods , lack of snow and an increase of algae along the coast , this could all be in germany 's climate future . germany - like most the world - is in for some warmer weather .
that 's the conclusion of a report by the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg .
by the end of the century the average annual temperature in germany will be three degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- warmer than in the period between 1971 and 2000 . such a change in temperatures would mean a sinking water table and an increase in heat-related illnesses in southern and southwestern germany .
on the positive side , the warmer weather would mean better grape harvests and finer wine . climate change has already had an affect on the glaciers covering the alps , and experts said it 's going to get worse .
by 2100 there will be no snowfall in the alps below 1,500 meters -lrb- 4,900 feet -rrb- , according to the study , which was commissioned by the german environment ministry . a temperature difference of three degrees celsius could mean that large areas of the alps that are sure to get snow by today 's standards will likely remain green in 2100 . rainfall across germany could drop by as much as 30 percent with the south and southwest hit hardest , but winter precipitation could increase by up to a third , the study found . temperature changes in northern germany wo n't be quite as dramatic though flooding may change the landscape along the elbe river .
researchers also predicted a boom for the northern german tourist industry as warmer temperatures are likely to send more people to the north and baltic seas . the study 's results pushed greens party politician baerbel hoehn to call more action in the fight against climate change . " the government has to come clean about the problems and costs that climate change is going to cause , " she told the afp news agency , adding that so far merkel has " turned away from every measure that might upset any lobby .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 03.09.2008 analysis : europe hopes to reduce russian energy dependency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders want to loosen russia 's control over oil and gas this week 's eu summit declaration on georgia was kept markedly short when it came to energy .
but the two sentences contain an important message for european leaders on diversifying energy suppliers . section 9 of the eu summit declaration on georgia was a mere two sentences .
the first said , " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " the council of ministers and the european commission should examine ways to diversify energy sources and supply routes , it added . eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs told journalists on tuesday , sept .
2 , that the summit 's decision will strengthen and accelerate the policy we have launched .
piebalgs said he plans to present his revised strategy for europe 's energy policy by early november . his spokesman , ferran tarradellas , pointed out that the eu commission raised the alarm in 2000 when it warned that europe had to reduce dependency on energy imports . german chancellor angela merkel stressed at the brussels meeting that new energy resources were needed - a point that met with general acceptance . " no one who spoke at the meeting ignored that , " said poland 's prime minister donald tusk after the talks on monday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets a lot of its gas through russian pipelines both germany and poland are highly reliant on russian energy supplies .
some 39 percent of germany 's natural gas and 32 percent of its oil needs in 2006 were met by russia , according to the international energy agency .
in poland , the figures are considerably higher : 46 percent for gas and 90 percent for oil . eu members like slovakia or lithuania obtained their entire gas imports and also almost 100 percent of their oil from russia .
dependency on russian gas is just as high in estonia , finland and - to a lesser extent - in bulgaria . oil is also shipped to europe from other continents .
for gas , the eu is expanding imports from norway and algeria , two of its major suppliers . keeping oil out of russia ’ s hands the nabucco pipeline from austria to turkey is intended to provide a gas link towards the caspian sea , iran and via syria as far as egypt .
work on the pipeline is earmarked to begin later this year and be finished by 2012 .
this project is part of the reason why the european union has a strong strategic interest in georgia . every pipeline that avoids russian soil and control is welcomed in europe .
but diversification can also mean something else , as it emerged from the brussels talks . while the geographic location of pipelines was a topic of discussion , some participants took the opportunity to emphasize the necessity of diversification that could include nuclear energy , said one summit participant . french prime minister nicolas sarkozy , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , has long been lobbying for france 's nuclear industry . the eu commission officially leaves nuclear politics to the member states and wants to promote diversification via renewable energy , tarradellas said , adding that spain was increasingly using solar power instead of gas for heating . wind energy also helped reduce dependency on imports .
top priority , though , was energy efficiency . " it is much better for us to invest in double glazing than in natural gas , " tarradellas said . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media pakistani taliban a suicide attack on a paramilitary academy to avenge bin laden 's death has killed dozens .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry india-pakistan islamabad has banned the export of onions to india , saying there is a shortage in pakistan .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .
most cambodians rely on fish as a source of affordable protein .
cambodia has the world ’ s highest annual per person fish catch - 20 kilos .
whereas in china the figure is one kilo per person and in india it is 1.5 kilos .
growing population in the last 60 years , cambodia ’ s fish production has doubled whereas its population has tripled .
pressure on the country ’ s fish resources has increased significantly - cambodia is close to reaching its maximum level of fish production .
another phenomenon is also contributing to the depletion of fish stocks in cambodian waters - selected overfishing .
peter degen from the united nations food and agriculture organisation explained that fish species which “ get to sexual maturity in more than a year , i.e. in two or three years ” were fished out of the “ water before being able to reproduce . ”
problems of human intervention some experts have also blamed illegal fishing in the closed season for the growing problems but dr eric baran , a fish biologist at the world fish centre , who has been working in the region for more than 10 years , thought human intervention was more to blame .
baran said that his impression was that the negative impact of fishing was “ overemphasized ” .
there was “ much more risk in terms of dambuilding or agricultural changes , ” he said .
growing industrialization in cambodia has led to many dam-building projects for generating electricity .
the dams have a devastating impact on fish resources because they interrupt the migration routes of the fish .
the conversion of floodplains into agricultural land and the use of pesticides in agriculture have also had extremely negative effects on the fishing industry .
negative impact on economy the region ’ s biodiversity is increasingly endangered by this human intervention .
consequently there are less big fish in cambodian waters and this is affecting the country ’ s economy .
a kilo of big fish fetches a higher market price than a kilo of small fish said degen : “ for a poor person , a kilo of animal protein is still a kilo of animal protein !
that ’ s right , but commercially , in terms of income , to sustain income as a fisher a fisher depends on the big fish .
but these fish are going down . ”
no alternatives for the poor once again , it seems to be the poor who are most hit by the problems that the fishing industry is suffering .
“ those who already have capital will have ways to adjust to declining fish and they will have ways to find alternatives , ” explained baran , “ but very poor people don ’ t have many alternatives because they have no land , they often have no capital to invest in other activities and they are left with no options ” so they have to rely on nature and its resources , which more and more are at the mercy of today ’ s fast-paced global modernization process . rey azizi 03/09/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic depleted fish stocks are changing cambodia 's traditional fishing industry 9799 health the world health organization has published its first report on neglected tropical diseases .

the 2.6 million tonnes of fish caught annually in the mekong basin represent seven times more than the catch of north american inland fisheries and more than 10 times the entire fish catch in australia .
as cambodia ’ s population grows , however , the fishing industry is coming increasingly under threat . fish production in cambodia is three times as big as the country ’ s pig production and 20 times bigger than its chicken production .

according to a company spokesman , some 360 million euros -lrb- $ 518 million -rrb- will be invested in the augsburg and nordenham plants . a new 180 million-euro plant will be built in the southern german city of augsburg .
according to the augsburg plant manager hans lonsinger , it will be the most modern of its type , producing fuselages for airbus a350 long-distance aircraft .
another 180 million euros will be invested in nordenham , on the north sea . originally eads wanted to get rid of the plants in order to minimize the a350 development risks .
the planned sale fell through at the end of march , however , due to the falling dollar and the turbulence in the international financial market .
despite the failed sale , eads still wants to form a new subsidiary called premium aerotec that will group together the two plants in augsburg , along with the plants in nordenham and varel , said the spokesman . " we ca n't just lay our hands in our laps and wait and see what happens , " he said . premium aerotec , which will be headquartered in augsburg , will have around 6,000 employees .
it is expected to have a yearly earning potential of 1.3 billion euros .
the company will be taken over by hans losinger , whose first task will be overseeing the construction of the 63,000 square-meter -lrb- 678,000 square-foot -rrb- factory .
one of the main goals of the factory will be changing the material used in the fuselages from aluminum to carbon fiber . the new factory in augsburg should be complete by 2011 , and the first a350s are expected to be delivered by 2013 . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media requires javascript to play .
senator lieberman on why he backs john mccain senator joe lieberman , the democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2000 but now an independent , has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota .
here is the text of his speech : thank you so very much for that warm welcome .
i am really honoured to be here .
as you well know , we meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that has hit the gulf coast but that hurts all of us , because we are all members of our larger american family .
at times like this , we set aside all that divides us , and we come together to help our fellow americans in need .
what matters is certainly not whether we are democrats or republicans , but that we are all americans .
the truth is , it should n't take a hurricane to bring us together like this .
every day , across our country , millions of our fellow citizens are facing huge problems .
they are worried about their homes , their jobs , and their businesses ; they are worried about the outrageous cost of gas and of health insurance ; and they are worried about the threats from our enemies abroad .
but when they look to washington , all too often they do not see their leaders coming together to tackle these problems .
instead they see democrats and republicans fighting each other , rather than fighting for the american people .
our founding fathers foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship .
in fact , george washington himself - in his farewell address to our country - warned that the " spirit of party " is " the worst enemy " of our democracy and " enfeebles " our government 's ability to do its job .
the president washington was absolutely right .
the truth is - today we are living through his worst nightmare , in the capital city that bears his name .
and that brings me directly to why i am here tonight .
what , after all , is a democrat like me doing at a republican convention like this ?
i 'll tell you what .
i 'm here to support john mccain because country matters more than party .
i 'm here tonight for a simple reason .
john mccain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward .
i 'm here tonight because john mccain 's whole life testifies to a great truth : being a democrat or a republican is important .
but it is nowhere near as important as being an american .
partisan paralysis i think you know that both presidential candidates this year talk about changing the culture of washington , about breaking through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics .
but only one of them has actually done it .
only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people .
and that one is john s mccain !
you know john and you know that he understands that it should n't take a natural disaster like hurricane gustav to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together to get things done .
the convention got under way properly on tuesday it should n't take a natural disaster to teach us that the american people do n't care much if you have an " r " or a " d " after your name .
what they care about is , are we solving the problems they are up against every day ?
let me tell you , what you can expect from john mccain as president is precisely what he has done this week : put our country first .
that is the code by which he has lived his entire life , and that is the code he will carry with him into the white house next january .
i have personally seen john , over and over again , bring people together from both parties to tackle our toughest problems - for example , to reform our campaign finance , lobbying and ethics laws , to create the 9/11 commission and pass the national security reforms , and to end the partisan paralysis over judicial confirmations .
this is the record .
now let me share something with you that i 'm in a unique position to share as a democrat .
my democratic friends know all about john 's record of independence and accomplishment .
maybe that 's why some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince voters that john mccain is someone else .
i 'm here to tell you what i think you know , as a democrat myself , to tell you : do n't be fooled .
god only made one john mccain , and he is his own man .
if john mccain was just another go-along partisan politician , he never would have taken on corrupt republican lobbyists , or big corporations that were cheating the american people , or powerful colleagues in congress who were wasting taxpayer money .
but he did !
if john mccain was just another go-along partisan politician , he never would have led the fight to fix our broken immigration system or to do something about global warming .
but he did !
as a matter of fact , friends , if john mccain is just another partisan republican , then i 'm michael moore 's favorite democrat .
and i 'm not .
change senator barack obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead .
but eloquence is no substitute for a record - not in these tough times for america .
in the senate during the three and a half years that senator obama has been a member , he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done , nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the democratic party to get something done .
contrast that to john mccain 's record , or the record of the last democratic president , bill clinton , who stood up to some of those same democratic interest groups and worked with republicans to get important things done like welfare reform , free trade agreements , and a balanced budget .
i 'm honored to say just a word about the great lady that john mccain has selected as his running mate .
governor palin , like john mccain , is a reformer who has taken on the special interests and power brokers in alaska and reached across party lines .
she is a leader we can count on to help john shake up washington .
that 's why i sincerely believe that the mccain-palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year .
joe lieberman : praise for mccain , criticism of obama the washington bureaucrats and the power brokers are not going to be able to build a pen strong enough to hold these two mavericks .
it 's just not possible .
and together , you can count on john mccain and sarah palin to fight for america and to fight for you !
and that 's what our country needs most right now .
what we need most is not more party unity in america but more national unity !
especially at a time of war , we need a president we can count on to fight for what 's right for our country - not only when it is easy , but when it is hard .
i was there , so i can tell you , when others were silent , john mccain had the guts and the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in iraq .
when others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle , which would have been a disaster for the usa , when colleagues like barack obama were voting to cut off funding for our troops on the battlefield , john mccain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge , and because of that , today , america 's troops are at last beginning to come home , thousands of them , and they 're coming home in honor !
john mccain will be a president that our allies will trust and our enemies will fear , and that 's the kind of president we need here in america .
no ordinary election before i conclude , i ask the indulgence of all of you in this hall tonight , as i want to speak directly to my fellow democrats and independents who are watching or listening tonight .
i know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics and for good reason .
you may be thinking of voting for john mccain but you 're not sure .
some of you have never voted for a republican before and frankly in an ordinary election , you probably would n't .
but i want you to believe with me that this is no ordinary election , because these are not ordinary times , and john mccain is no ordinary candidate .
you may not agree with john mccain on every issue .
but you can always count on him to be straight with you about where he stands , and to stand for what he thinks is right for our country regardless of politics .
as president , you can count on john mccain to be what he is naturally , a restless reformer , who will clean up washington and get our government working again for all of the american people !
so tonight , i ask you whether you are an independent , a reagan democrat or a clinton democrat , or just a democrat : this year , when you vote for president , vote for the person you believe is best for the country , not for the party you happen to belong to .
vote for the leader who , since the age of 17 , when he raised his hand and took an oath to defend and protect our constitution , has always put our country first .
republicans and democrats , let 's come together to make a great american patriot , john mccain , our next great president !

senator lieberman on why he backs john mccain senator joe lieberman , the democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2000 but now an independent , has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota .
here is the text of his speech : thank you so very much for that warm welcome .
i am really honoured to be here .
as you well know , we meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that has hit the gulf coast but that hurts all of us , because we are all members of our larger american family .
at times like this , we set aside all that divides us , and we come together to help our fellow americans in need .
what matters is certainly not whether we are democrats or republicans , but that we are all americans .
the truth is , it should n't take a hurricane to bring us together like this .
every day , across our country , millions of our fellow citizens are facing huge problems .
they are worried about their homes , their jobs , and their businesses ; they are worried about the outrageous cost of gas and of health insurance ; and they are worried about the threats from our enemies abroad .
but when they look to washington , all too often they do not see their leaders coming together to tackle these problems .
instead they see democrats and republicans fighting each other , rather than fighting for the american people .
our founding fathers foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship .
in fact , george washington himself - in his farewell address to our country - warned that the " spirit of party " is " the worst enemy " of our democracy and " enfeebles " our government 's ability to do its job .
the president washington was absolutely right .
the truth is - today we are living through his worst nightmare , in the capital city that bears his name .
and that brings me directly to why i am here tonight .
what , after all , is a democrat like me doing at a republican convention like this ?
i 'll tell you what .
i 'm here to support john mccain because country matters more than party .
i 'm here tonight for a simple reason .
john mccain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward .
i 'm here tonight because john mccain 's whole life testifies to a great truth : being a democrat or a republican is important .
but it is nowhere near as important as being an american .
partisan paralysis i think you know that both presidential candidates this year talk about changing the culture of washington , about breaking through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics .
but only one of them has actually done it .
only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people .
and that one is john s mccain !
you know john and you know that he understands that it should n't take a natural disaster like hurricane gustav to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together to get things done .
the convention got under way properly on tuesday it should n't take a natural disaster to teach us that the american people do n't care much if you have an " r " or a " d " after your name .
what they care about is , are we solving the problems they are up against every day ?
let me tell you , what you can expect from john mccain as president is precisely what he has done this week : put our country first .
that is the code by which he has lived his entire life , and that is the code he will carry with him into the white house next january .
i have personally seen john , over and over again , bring people together from both parties to tackle our toughest problems - for example , to reform our campaign finance , lobbying and ethics laws , to create the 9/11 commission and pass the national security reforms , and to end the partisan paralysis over judicial confirmations .
this is the record .
now let me share something with you that i 'm in a unique position to share as a democrat .
my democratic friends know all about john 's record of independence and accomplishment .
maybe that 's why some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince voters that john mccain is someone else .
i 'm here to tell you what i think you know , as a democrat myself , to tell you : do n't be fooled .
god only made one john mccain , and he is his own man .
if john mccain was just another go-along partisan politician , he never would have taken on corrupt republican lobbyists , or big corporations that were cheating the american people , or powerful colleagues in congress who were wasting taxpayer money .
but he did !
if john mccain was just another go-along partisan politician , he never would have led the fight to fix our broken immigration system or to do something about global warming .
but he did !
as a matter of fact , friends , if john mccain is just another partisan republican , then i 'm michael moore 's favorite democrat .
and i 'm not .
change senator barack obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead .
but eloquence is no substitute for a record - not in these tough times for america .
in the senate during the three and a half years that senator obama has been a member , he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done , nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the democratic party to get something done .
contrast that to john mccain 's record , or the record of the last democratic president , bill clinton , who stood up to some of those same democratic interest groups and worked with republicans to get important things done like welfare reform , free trade agreements , and a balanced budget .
i 'm honored to say just a word about the great lady that john mccain has selected as his running mate .
governor palin , like john mccain , is a reformer who has taken on the special interests and power brokers in alaska and reached across party lines .
she is a leader we can count on to help john shake up washington .
that 's why i sincerely believe that the mccain-palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year .
joe lieberman : praise for mccain , criticism of obama the washington bureaucrats and the power brokers are not going to be able to build a pen strong enough to hold these two mavericks .
it 's just not possible .
and together , you can count on john mccain and sarah palin to fight for america and to fight for you !
and that 's what our country needs most right now .
what we need most is not more party unity in america but more national unity !
especially at a time of war , we need a president we can count on to fight for what 's right for our country - not only when it is easy , but when it is hard .
i was there , so i can tell you , when others were silent , john mccain had the guts and the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in iraq .
when others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle , which would have been a disaster for the usa , when colleagues like barack obama were voting to cut off funding for our troops on the battlefield , john mccain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge , and because of that , today , america 's troops are at last beginning to come home , thousands of them , and they 're coming home in honor !
john mccain will be a president that our allies will trust and our enemies will fear , and that 's the kind of president we need here in america .
no ordinary election before i conclude , i ask the indulgence of all of you in this hall tonight , as i want to speak directly to my fellow democrats and independents who are watching or listening tonight .
i know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics and for good reason .
you may be thinking of voting for john mccain but you 're not sure .
some of you have never voted for a republican before and frankly in an ordinary election , you probably would n't .

only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people .
and that one is john s mccain !
you know john and you know that he understands that it should n't take a natural disaster like hurricane gustav to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together to get things done .
the convention got under way properly on tuesday it should n't take a natural disaster to teach us that the american people do n't care much if you have an " r " or a " d " after your name .
what they care about is , are we solving the problems they are up against every day ?
let me tell you , what you can expect from john mccain as president is precisely what he has done this week : put our country first .
that is the code by which he has lived his entire life , and that is the code he will carry with him into the white house next january .
i have personally seen john , over and over again , bring people together from both parties to tackle our toughest problems - for example , to reform our campaign finance , lobbying and ethics laws , to create the 9/11 commission and pass the national security reforms , and to end the partisan paralysis over judicial confirmations .
this is the record .
now let me share something with you that i 'm in a unique position to share as a democrat .
my democratic friends know all about john 's record of independence and accomplishment .
maybe that 's why some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince voters that john mccain is someone else .
i 'm here to tell you what i think you know , as a democrat myself , to tell you : do n't be fooled .
god only made one john mccain , and he is his own man .
if john mccain was just another go-along partisan politician , he never would have taken on corrupt republican lobbyists , or big corporations that were cheating the american people , or powerful colleagues in congress who were wasting taxpayer money .
but he did !
if john mccain was just another go-along partisan politician , he never would have led the fight to fix our broken immigration system or to do something about global warming .
but he did !
as a matter of fact , friends , if john mccain is just another partisan republican , then i 'm michael moore 's favorite democrat .
and i 'm not .
change senator barack obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead .
but eloquence is no substitute for a record - not in these tough times for america .
in the senate during the three and a half years that senator obama has been a member , he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done , nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the democratic party to get something done .
contrast that to john mccain 's record , or the record of the last democratic president , bill clinton , who stood up to some of those same democratic interest groups and worked with republicans to get important things done like welfare reform , free trade agreements , and a balanced budget .
i 'm honored to say just a word about the great lady that john mccain has selected as his running mate .
governor palin , like john mccain , is a reformer who has taken on the special interests and power brokers in alaska and reached across party lines .
she is a leader we can count on to help john shake up washington .
that 's why i sincerely believe that the mccain-palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year .
joe lieberman : praise for mccain , criticism of obama the washington bureaucrats and the power brokers are not going to be able to build a pen strong enough to hold these two mavericks .
it 's just not possible .
and together , you can count on john mccain and sarah palin to fight for america and to fight for you !
and that 's what our country needs most right now .
what we need most is not more party unity in america but more national unity !
especially at a time of war , we need a president we can count on to fight for what 's right for our country - not only when it is easy , but when it is hard .
i was there , so i can tell you , when others were silent , john mccain had the guts and the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in iraq .
when others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle , which would have been a disaster for the usa , when colleagues like barack obama were voting to cut off funding for our troops on the battlefield , john mccain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge , and because of that , today , america 's troops are at last beginning to come home , thousands of them , and they 're coming home in honor !
john mccain will be a president that our allies will trust and our enemies will fear , and that 's the kind of president we need here in america .
no ordinary election before i conclude , i ask the indulgence of all of you in this hall tonight , as i want to speak directly to my fellow democrats and independents who are watching or listening tonight .
i know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics and for good reason .
you may be thinking of voting for john mccain but you 're not sure .
some of you have never voted for a republican before and frankly in an ordinary election , you probably would n't .
but i want you to believe with me that this is no ordinary election , because these are not ordinary times , and john mccain is no ordinary candidate .
you may not agree with john mccain on every issue .
but you can always count on him to be straight with you about where he stands , and to stand for what he thinks is right for our country regardless of politics .
as president , you can count on john mccain to be what he is naturally , a restless reformer , who will clean up washington and get our government working again for all of the american people !
so tonight , i ask you whether you are an independent , a reagan democrat or a clinton democrat , or just a democrat : this year , when you vote for president , vote for the person you believe is best for the country , not for the party you happen to belong to .
vote for the leader who , since the age of 17 , when he raised his hand and took an oath to defend and protect our constitution , has always put our country first .
republicans and democrats , let 's come together to make a great american patriot , john mccain , our next great president !

senator lieberman on why he backs john mccain senator joe lieberman , the democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2000 but now an independent , has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota .
here is the text of his speech : thank you so very much for that warm welcome .
i am really honoured to be here .
as you well know , we meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that has hit the gulf coast but that hurts all of us , because we are all members of our larger american family .
at times like this , we set aside all that divides us , and we come together to help our fellow americans in need .
what matters is certainly not whether we are democrats or republicans , but that we are all americans .
the truth is , it should n't take a hurricane to bring us together like this .
every day , across our country , millions of our fellow citizens are facing huge problems .
they are worried about their homes , their jobs , and their businesses ; they are worried about the outrageous cost of gas and of health insurance ; and they are worried about the threats from our enemies abroad .
but when they look to washington , all too often they do not see their leaders coming together to tackle these problems .
instead they see democrats and republicans fighting each other , rather than fighting for the american people .
our founding fathers foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship .
in fact , george washington himself - in his farewell address to our country - warned that the " spirit of party " is " the worst enemy " of our democracy and " enfeebles " our government 's ability to do its job .
the president washington was absolutely right .
the truth is - today we are living through his worst nightmare , in the capital city that bears his name .
and that brings me directly to why i am here tonight .
what , after all , is a democrat like me doing at a republican convention like this ?
i 'll tell you what .
i 'm here to support john mccain because country matters more than party .
i 'm here tonight for a simple reason .
john mccain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward .
i 'm here tonight because john mccain 's whole life testifies to a great truth : being a democrat or a republican is important .
but it is nowhere near as important as being an american .
partisan paralysis i think you know that both presidential candidates this year talk about changing the culture of washington , about breaking through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics .
but only one of them has actually done it .
only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people .

manila would instead shift towards direct dialogue with local communities in a bid to end the violence , a presidential official said .
the move follows recent lethal clashes in the southern island of mindanao .
dozens of civilians have been killed in fighting which erupted after the supreme court blocked a controversial autonomy deal with the rebels .
the government had hoped that the deal - to expand an existing muslim autonomous zone - would help end four decades of violence in the region .

and it works both ways - the women in the proceedings b study also resembled their partner 's mother .
the latest work from the university of pécs in hungary provides yet more evidence for the phenomenon , known as sexual imprinting .
others have shown women use dads as a template for picking a mate even if they are adopted , suggesting imprinting is led by experience not simply genes .
this notion is backed by other work showing the imprinting link is lost on women who did not have good relationships with their fathers .
the hungarian team measured the facial proportions of the members of 52 families .
they found significant correlations between the young men and their fathers-in-law , especially on facial proportions belonging to the central area of face - nose and eyes .
women also showed resemblance to their mothers-in-law in the facial characteristics of their lower face - lips and jaw .
lead researcher tamas bereczkei said : " our results support the sexual imprinting hypothesis which states that children shape a mental template of their opposite-sex parents and search for a partner who resembles that perceptual schema . "
familiarity alone does not appear to account for choosing a partner because the participants did not adopt templates for their same-sex parents , they said .
they say males and females choose different facial areas of parents to be models in accordance with their general sexual preferences for facial traits .
have your say " does nobody else think it 's a little bit weird to pick a partner because he looks like your dad ? "
morris , wrexham send us your comments experts say there may be an advantage to selecting a mate somewhat similar to themselves genetically .
dr lynda boothroyd from the university of durham , a psychologist who has carried out similar research , said : " there is an argument that a certain degree of similarity makes people more fertile and genetically compatible . "
but there is a balance between the benefits of marrying someone genetically close and the risks of inbreeding .
" we have a lot of mechanisms - such as pheromones and smell - to stop us choosing someone too similar to us , like an immediate family member , " said dr boothroyd .

the british actress , who plays one of diana 's real-life ancestors in her latest film , the duchess , is adamant the movie recalls the historical journey of that character - and no one else .
" i was very much making a film about georgiana duchess of devonshire and i think that she was an interesting enough person to warrant a film completely about her without comparisons , " she scolds .
at recent previews and press junkets , word spread that it was unwise to ask knightley about the parallels between the two late royals .
but it became an inevitable question - especially as the tagline for the movie is : " there were three people in her marriage " .
' marketing device ' it 's a play on the words famously uttered by diana herself in a frank 1995 tv interview .
and it 's a line the film 's director , saul dibb , admits was carefully selected to attract audiences .
" the reality of it is there 's the film-makers , which is all of us making the film , and then there 's the marketing of the film afterwards .
and they 're two different things , " he says .
" what they 've done is make explicit what would have been written about by everybody anyway .
" it does n't represent us and our approach to the film .
if it gets more people in to see the film , which stands on its own , then perhaps they 're right .
it 's just a marketing device . "
he thinks comparisons could be drawn with " any number of particularly tragic female figures " using marilyn monroe as an example .
dibb adds that critics and fans alike will only think of diana purely because of the " ancestral link " .
maybe he missed the lingering shots of diana in the trailer .
unhappy in fact , it seems hard to believe that anyone will watch this film without making the connection between its heroine 's loveless marriage and the late princess , who said she shared prince charles with camilla parker-bowles throughout her 15-year marriage . "
it was a wonderful challenge and it was completely terrifying " keira knightley but knightley claims not to remember the controversial , and very public , royal relationship .
" i was 11 when diana died so i really do n't know what the actual story is , so i do n't feel i can comment on the parallels , " she tells a journalist who , bravely , raises the topic at a press conference .
" i knew when i was going into it -lsb- the film -rsb- that she was a distant relation but that is as far as my knowledge goes , " knightley says .
the film tells the story of georgiana , the 18th century aristocrat , who was loved by the public and famed for her fashion .
behind the scenes , she was terribly unhappy , living with her husband -lrb- ralph fiennes -rrb- and his lover -lrb- hayley atwell -rrb- , unable to leave because of the way society viewed divorce .
whether the parallels exist or not , the finished product provides an interesting insight into the life of diana 's great-great-great-great aunt .
' absolutely phenomenal ' it was not an easy project for the actors , as knightley reveals she spent two-and-a-half hours in make up daily and was often sewn into her costumes .
" the costumes were completely fantastic and obviously she was a very famous fashion icon , but they were n't particularly comfortable , " she says .
filming on location at various stately homes proved hard for the production team too .
dibb recalls how staff insisted the actors remained more than 90cm away from the walls .
touching any part of the venue was out of bounds , too .
shooting the wedding scene , which involved hundreds of lit candles , was almost an impossibility - as knightley explains .
" they would n't let the room get too hot , because every time it did we started melting the ceiling above so we all had to shut down and they had to cool down the room . "
despite not seeing the completed film -lrb- she was too embarrassed -rrb- , knightley says she is pleased she accepted the part .
" it was a wonderful challenge and it was completely terrifying , " she says .
" there are fewer really great female roles than there are for actors so when one comes along and you get the opportunity to play it , it is absolutely phenomenal . "

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement keira knightley discusses the duchess by fiona pryor entertainment reporter , bbc news if there is one person keira knightley does not want to be compared to it is diana , princess of wales .
the british actress , who plays one of diana 's real-life ancestors in her latest film , the duchess , is adamant the movie recalls the historical journey of that character - and no one else .
" i was very much making a film about georgiana duchess of devonshire and i think that she was an interesting enough person to warrant a film completely about her without comparisons , " she scolds .
at recent previews and press junkets , word spread that it was unwise to ask knightley about the parallels between the two late royals .
but it became an inevitable question - especially as the tagline for the movie is : " there were three people in her marriage " .
diana said she had " shared " her husband with camilla parker-bowles ' marketing device ' it 's a play on the words famously uttered by diana herself in a frank 1995 tv interview .
and it 's a line the film 's director , saul dibb , admits was carefully selected to attract audiences .
" the reality of it is there 's the film-makers , which is all of us making the film , and then there 's the marketing of the film afterwards .
and they 're two different things , " he says .
" what they 've done is make explicit what would have been written about by everybody anyway .
" it does n't represent us and our approach to the film .
if it gets more people in to see the film , which stands on its own , then perhaps they 're right .
it 's just a marketing device . "
he thinks comparisons could be drawn with " any number of particularly tragic female figures " using marilyn monroe as an example .
dibb adds that critics and fans alike will only think of diana purely because of the " ancestral link " .
maybe he missed the lingering shots of diana in the trailer .
unhappy in fact , it seems hard to believe that anyone will watch this film without making the connection between its heroine 's loveless marriage and the late princess , who said she shared prince charles with camilla parker-bowles throughout her 15-year marriage .
it was a wonderful challenge and it was completely terrifying keira knightley but knightley claims not to remember the controversial , and very public , royal relationship .
" i was 11 when diana died so i really do n't know what the actual story is , so i do n't feel i can comment on the parallels , " she tells a journalist who , bravely , raises the topic at a press conference .
" i knew when i was going into it -lsb- the film -rsb- that she was a distant relation but that is as far as my knowledge goes , " knightley says .
the film tells the story of georgiana , the 18th century aristocrat , who was loved by the public and famed for her fashion .
behind the scenes , she was terribly unhappy , living with her husband -lrb- ralph fiennes -rrb- and his lover -lrb- hayley atwell -rrb- , unable to leave because of the way society viewed divorce .
whether the parallels exist or not , the finished product provides an interesting insight into the life of diana 's great-great-great-great aunt .
' absolutely phenomenal ' it was not an easy project for the actors , as knightley reveals she spent two-and-a-half hours in make up daily and was often sewn into her costumes .
the candle scene caused nightmares for the production team " the costumes were completely fantastic and obviously she was a very famous fashion icon , but they were n't particularly comfortable , " she says .
filming on location at various stately homes proved hard for the production team too .
dibb recalls how staff insisted the actors remained more than 90cm away from the walls .
touching any part of the venue was out of bounds , too .
shooting the wedding scene , which involved hundreds of lit candles , was almost an impossibility - as knightley explains .
" they would n't let the room get too hot , because every time it did we started melting the ceiling above so we all had to shut down and they had to cool down the room . "
despite not seeing the completed film -lrb- she was too embarrassed -rrb- , knightley says she is pleased she accepted the part .
" it was a wonderful challenge and it was completely terrifying , " she says .
" there are fewer really great female roles than there are for actors so when one comes along and you get the opportunity to play it , it is absolutely phenomenal . "

advertisement the company concerned is investigating a phone company has launched an investigation after a " substantial " number of people in exeter received repeated silent late-night phone calls .
some householders said they were " very distressed " after getting as many as seven calls in 12 hours , leading to a disturbed night 's sleep .
british telecom said it had received a number of complaints and had alerted verizon , the company responsible .
verizon said the calls had now stopped and it was " looking into the matter " .
your first thought is maybe it 's one of your family , that there 's something up with them sylvia downing pensioner sylvia downing said that on monday night she had seven silent phone calls in just over 12 hours .
" your first thought is maybe it 's one of your family , that there 's something up with one or other of them .
" that 's what annoys you more than when you go down there and there 's no-one there , " she said .
sylvia 's daughter and granddaughter also had the same phone problem , as did brian snell .
he said he was woken for the first time at 0200 bst " i picked up the phone , nothing .
