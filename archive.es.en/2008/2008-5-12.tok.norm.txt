the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .

the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .
" their goal is to privatize international law-making , " said christine von weizsaecker , president of the environmental institute ecoropa .
planet diversity parallel to the conference , environmental and farmers ' organizations from 90 countries are holding their own alternative gathering called planet diversity .
the bonn conference comes a week before the mammoth convention of the body that implements the un 's convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- .
some 5,000 representatives from 190 countries are participating in the conference , among them german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva .
the agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .
" their goal is to privatize international law-making , " said christine von weizsaecker , president of the environmental institute ecoropa .
planet diversity parallel to the conference , environmental and farmers ' organizations from 90 countries are holding their own alternative gathering called planet diversity .
the bonn conference comes a week before the mammoth convention of the body that implements the un 's convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- .
some 5,000 representatives from 190 countries are participating in the conference , among them german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva .
the agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .
relations have reached a standoff since russia 's subsequent declaration that it would increase peacekeeping troops in the region and was ready to intervene to protect abkhaz citizen 's , most of whom hold russian passports . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the growing economies of the region , with powerhouses like brazil and mexico , had added to its political significance . " as partners for years we have to hurry to remain important partners , " merkel said last week . europe is the greatest investor in latin america , its second most important trading partner and the main donor of development aid . more than 60 countries from europe , south and central america and the caribbean will attend the lima summit , which has as its main themes poverty , inequality , sustainable development and the environment .

after the summit , merkel will travel to colombia .
the last station on the trip is mexico . german government spokesmen pointed to economic growth for the region as a whole last year of some 5.6 percent , with summit hosts peru growing at 9 percent . german government sources indicated that the rise of left-wing nationalism in some countries in the region was cause for concern in berlin , although they did not rule out the possibility that merkel would meet some of the leaders of the countries in question during the summit , according to dpa . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but both countries are struggling to change misperceptions and enhance business relations . michael theis sat down with a group of several dozen german businessmen on wednesday , may 7 to talk about a country they knew little about : israel . many medium-sized german business owners see israel as a conflict zone .
they know it 's famous for growing oranges and that 's where their knowledge ends , theis said . yet theis , a founder of the consulting company isucon partners who became sold on israel during his venture capital days , said the german businessmen at the recent meeting held in the eastern german city of halle became very interested when he started explaining israel 's high tech prowess and demand for quality consumer goods . " they were really excited and wanted to know how they can enter the market , " theis said .
" i told them , if you have high-quality products , then you have a chance in israel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has excelled in biotech misperceptions persist though the german media have pumped up coverage of israel in conjunction with the country 's 60th birthday on thursday , may 8 , there has been scant attention paid to economic issues . israelis accuse germany of being willfully ignorant of the economic transformation which their country has undergone , often preferring to think of israel as an agricultural backwater . " israel is a player in this global world , " former israeli ambassador to germany shimon stein said .
" we are not a country who is looking for charity or a kind of third world country that looks for development aid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's technology sector is thriving nearly 75 percent of israeli exports to germany come in the form of high-tech goods , according to the german-israeli chamber of commerce . yet not all of the blame for misperceptions lies with germany .
israel needs to do a better job of showing that it can provide the quality and innovation that german companies demand , said stein , who founded international consulting after leaving the ambassador post in 2007 . " it is business .
it is not emotions , it is not memories , " stein said .
" what i have always been advocating is that business is a win-win situation .
you come , explore .
if you see that it 's not good for you , go elsewhere . " unequal trade continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's landscape has changed dramatically in the past 60 years germany-israel economic relations started more than a decade before diplomatic relations were established in 1965 when germany began providing reparations , mostly in the form of machinery . over the following decades , germany 's exports to israel have remained fairly constant and include machinery , precision tools , chemical products and consumer goods . the amount of trade between the two countries toped $ 5.4 billion -lrb- 3.5 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 and has had an average yearly growth rate of 9 percent since 1960 , according to the chamber of commerce . while german corporate giants such as siemens , telekom , sap and volkwagen have been investing heavily in israel for years , and in some cases decades , medium-sized german companies are less likely to have business relations with israeli companies . from the other direction , israeli firms have long seen germany as a key trade partner , and it remains second only to the united states .
israeli companies are investing billions in germany 's real estate market . the trade inequality has also remained constant .
germany exports to israel are twice what it imports .
that generally holds true for all of europe , said grisha alroi-arloser , head of the german-israeli chamber -lrb- ahk israel -rrb- . " israel is buying in europe and selling in the us , " alroi said . business not on political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is a leader in solar technology alroi would like to see germany increase its direct investment to israel and for israeli products to have a stronger presence in the german market .
ideally , the trade amounts between the two countries would be more balanced , alroi said . however , vardina hilloo , a dusseldorf-based business journalist who grew up in israel , is somewhat more pessimistic about the desire from both sides to improve on the status quo .
hilloo started the online magazine israfocus three years ago which aims to educate the german and european business community about israeli business and economic topics . from the german side , hilloo sees not only a troubling level of ignorance among german businessmen but also a disinterest among german politicians . she pointed to the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers .
the christian democrat plans to travel to the region for the fourth time on may 31 .
yet hilloo said she was discouraged to hear that the state leader does not have any major economic initiatives on his agenda . " it 's quite frustrating , " hilloo said . boycotts lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german businessmen see israel foremost as a conflict zone in the decades after world war ii boycotts against german products were common and there are still israelis who would never buy a volkswagen as the company is tied in some memories to nazi atrocities against jews . for years , the israeli government avoided the controversy by buying volvos .
yet in 2007 the israeli government raised eyebrows by announced it had awarded a government contract to audi and skoda , both owned by volkswagen .
the decision drew calls for a boycott from the religious party shas . " private people are entitled to drive any car they choose to , but we -lsb- the government -rsb- should be careful about the message we give to the public , " shas minister yitzhak cohen said in a letter to prime minister ehud olmert . yet boycotts are the exception , not the rule , experts say .
for the most part , german consumer goods enjoy the same reputation they do in most countries . most israelis have no problem buying a german car or washing machine , if they can afford the high price tags , alroi said , adding that many german products were available in israeli stores . former ambassador stein agreed that boycotts are mainly a thing of the past . " you will always find israelis who will boycott german goods .
but that is rather a negligible minority , " stein said . different ways of doing business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sap has bought israeli startups theis , of isucon partners , said in his seven years of doing business with israeli companies , the holocaust comes up as a topic , but he has never experienced bitterness or felt it was a barrier . but plenty of cultural gaps exist , theis added .
isucon partners mainly helping israeli companies who want to open a subsidiary or are looking for partners in europe , acting as a sort of matchmaker and cultural go-between . theis often finds himself coaching israeli businessmen on the german style of business .
israelis will tend to call on friday to try and set up a meeting for monday , something which throws german partners who " are not that flexible , " theis said .
german managers are also used to entering meetings with figures and presentations while israelis tend to be more spontaneous . " i have to tell my clients , ' please prepare a small 10-page presentation and bring products with you , " ' theis said . yet he sees a willingness from both sides to improve business relations .
in 2007 , theis organized a delegation of 30 people from leipzig to travel to israel .
it was a mix of politicians , businessmen and the odd filmmaker .
the trip generated contacts and excitement and a follow-up trip is planned for october . theis said he is continuously surprised at how eager everyone he meets is to get down to business . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.05.2008 eu reaffirms support for georgia in spat with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgians do n't want russia to meddle in their affairs eu ministers in tbilisi reaffirmed their backing of georgia 's " territorial integrity " amid fears that growing hostilities with russian-backed separatists regions could lead to open conflict . " the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .

survivors still waiting for relief tuesday 's meeting of eu development ministers comes amid a deteriorating situation in the asian country .
cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .
the military government 's refusal to fully open its doors has infuriated aid groups and foreign governments who say that unless they have free access , the toll from the disaster will rise dramatically as hunger and disease set in .
according to some estimates , around 1.5 million survivors are still waiting for assistance .
on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.05.2008 chavez hits out at merkel ahead of eu-latin america summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez unleashed his insults during his weekly broadcast " alo presidente " venezuelan president hugo chavez verbally attacked german chancellor angela merkel in his sunday radio and television show , comparing her policies to those of adolf hitler . during his broadcast , the venezuelan leader criticized merkel for belonging to the conservative christian democratic union , calling her party " the same right wing that supported hitler and fascism . "
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .
merkel sets off on her first latin american tour on tuesday .

" the citizens of serbia have undoubtedly confirmed a clear european path , " president boris tadic , the flag-bearer of the pro-european forces , told jubilant supporters overnight .
" it is necessary to form a government as soon as possible , " tadic said in his ds campaign headquarters .
serbians celebrate in the streets the results sparked fireworks and celebrations on the streets of belgrade , where cars draped in serbian , ds and eu flags honked their horns as they drove around the city centre .
if confirmed , the election results will be seen as a breakthrough for serbia , which has struggled for political unity on the goal of eventual eu membership since late dictator slobodan milosevic was ousted eight years ago .
" i think that the european future of serbia is guaranteed , " said zoran lucic of the non-governmental centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , whose latest estimates gave the ds coalition 38.7 percent versus 29.1 percent for the radicals .
eu presidency hails victory the eu 's slovenian presidency hailed what it called " a clear victory " by pro-european forces , adding it hoped a new government would soon be formed " with a clear european agenda . "

" the citizens of serbia have undoubtedly confirmed a clear european path , " president boris tadic , the flag-bearer of the pro-european forces , told jubilant supporters overnight .
" it is necessary to form a government as soon as possible , " tadic said in his ds campaign headquarters .
serbians celebrate in the streets the results sparked fireworks and celebrations on the streets of belgrade , where cars draped in serbian , ds and eu flags honked their horns as they drove around the city centre .
if confirmed , the election results will be seen as a breakthrough for serbia , which has struggled for political unity on the goal of eventual eu membership since late dictator slobodan milosevic was ousted eight years ago .
" i think that the european future of serbia is guaranteed , " said zoran lucic of the non-governmental centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , whose latest estimates gave the ds coalition 38.7 percent versus 29.1 percent for the radicals .
eu presidency hails victory the eu 's slovenian presidency hailed what it called " a clear victory " by pro-european forces , adding it hoped a new government would soon be formed " with a clear european agenda . "
tadic 's democrats will now need to form a coalition with at least one other party - the socialists , founded by milosevic , or the liberal democrats , whose leader cedomir jovanovic negotiated the late dictator 's arrest in 2001 .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .

the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .

cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .

on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .

a red cross spokesman said that nine of its planes will have reached the former burmese capital of rangoon by day 's end .

" the purpose of the meeting will be to review the situation and to beef up the response of the eu member states and the european commission to this emergency situation , " a statement from the commission said .

survivors still waiting for relief tuesday 's meeting of eu development ministers comes amid a deteriorating situation in the asian country .
cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .

according to some estimates , around 1.5 million survivors are still waiting for assistance .
on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .
ruling generals reiterated on monday that foreign aid experts would not be put in charge of themission .
delivery of relief goods can be handled by local organizations , " said economic development minister soe tha , quoted by the new light of myanmar newspaper - the junta 's state-run mouthpiece .

other international aid flights have been increasing .
a red cross spokesman said that nine of its planes will have reached the former burmese capital of rangoon by day 's end .

some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .

" the purpose of the meeting will be to review the situation and to beef up the response of the eu member states and the european commission to this emergency situation , " a statement from the commission said .
" the commission and the eu ministers will also try to identify and co-ordinate the best means of facilitating the mobilization and delivery of international humanitarian assistance . "

" it is our sincere wish to work in close co-operation with the burmese authorities to urgently alleviate the suffering of the burmese people affected by the cyclone , " michel said .
survivors still waiting for relief tuesday 's meeting of eu development ministers comes amid a deteriorating situation in the asian country .
cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .
the military government 's refusal to fully open its doors has infuriated aid groups and foreign governments who say that unless they have free access , the toll from the disaster will rise dramatically as hunger and disease set in .
according to some estimates , around 1.5 million survivors are still waiting for assistance .
on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .
ruling generals reiterated on monday that foreign aid experts would not be put in charge of themission .
delivery of relief goods can be handled by local organizations , " said economic development minister soe tha , quoted by the new light of myanmar newspaper - the junta 's state-run mouthpiece .
aid experts frustrated by resistance aid groups have insisted the regime does not have the capacity to direct the relief operation in the delta , where diarrhea and other illnesses are starting to threaten survivors living in desperate conditions .
other international aid flights have been increasing .
a red cross spokesman said that nine of its planes will have reached the former burmese capital of rangoon by day 's end .
but aid groups stress that far more is needed .

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .
" their goal is to privatize international law-making , " said christine von weizsaecker , president of the environmental institute ecoropa .
planet diversity parallel to the conference , environmental and farmers ' organizations from 90 countries are holding their own alternative gathering called planet diversity .
the bonn conference comes a week before the mammoth convention of the body that implements the un 's convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- .
some 5,000 representatives from 190 countries are participating in the conference , among them german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva .

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .
" their goal is to privatize international law-making , " said christine von weizsaecker , president of the environmental institute ecoropa .
planet diversity parallel to the conference , environmental and farmers ' organizations from 90 countries are holding their own alternative gathering called planet diversity .
the bonn conference comes a week before the mammoth convention of the body that implements the un 's convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- .
some 5,000 representatives from 190 countries are participating in the conference , among them german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva .

"
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .
merkel sets off on her first latin american tour on tuesday .

" the purpose of the meeting will be to review the situation and to beef up the response of the eu member states and the european commission to this emergency situation , " a statement from the commission said .
" the commission and the eu ministers will also try to identify and co-ordinate the best means of facilitating the mobilization and delivery of international humanitarian assistance . "

" it is our sincere wish to work in close co-operation with the burmese authorities to urgently alleviate the suffering of the burmese people affected by the cyclone , " michel said .
survivors still waiting for relief tuesday 's meeting of eu development ministers comes amid a deteriorating situation in the asian country .
cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .
the military government 's refusal to fully open its doors has infuriated aid groups and foreign governments who say that unless they have free access , the toll from the disaster will rise dramatically as hunger and disease set in .
according to some estimates , around 1.5 million survivors are still waiting for assistance .
on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .
ruling generals reiterated on monday that foreign aid experts would not be put in charge of themission .
delivery of relief goods can be handled by local organizations , " said economic development minister soe tha , quoted by the new light of myanmar newspaper - the junta 's state-run mouthpiece .
aid experts frustrated by resistance aid groups have insisted the regime does not have the capacity to direct the relief operation in the delta , where diarrhea and other illnesses are starting to threaten survivors living in desperate conditions .
other international aid flights have been increasing .
a red cross spokesman said that nine of its planes will have reached the former burmese capital of rangoon by day 's end .
but aid groups stress that far more is needed .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .
relations have reached a standoff since russia 's subsequent declaration that it would increase peacekeeping troops in the region and was ready to intervene to protect abkhaz citizen 's , most of whom hold russian passports . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .

the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "

" it is our sincere wish to work in close co-operation with the burmese authorities to urgently alleviate the suffering of the burmese people affected by the cyclone , " michel said .
survivors still waiting for relief tuesday 's meeting of eu development ministers comes amid a deteriorating situation in the asian country .
cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .
the military government 's refusal to fully open its doors has infuriated aid groups and foreign governments who say that unless they have free access , the toll from the disaster will rise dramatically as hunger and disease set in .
according to some estimates , around 1.5 million survivors are still waiting for assistance .
on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .
ruling generals reiterated on monday that foreign aid experts would not be put in charge of themission .
delivery of relief goods can be handled by local organizations , " said economic development minister soe tha , quoted by the new light of myanmar newspaper - the junta 's state-run mouthpiece .
aid experts frustrated by resistance aid groups have insisted the regime does not have the capacity to direct the relief operation in the delta , where diarrhea and other illnesses are starting to threaten survivors living in desperate conditions .
other international aid flights have been increasing .
a red cross spokesman said that nine of its planes will have reached the former burmese capital of rangoon by day 's end .

"
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .

but both countries are struggling to change misperceptions and enhance business relations . michael theis sat down with a group of several dozen german businessmen on wednesday , may 7 to talk about a country they knew little about : israel . many medium-sized german business owners see israel as a conflict zone .
they know it 's famous for growing oranges and that 's where their knowledge ends , theis said . yet theis , a founder of the consulting company isucon partners who became sold on israel during his venture capital days , said the german businessmen at the recent meeting held in the eastern german city of halle became very interested when he started explaining israel 's high tech prowess and demand for quality consumer goods . " they were really excited and wanted to know how they can enter the market , " theis said .
" i told them , if you have high-quality products , then you have a chance in israel .

" israel is a player in this global world , " former israeli ambassador to germany shimon stein said .
" we are not a country who is looking for charity or a kind of third world country that looks for development aid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's technology sector is thriving nearly 75 percent of israeli exports to germany come in the form of high-tech goods , according to the german-israeli chamber of commerce . yet not all of the blame for misperceptions lies with germany .
israel needs to do a better job of showing that it can provide the quality and innovation that german companies demand , said stein , who founded international consulting after leaving the ambassador post in 2007 . " it is business .

israeli companies are investing billions in germany 's real estate market . the trade inequality has also remained constant .
germany exports to israel are twice what it imports .

ideally , the trade amounts between the two countries would be more balanced , alroi said . however , vardina hilloo , a dusseldorf-based business journalist who grew up in israel , is somewhat more pessimistic about the desire from both sides to improve on the status quo .
hilloo started the online magazine israfocus three years ago which aims to educate the german and european business community about israeli business and economic topics . from the german side , hilloo sees not only a troubling level of ignorance among german businessmen but also a disinterest among german politicians . she pointed to the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers .

"
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .
merkel sets off on her first latin american tour on tuesday .

survivors still waiting for relief tuesday 's meeting of eu development ministers comes amid a deteriorating situation in the asian country .
cyclone nargis , which smashed into the rice-growing irrawaddy delta region in the country 's south on may 3 , has left nearly 62,000 people dead or missing , according to a government toll .
the military government 's refusal to fully open its doors has infuriated aid groups and foreign governments who say that unless they have free access , the toll from the disaster will rise dramatically as hunger and disease set in .
according to some estimates , around 1.5 million survivors are still waiting for assistance .
on monday , the united states sent its first aid flight to burma , but the government 's resistance to outside expertise will likely result in slow , inefficient aid distribution .
ruling generals reiterated on monday that foreign aid experts would not be put in charge of themission .
delivery of relief goods can be handled by local organizations , " said economic development minister soe tha , quoted by the new light of myanmar newspaper - the junta 's state-run mouthpiece .
aid experts frustrated by resistance aid groups have insisted the regime does not have the capacity to direct the relief operation in the delta , where diarrhea and other illnesses are starting to threaten survivors living in desperate conditions .

but both countries are struggling to change misperceptions and enhance business relations . michael theis sat down with a group of several dozen german businessmen on wednesday , may 7 to talk about a country they knew little about : israel . many medium-sized german business owners see israel as a conflict zone .
they know it 's famous for growing oranges and that 's where their knowledge ends , theis said . yet theis , a founder of the consulting company isucon partners who became sold on israel during his venture capital days , said the german businessmen at the recent meeting held in the eastern german city of halle became very interested when he started explaining israel 's high tech prowess and demand for quality consumer goods . " they were really excited and wanted to know how they can enter the market , " theis said .
" i told them , if you have high-quality products , then you have a chance in israel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has excelled in biotech misperceptions persist though the german media have pumped up coverage of israel in conjunction with the country 's 60th birthday on thursday , may 8 , there has been scant attention paid to economic issues . israelis accuse germany of being willfully ignorant of the economic transformation which their country has undergone , often preferring to think of israel as an agricultural backwater . " israel is a player in this global world , " former israeli ambassador to germany shimon stein said .
" we are not a country who is looking for charity or a kind of third world country that looks for development aid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's technology sector is thriving nearly 75 percent of israeli exports to germany come in the form of high-tech goods , according to the german-israeli chamber of commerce . yet not all of the blame for misperceptions lies with germany .
israel needs to do a better job of showing that it can provide the quality and innovation that german companies demand , said stein , who founded international consulting after leaving the ambassador post in 2007 . " it is business .
it is not emotions , it is not memories , " stein said .
" what i have always been advocating is that business is a win-win situation .
you come , explore .
if you see that it 's not good for you , go elsewhere . " unequal trade continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's landscape has changed dramatically in the past 60 years germany-israel economic relations started more than a decade before diplomatic relations were established in 1965 when germany began providing reparations , mostly in the form of machinery . over the following decades , germany 's exports to israel have remained fairly constant and include machinery , precision tools , chemical products and consumer goods . the amount of trade between the two countries toped $ 5.4 billion -lrb- 3.5 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 and has had an average yearly growth rate of 9 percent since 1960 , according to the chamber of commerce . while german corporate giants such as siemens , telekom , sap and volkwagen have been investing heavily in israel for years , and in some cases decades , medium-sized german companies are less likely to have business relations with israeli companies . from the other direction , israeli firms have long seen germany as a key trade partner , and it remains second only to the united states .
israeli companies are investing billions in germany 's real estate market . the trade inequality has also remained constant .
germany exports to israel are twice what it imports .
that generally holds true for all of europe , said grisha alroi-arloser , head of the german-israeli chamber -lrb- ahk israel -rrb- . " israel is buying in europe and selling in the us , " alroi said . business not on political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is a leader in solar technology alroi would like to see germany increase its direct investment to israel and for israeli products to have a stronger presence in the german market .
ideally , the trade amounts between the two countries would be more balanced , alroi said . however , vardina hilloo , a dusseldorf-based business journalist who grew up in israel , is somewhat more pessimistic about the desire from both sides to improve on the status quo .
hilloo started the online magazine israfocus three years ago which aims to educate the german and european business community about israeli business and economic topics . from the german side , hilloo sees not only a troubling level of ignorance among german businessmen but also a disinterest among german politicians . she pointed to the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers .
the christian democrat plans to travel to the region for the fourth time on may 31 .
yet hilloo said she was discouraged to hear that the state leader does not have any major economic initiatives on his agenda . " it 's quite frustrating , " hilloo said . boycotts lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german businessmen see israel foremost as a conflict zone in the decades after world war ii boycotts against german products were common and there are still israelis who would never buy a volkswagen as the company is tied in some memories to nazi atrocities against jews . for years , the israeli government avoided the controversy by buying volvos .
yet in 2007 the israeli government raised eyebrows by announced it had awarded a government contract to audi and skoda , both owned by volkswagen .
the decision drew calls for a boycott from the religious party shas . " private people are entitled to drive any car they choose to , but we -lsb- the government -rsb- should be careful about the message we give to the public , " shas minister yitzhak cohen said in a letter to prime minister ehud olmert . yet boycotts are the exception , not the rule , experts say .
for the most part , german consumer goods enjoy the same reputation they do in most countries . most israelis have no problem buying a german car or washing machine , if they can afford the high price tags , alroi said , adding that many german products were available in israeli stores . former ambassador stein agreed that boycotts are mainly a thing of the past . " you will always find israelis who will boycott german goods .
but that is rather a negligible minority , " stein said . different ways of doing business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sap has bought israeli startups theis , of isucon partners , said in his seven years of doing business with israeli companies , the holocaust comes up as a topic , but he has never experienced bitterness or felt it was a barrier . but plenty of cultural gaps exist , theis added .
isucon partners mainly helping israeli companies who want to open a subsidiary or are looking for partners in europe , acting as a sort of matchmaker and cultural go-between . theis often finds himself coaching israeli businessmen on the german style of business .
israelis will tend to call on friday to try and set up a meeting for monday , something which throws german partners who " are not that flexible , " theis said .
german managers are also used to entering meetings with figures and presentations while israelis tend to be more spontaneous . " i have to tell my clients , ' please prepare a small 10-page presentation and bring products with you , " ' theis said . yet he sees a willingness from both sides to improve business relations .
in 2007 , theis organized a delegation of 30 people from leipzig to travel to israel .
it was a mix of politicians , businessmen and the odd filmmaker .
the trip generated contacts and excitement and a follow-up trip is planned for october . theis said he is continuously surprised at how eager everyone he meets is to get down to business . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that russia 's actions in the so-called " frozen conflicts " are connected with the security of lithuania and , in turn , the eu , lithuania wanted to add a declaration regarding georgia and moldova in its negotiating mandate .
the mandate will be discussed at a may 26 meeting of the council of foreign ministers from the 27-nation eu , which will have to approve sunday 's deal before lithuania formally lifts its veto .

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .
" their goal is to privatize international law-making , " said christine von weizsaecker , president of the environmental institute ecoropa .
planet diversity parallel to the conference , environmental and farmers ' organizations from 90 countries are holding their own alternative gathering called planet diversity .
the bonn conference comes a week before the mammoth convention of the body that implements the un 's convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- .
some 5,000 representatives from 190 countries are participating in the conference , among them german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva .

the growing economies of the region , with powerhouses like brazil and mexico , had added to its political significance . " as partners for years we have to hurry to remain important partners , " merkel said last week . europe is the greatest investor in latin america , its second most important trading partner and the main donor of development aid . more than 60 countries from europe , south and central america and the caribbean will attend the lima summit , which has as its main themes poverty , inequality , sustainable development and the environment .

after the summit , merkel will travel to colombia .
the last station on the trip is mexico . german government spokesmen pointed to economic growth for the region as a whole last year of some 5.6 percent , with summit hosts peru growing at 9 percent . german government sources indicated that the rise of left-wing nationalism in some countries in the region was cause for concern in berlin , although they did not rule out the possibility that merkel would meet some of the leaders of the countries in question during the summit , according to dpa . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .

" the citizens of serbia have undoubtedly confirmed a clear european path , " president boris tadic , the flag-bearer of the pro-european forces , told jubilant supporters overnight .
" it is necessary to form a government as soon as possible , " tadic said in his ds campaign headquarters .
serbians celebrate in the streets the results sparked fireworks and celebrations on the streets of belgrade , where cars draped in serbian , ds and eu flags honked their horns as they drove around the city centre .
if confirmed , the election results will be seen as a breakthrough for serbia , which has struggled for political unity on the goal of eventual eu membership since late dictator slobodan milosevic was ousted eight years ago .

"
chavez was on the verge of launching further insults , but suddenly stopped short , saying he would spare the chancellor , because she was a lady .
chavez 's remarks came after merkel voiced her own criticism of the south american leader 's policies , in which she said that the left-wing leader was not the voice of the region .
merkel , speaking to the german news agency dpa ahead of the european union-latin american summit , indicated that leftist policies pursued by leaders like chavez were not the answer .
pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .
merkel sets off on her first latin american tour on tuesday .
her agenda includes stops in brazil , peru , colombia and mexico . dw staff / dpa -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that russia 's actions in the so-called " frozen conflicts " are connected with the security of lithuania and , in turn , the eu , lithuania wanted to add a declaration regarding georgia and moldova in its negotiating mandate .
the mandate will be discussed at a may 26 meeting of the council of foreign ministers from the 27-nation eu , which will have to approve sunday 's deal before lithuania formally lifts its veto .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .

" the citizens of serbia have undoubtedly confirmed a clear european path , " president boris tadic , the flag-bearer of the pro-european forces , told jubilant supporters overnight .
" it is necessary to form a government as soon as possible , " tadic said in his ds campaign headquarters .
serbians celebrate in the streets the results sparked fireworks and celebrations on the streets of belgrade , where cars draped in serbian , ds and eu flags honked their horns as they drove around the city centre .
if confirmed , the election results will be seen as a breakthrough for serbia , which has struggled for political unity on the goal of eventual eu membership since late dictator slobodan milosevic was ousted eight years ago .
" i think that the european future of serbia is guaranteed , " said zoran lucic of the non-governmental centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , whose latest estimates gave the ds coalition 38.7 percent versus 29.1 percent for the radicals .
eu presidency hails victory the eu 's slovenian presidency hailed what it called " a clear victory " by pro-european forces , adding it hoped a new government would soon be formed " with a clear european agenda . "
tadic 's democrats will now need to form a coalition with at least one other party - the socialists , founded by milosevic , or the liberal democrats , whose leader cedomir jovanovic negotiated the late dictator 's arrest in 2001 .
" the democratic party will be the key player in the future cabinet , " said tadic .
" the negotiations will not be easy -lrb- but -rrb- i warn everyone not to play with the electoral will of the citizens and try to take serbia back to the isolation of the 1990s , " he said in reference to the milosevic regime . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .
relations have reached a standoff since russia 's subsequent declaration that it would increase peacekeeping troops in the region and was ready to intervene to protect abkhaz citizen 's , most of whom hold russian passports . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pointing to the emergence of " left wing populism " in some of the nations of latin america , merkel said : " based on our experience in europe , i do n't believe that state-guided economies can provide a better or more sustainable response to such pressing problems . "
chavez angry over " empty promises " chavez replied that he would answer merkel at the summit if he chooses to attend .
" many people want you to shut up .
but if i fly to lima and i say something to her and she gets upset , she would then stand up and say ' why do n't you shut up ? " '
chavez opined , referring to a controversial moment last year that set off a diplomatic spat between venezuela and spain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at last year 's iberian american summit , things got ugly between chavez and spanish king juan carlos spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero criticized chavez at the iberian american summit in november for calling his predecessor jose maria aznar a " fascist " who favored the failed coup in venezuela in 2002 , sparking an outburst that ended with spanish king juan carlos shouting , " why do n't you shut up ? " at chavez .
on sunday , chavez said the region could do without empty offers of help from the united states and europe .
the europeans " come here to help us .
where is their plan to help the poor ?
ask the president of haiti how much promises from europe and the united states have done , " chavez said , stressing the region 's social programs would be carried by venezuela , cuba , argentina and brazil .
berlin brushes comments aside the german government brushed off the verbal onslaught , with spokesman thomas steg saying only that merkel was looking forward to participating in the fifth european union-latin american and caribbean summit -lrb- eu-lac -rrb- to be held on friday and saturday in lima .

" the citizens of serbia have undoubtedly confirmed a clear european path , " president boris tadic , the flag-bearer of the pro-european forces , told jubilant supporters overnight .
" it is necessary to form a government as soon as possible , " tadic said in his ds campaign headquarters .
serbians celebrate in the streets the results sparked fireworks and celebrations on the streets of belgrade , where cars draped in serbian , ds and eu flags honked their horns as they drove around the city centre .
if confirmed , the election results will be seen as a breakthrough for serbia , which has struggled for political unity on the goal of eventual eu membership since late dictator slobodan milosevic was ousted eight years ago .
" i think that the european future of serbia is guaranteed , " said zoran lucic of the non-governmental centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , whose latest estimates gave the ds coalition 38.7 percent versus 29.1 percent for the radicals .
eu presidency hails victory the eu 's slovenian presidency hailed what it called " a clear victory " by pro-european forces , adding it hoped a new government would soon be formed " with a clear european agenda . "
tadic 's democrats will now need to form a coalition with at least one other party - the socialists , founded by milosevic , or the liberal democrats , whose leader cedomir jovanovic negotiated the late dictator 's arrest in 2001 .
" the democratic party will be the key player in the future cabinet , " said tadic .
" the negotiations will not be easy -lrb- but -rrb- i warn everyone not to play with the electoral will of the citizens and try to take serbia back to the isolation of the 1990s , " he said in reference to the milosevic regime . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the citizens of serbia have undoubtedly confirmed a clear european path , " president boris tadic , the flag-bearer of the pro-european forces , told jubilant supporters overnight .
" it is necessary to form a government as soon as possible , " tadic said in his ds campaign headquarters .
serbians celebrate in the streets the results sparked fireworks and celebrations on the streets of belgrade , where cars draped in serbian , ds and eu flags honked their horns as they drove around the city centre .
if confirmed , the election results will be seen as a breakthrough for serbia , which has struggled for political unity on the goal of eventual eu membership since late dictator slobodan milosevic was ousted eight years ago .
" i think that the european future of serbia is guaranteed , " said zoran lucic of the non-governmental centre for free elections and democracy -lrb- cesid -rrb- , whose latest estimates gave the ds coalition 38.7 percent versus 29.1 percent for the radicals .
eu presidency hails victory the eu 's slovenian presidency hailed what it called " a clear victory " by pro-european forces , adding it hoped a new government would soon be formed " with a clear european agenda . "
tadic 's democrats will now need to form a coalition with at least one other party - the socialists , founded by milosevic , or the liberal democrats , whose leader cedomir jovanovic negotiated the late dictator 's arrest in 2001 .
" the democratic party will be the key player in the future cabinet , " said tadic .
" the negotiations will not be easy -lrb- but -rrb- i warn everyone not to play with the electoral will of the citizens and try to take serbia back to the isolation of the 1990s , " he said in reference to the milosevic regime . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .

" we are ready to assist if the need arises , " european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel said in brussels .
the commission 's humanitarian aid department -lrb- echo -rrb- was in contact with the international red cross federation in geneva , and its office in bangkok had contacted the chinese red cross , according to michel .
" the initial news from sichuan is worrying , " michel said .
" actual information is very sketchy but it seems likely that the quake has caused substantial damage over a considerable area , and there are already reports of some loss of life . "
at least 8,500 died in sichuan province and scores died in neighboring regions .
the death toll was expected to climb significantly , the reports said .
germany sends condolences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people evacuated buildings in beijing after the quake german chancellor angela merkel sent her condolences to chinese premier wen jiabao over the heavy loss of life .
an official statement quoted the chancellor as saying the german government was also ready to provide speedy assistance .
beichuan county in sichuan province reported earlier that between 3,000 and 5,000 people were feared dead after the earthquake caused 80 percent of buildings to collapse , the official xinhua news agency said .
the agency said officials also estimated that about 10,000 people were injured in beichuan , which is about 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the epicenter of the earthquake .
no reports from the epicenter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a water pipe blew out during the earthquake , flooding the streets of chengdu by late monday evening there were still no reports from wenchuan county , the nearest town to the epicenter , which has a population of 112,000 .
the earthquake struck at 2:28 pm -lrb- 0628 gmt -rrb- in wenchuan county , and could be felt in cities hundreds of kilometers away , including beijing , shanghai , hong kong and bangkok .
at least four teenagers were confirmed dead after the earthquake caused school buildings to collapse and bury nearly 900 students at the juyuan middle school in sichuan 's dujiangyan city , about 100 kilometers from the epicenter , reports said .
one dujiangyan resident told german news agency dpa by telephone that her five-story apartment block and many other buildings in the city were seriously damaged by the earthquake .

" progress in the solution of frozen conflicts in georgia and moldova is a direct condition for the successful result of the eu talks with russia , " vaitiekunas said .

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .
relations have reached a standoff since russia 's subsequent declaration that it would increase peacekeeping troops in the region and was ready to intervene to protect abkhaz citizen 's , most of whom hold russian passports . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the european union reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders , " slovenia 's foreign minister dmitrij rupel , whose country currently chairs the eu presidency , was quoted by itar-tass as saying on monday , april 12 .
the foreign ministers of five european states - latvia , lithuania , poland , sweden and slovenia - were in the georgian capital monday to probe into escalating tension between moscow and tbilisi over russia 's support for the breakaway region of abkhazia .
georgian president mikhail saakashvili pleaded for the eu and nato 's support against what it called russia efforts to annex part of its territory since moscow strengthened diplomatic and economic ties to the area last month .
saakashvili said europe had abandoned georgia to the soviet union once in 1921 and he " hoped that europe will not repeat this mistake . "
" it is not only a question for georgia , but for the future of europe as well , " he said .
mutual accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili said the two countries were on the verge of a military conflict the united states and the eu have become increasingly embroiled in georgia and russia 's dispute as the two found a platform in nato in which to trade mutual accusations of troop increases .
saakashvili warned on thursday that the situation was " very close " to war , but assured eu leaders on monday that he was intent on brokering a peaceful solution .
but the comments on monday were overshadowed as abkhaz rebels claimed to have shot two more georgian spy planes .
the drones would be the sixth shot down over abkhazia in recent weeks .
tbilisi meanwhile denied that any of its spy planes had been shot down on monday .
the latest russo-georgian military accusations first exploded when tbilisi attributed the loss of its first spy plane to the work of a russian fighter jet .
moscow denied involvement and said the flights broke un a ceasefire that ended the civil war in 1994 .
relations have reached a standoff since russia 's subsequent declaration that it would increase peacekeeping troops in the region and was ready to intervene to protect abkhaz citizen 's , most of whom hold russian passports . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but both countries are struggling to change misperceptions and enhance business relations . michael theis sat down with a group of several dozen german businessmen on wednesday , may 7 to talk about a country they knew little about : israel . many medium-sized german business owners see israel as a conflict zone .
they know it 's famous for growing oranges and that 's where their knowledge ends , theis said . yet theis , a founder of the consulting company isucon partners who became sold on israel during his venture capital days , said the german businessmen at the recent meeting held in the eastern german city of halle became very interested when he started explaining israel 's high tech prowess and demand for quality consumer goods . " they were really excited and wanted to know how they can enter the market , " theis said .
" i told them , if you have high-quality products , then you have a chance in israel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has excelled in biotech misperceptions persist though the german media have pumped up coverage of israel in conjunction with the country 's 60th birthday on thursday , may 8 , there has been scant attention paid to economic issues . israelis accuse germany of being willfully ignorant of the economic transformation which their country has undergone , often preferring to think of israel as an agricultural backwater . " israel is a player in this global world , " former israeli ambassador to germany shimon stein said .
" we are not a country who is looking for charity or a kind of third world country that looks for development aid . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's technology sector is thriving nearly 75 percent of israeli exports to germany come in the form of high-tech goods , according to the german-israeli chamber of commerce . yet not all of the blame for misperceptions lies with germany .
israel needs to do a better job of showing that it can provide the quality and innovation that german companies demand , said stein , who founded international consulting after leaving the ambassador post in 2007 . " it is business .
it is not emotions , it is not memories , " stein said .
" what i have always been advocating is that business is a win-win situation .
you come , explore .
if you see that it 's not good for you , go elsewhere . " unequal trade continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's landscape has changed dramatically in the past 60 years germany-israel economic relations started more than a decade before diplomatic relations were established in 1965 when germany began providing reparations , mostly in the form of machinery . over the following decades , germany 's exports to israel have remained fairly constant and include machinery , precision tools , chemical products and consumer goods . the amount of trade between the two countries toped $ 5.4 billion -lrb- 3.5 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 and has had an average yearly growth rate of 9 percent since 1960 , according to the chamber of commerce . while german corporate giants such as siemens , telekom , sap and volkwagen have been investing heavily in israel for years , and in some cases decades , medium-sized german companies are less likely to have business relations with israeli companies . from the other direction , israeli firms have long seen germany as a key trade partner , and it remains second only to the united states .
israeli companies are investing billions in germany 's real estate market . the trade inequality has also remained constant .
germany exports to israel are twice what it imports .
that generally holds true for all of europe , said grisha alroi-arloser , head of the german-israeli chamber -lrb- ahk israel -rrb- . " israel is buying in europe and selling in the us , " alroi said . business not on political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is a leader in solar technology alroi would like to see germany increase its direct investment to israel and for israeli products to have a stronger presence in the german market .
ideally , the trade amounts between the two countries would be more balanced , alroi said . however , vardina hilloo , a dusseldorf-based business journalist who grew up in israel , is somewhat more pessimistic about the desire from both sides to improve on the status quo .
hilloo started the online magazine israfocus three years ago which aims to educate the german and european business community about israeli business and economic topics . from the german side , hilloo sees not only a troubling level of ignorance among german businessmen but also a disinterest among german politicians . she pointed to the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers .
the christian democrat plans to travel to the region for the fourth time on may 31 .
yet hilloo said she was discouraged to hear that the state leader does not have any major economic initiatives on his agenda . " it 's quite frustrating , " hilloo said . boycotts lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german businessmen see israel foremost as a conflict zone in the decades after world war ii boycotts against german products were common and there are still israelis who would never buy a volkswagen as the company is tied in some memories to nazi atrocities against jews . for years , the israeli government avoided the controversy by buying volvos .
yet in 2007 the israeli government raised eyebrows by announced it had awarded a government contract to audi and skoda , both owned by volkswagen .
the decision drew calls for a boycott from the religious party shas . " private people are entitled to drive any car they choose to , but we -lsb- the government -rsb- should be careful about the message we give to the public , " shas minister yitzhak cohen said in a letter to prime minister ehud olmert . yet boycotts are the exception , not the rule , experts say .
for the most part , german consumer goods enjoy the same reputation they do in most countries . most israelis have no problem buying a german car or washing machine , if they can afford the high price tags , alroi said , adding that many german products were available in israeli stores . former ambassador stein agreed that boycotts are mainly a thing of the past . " you will always find israelis who will boycott german goods .
but that is rather a negligible minority , " stein said . different ways of doing business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sap has bought israeli startups theis , of isucon partners , said in his seven years of doing business with israeli companies , the holocaust comes up as a topic , but he has never experienced bitterness or felt it was a barrier . but plenty of cultural gaps exist , theis added .
isucon partners mainly helping israeli companies who want to open a subsidiary or are looking for partners in europe , acting as a sort of matchmaker and cultural go-between . theis often finds himself coaching israeli businessmen on the german style of business .
israelis will tend to call on friday to try and set up a meeting for monday , something which throws german partners who " are not that flexible , " theis said .
german managers are also used to entering meetings with figures and presentations while israelis tend to be more spontaneous . " i have to tell my clients , ' please prepare a small 10-page presentation and bring products with you , " ' theis said . yet he sees a willingness from both sides to improve business relations .
in 2007 , theis organized a delegation of 30 people from leipzig to travel to israel .
it was a mix of politicians , businessmen and the odd filmmaker .
the trip generated contacts and excitement and a follow-up trip is planned for october . theis said he is continuously surprised at how eager everyone he meets is to get down to business . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hilloo started the online magazine israfocus three years ago which aims to educate the german and european business community about israeli business and economic topics . from the german side , hilloo sees not only a troubling level of ignorance among german businessmen but also a disinterest among german politicians . she pointed to the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers .

" unequal trade continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's landscape has changed dramatically in the past 60 years germany-israel economic relations started more than a decade before diplomatic relations were established in 1965 when germany began providing reparations , mostly in the form of machinery . over the following decades , germany 's exports to israel have remained fairly constant and include machinery , precision tools , chemical products and consumer goods . the amount of trade between the two countries toped $ 5.4 billion -lrb- 3.5 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 and has had an average yearly growth rate of 9 percent since 1960 , according to the chamber of commerce . while german corporate giants such as siemens , telekom , sap and volkwagen have been investing heavily in israel for years , and in some cases decades , medium-sized german companies are less likely to have business relations with israeli companies . from the other direction , israeli firms have long seen germany as a key trade partner , and it remains second only to the united states .
israeli companies are investing billions in germany 's real estate market . the trade inequality has also remained constant .
germany exports to israel are twice what it imports .
that generally holds true for all of europe , said grisha alroi-arloser , head of the german-israeli chamber -lrb- ahk israel -rrb- . " israel is buying in europe and selling in the us , " alroi said . business not on political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel is a leader in solar technology alroi would like to see germany increase its direct investment to israel and for israeli products to have a stronger presence in the german market .
ideally , the trade amounts between the two countries would be more balanced , alroi said . however , vardina hilloo , a dusseldorf-based business journalist who grew up in israel , is somewhat more pessimistic about the desire from both sides to improve on the status quo .
hilloo started the online magazine israfocus three years ago which aims to educate the german and european business community about israeli business and economic topics . from the german side , hilloo sees not only a troubling level of ignorance among german businessmen but also a disinterest among german politicians . she pointed to the premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , juergen ruettgers .
the christian democrat plans to travel to the region for the fourth time on may 31 .
yet hilloo said she was discouraged to hear that the state leader does not have any major economic initiatives on his agenda . " it 's quite frustrating , " hilloo said . boycotts lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german businessmen see israel foremost as a conflict zone in the decades after world war ii boycotts against german products were common and there are still israelis who would never buy a volkswagen as the company is tied in some memories to nazi atrocities against jews . for years , the israeli government avoided the controversy by buying volvos .
yet in 2007 the israeli government raised eyebrows by announced it had awarded a government contract to audi and skoda , both owned by volkswagen .
the decision drew calls for a boycott from the religious party shas . " private people are entitled to drive any car they choose to , but we -lsb- the government -rsb- should be careful about the message we give to the public , " shas minister yitzhak cohen said in a letter to prime minister ehud olmert . yet boycotts are the exception , not the rule , experts say .
for the most part , german consumer goods enjoy the same reputation they do in most countries . most israelis have no problem buying a german car or washing machine , if they can afford the high price tags , alroi said , adding that many german products were available in israeli stores . former ambassador stein agreed that boycotts are mainly a thing of the past . " you will always find israelis who will boycott german goods .
but that is rather a negligible minority , " stein said . different ways of doing business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sap has bought israeli startups theis , of isucon partners , said in his seven years of doing business with israeli companies , the holocaust comes up as a topic , but he has never experienced bitterness or felt it was a barrier . but plenty of cultural gaps exist , theis added .
isucon partners mainly helping israeli companies who want to open a subsidiary or are looking for partners in europe , acting as a sort of matchmaker and cultural go-between . theis often finds himself coaching israeli businessmen on the german style of business .
israelis will tend to call on friday to try and set up a meeting for monday , something which throws german partners who " are not that flexible , " theis said .
german managers are also used to entering meetings with figures and presentations while israelis tend to be more spontaneous . " i have to tell my clients , ' please prepare a small 10-page presentation and bring products with you , " ' theis said . yet he sees a willingness from both sides to improve business relations .
in 2007 , theis organized a delegation of 30 people from leipzig to travel to israel .
it was a mix of politicians , businessmen and the odd filmmaker .
the trip generated contacts and excitement and a follow-up trip is planned for october . theis said he is continuously surprised at how eager everyone he meets is to get down to business . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 2,000 representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations are attending the five-day conference , the outcome of which was unclear in view of the divergent positions .
protesters from 80 agricultural and environmental organizations demonstrated against hunger , species extinction and genetic engineering outside the hotel where the conference is taking place .
the meeting of the parties to the cartagena protocol on biosafety is seeking to work out a system of rules on protection rights and liability relating to the cross-border movement of genetically modified organisms such as rice , corn or soy .
protecting humans and the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers want to know what kind of product they 're buying the regulations are intended to protect humans and the environment from possible dangers arising from the use of gene technology in crop fields or forests .
there are no legally defined redress and liability elements in the cartagena protocol , making it difficult to determine who can claim and who has to pay for economic , health or environmental damage .
some 147 countries are signatories to the protocol , but the united states , canada and argentina - major agricultural producers with substantial genetic engineering operations - have not signed .
critics accused six major biotechnology concerns of seeking to obtain non-binding regulations for liability and compensation .
they include germany 's bayer cropscience and the us multinational monsanto .
" their goal is to privatize international law-making , " said christine von weizsaecker , president of the environmental institute ecoropa .
planet diversity parallel to the conference , environmental and farmers ' organizations from 90 countries are holding their own alternative gathering called planet diversity .
the bonn conference comes a week before the mammoth convention of the body that implements the un 's convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- .
some 5,000 representatives from 190 countries are participating in the conference , among them german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon and brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva .
the agenda includes the destruction of indigenous forests and the plundering of the sea , as well as how to counter the resulting loss of biodiversity . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

everyone in pakistan agrees that president pervez musharraf 's dismissal of supreme and high court judges under emergency rule last year was unconstitutional .
even he has admitted this .
and the country 's new , democratically-elected government has vowed to restore the sacked judges .
so why is the issue dragging on without resolution ?
the controversy has focused on the deposed chief justice , iftikhar mohammed chaudhry .
mr chaudhry stepped on a lot of toes while head of the supreme court .
he held the ruling elite to account .
he rattled the security establishment by pursuing the case of the " missing " - alleged terror suspects abducted and held incommunicado by pakistan 's intelligence services . "
we need to be sure that we do n't plunge pakistan into another constitutional crisis " information minister sherry rehman send your comments and he took up legal challenges to president musharraf 's re-election .
that was his biggest sin in the eyes of pakistan 's military establishment .
last november , the president used emergency rule to get rid of him and other troublesome judges .
' principles ' mr chaudhry 's critics say he played politics .
his supporters say he stood up to interference from a military ruler .
for them , his reinstatement has become the symbol of judicial independence .
" if we compromised on the chief justice then we would n't have a principled stand ! " says tariq mehmood , a former president of the supreme court bar association .
" how can we digest this ?
that you restore the rest of the judges and you do not restore the chief justice - and he was the head of the institution .
we can not ignore him ! "
the case became a live issue in february 's elections .
former prime minister nawaz sharif staked his campaign on a promise to restore the sacked judges , including the chief justice .
now mr sharif and his pakistan muslim league -lrb- pml-n -rrb- have to deliver .
" it 's the word of the pml-n , the credibility of the pml-n , the commitment that they 've been fighting for , a free judiciary , " says member of parliament ayaz amir .
nawaz sharif did much better at the ballot box than expected .
so well , in fact , that the main election winner , asif zardari 's pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , had to form a coalition with him .
mr sharif had one condition : reinstate the judges .
sacked judges march 2007 : president musharraf suspends supreme court chief justice , triggering protests 6 oct 2007 : president musharraf wins election 3 nov 2007 : president declares state of emergency and sacks around 60 judges 22 nov 2007 : new supreme court upholds musharraf election win 18 feb 2008 : new coalition government of ppp and pml-n emerge victorious in parliamentary polls 30 april 2008 : deadline set by two parties to reinstate sacked judges 12 may 2008 : second deadline to restore judges q & a : pakistan 's judges analysis : no easy task of course president musharraf is against this .
he fears a reconstituted supreme court would rule his election and / or state of emergency unconstitutional .
it 's believed mr sharif is counting on the restored judges to do so .
he 's said mr musharraf should be impeached .
the president has been weakened , but he 's not ready to go just yet .
according to reports he 's prepared to give up certain of his powers if the authority of the chief justice is also clipped .
political sources say mr musharraf 's strongest backers - the americans and the army - think that 's a fair trade .
certainly , the pakistan people 's party does n't want any more political turmoil .
" we need to be sure that we do n't plunge pakistan into another constitutional crisis that will lead to further instability and chaos , " says information minister sherry rehman .
" we are going to see to it that we pursue the policies of moderation and a peaceful transition . "
' complex contradiction ' but many believe there 's more to it than that .
a peaceful transition from military to civilian rule was part of a western-backed plan that brought the ppp 's late leader benazir bhutto back from exile last year .
under the terms of the deal , the then general musharraf was to grant senior ppp leaders amnesty from corruption charges , step down as army chief and allow the party to contest relatively free and fair elections .
in exchange , ms bhutto agreed to support him as a civilian president .
since president musharraf delivered his side of the bargain , there is pressure on ms bhutto 's widower , asif zardari , to deliver hers , says political analyst rasul baksh rais .
" i think there 's been an understanding between pervez musharraf and asif zardari on the one hand , and on the other , between mr zardari and nawaz sharif , " he says .
" the understanding between the latter is that the judges would be restored , and the understanding between the former is that mr musharraf would continue as president , but there is a complex contradiction between the two . "
there is personal animus too .
in an interview with the bbc mr zardari has accused iftikhar chaudhry of complicity in a campaign to victimise him while imprisoned on what he says were trumped up murder and corruption charges in the 1990s and early part of this decade .
he 's also said he remains committed to his pledge to reinstate the judges .
but how to do so without either breaking up the coalition or challenging the president ?
for lawyers and civil activists the issue is simple : president musharraf has acted illegally and unconstitutionally , and must suffer the consequences .
the chief justice took a principled stand and must be restored .
in the corridors of power , however , there are tortuous negotiations to try and square the circle , to reach a compromise that 's " acceptable to all the stakeholders " , according to one senior ppp source .
a difficult task indeed , in a country where many of the stakeholders are unacceptable to each other .

sacked judges march 2007 : president musharraf suspends supreme court chief justice , triggering protests 6 oct 2007 : president musharraf wins election 3 nov 2007 : president declares state of emergency and sacks around 60 judges 22 nov 2007 : new supreme court upholds musharraf election win 18 feb 2008 : new coalition government of ppp and pml-n emerge victorious in parliamentary polls 30 april 2008 : deadline set by two parties to reinstate sacked judges 12 may 2008 : second deadline to restore judges q & a : pakistan 's judges analysis : no easy task of course president musharraf is against this .
he fears a reconstituted supreme court would rule his election and / or state of emergency unconstitutional .
it 's believed mr sharif is counting on the restored judges to do so .
he 's said mr musharraf should be impeached .
the president has been weakened , but he 's not ready to go just yet .
according to reports he 's prepared to give up certain of his powers if the authority of the chief justice is also clipped .
political sources say mr musharraf 's strongest backers - the americans and the army - think that 's a fair trade .
certainly , the pakistan people 's party does n't want any more political turmoil .
" we need to be sure that we do n't plunge pakistan into another constitutional crisis that will lead to further instability and chaos , " says information minister sherry rehman .
" we are going to see to it that we pursue the policies of moderation and a peaceful transition . "
' complex contradiction ' but many believe there 's more to it than that .
a peaceful transition from military to civilian rule was part of a western-backed plan that brought the ppp 's late leader benazir bhutto back from exile last year .
under the terms of the deal , the then general musharraf was to grant senior ppp leaders amnesty from corruption charges , step down as army chief and allow the party to contest relatively free and fair elections .
in exchange , ms bhutto agreed to support him as a civilian president .
president musharraf is not smiling so much these days since president musharraf delivered his side of the bargain , there is pressure on ms bhutto 's widower , asif zardari , to deliver hers , says political analyst rasul baksh rais .
" i think there 's been an understanding between pervez musharraf and asif zardari on the one hand , and on the other , between mr zardari and nawaz sharif , " he says .
" the understanding between the latter is that the judges would be restored , and the understanding between the former is that mr musharraf would continue as president , but there is a complex contradiction between the two . "
there is personal animus too .
in an interview with the bbc mr zardari has accused iftikhar chaudhry of complicity in a campaign to victimise him while imprisoned on what he says were trumped up murder and corruption charges in the 1990s and early part of this decade .
he 's also said he remains committed to his pledge to reinstate the judges .
but how to do so without either breaking up the coalition or challenging the president ?
for lawyers and civil activists the issue is simple : president musharraf has acted illegally and unconstitutionally , and must suffer the consequences .
the chief justice took a principled stand and must be restored .
in the corridors of power , however , there are tortuous negotiations to try and square the circle , to reach a compromise that 's " acceptable to all the stakeholders " , according to one senior ppp source .
a difficult task indeed , in a country where many of the stakeholders are unacceptable to each other .

the controversy has focused on the deposed chief justice , iftikhar mohammed chaudhry .
mr chaudhry stepped on a lot of toes while head of the supreme court .
he held the ruling elite to account .
he rattled the security establishment by pursuing the case of the " missing " - alleged terror suspects abducted and held incommunicado by pakistan 's intelligence services .
we need to be sure that we do n't plunge pakistan into another constitutional crisis information minister sherry rehman send your comments and he took up legal challenges to president musharraf 's re-election .

" how can we digest this ?

the case became a live issue in february 's elections .
former prime minister nawaz sharif staked his campaign on a promise to restore the sacked judges , including the chief justice .

an estimated 12,000 young people are not in training , education or employment , so-called " neets " .
the assembly government is launching a new strategy which includes legislation to provide more options and support for young people .
it also wants authorities to work more quickly to help the young " disengaged " .
the assembly government says despite some progress in tackling the problem , the number of young people classed as neets in wales remains unacceptably high - at 10 % of all 16-18-year-olds .
it wants to ensure councils , schools and further education institutions work together to deliver more attractive and flexible learning options .
for those struggling to find any sort of employment , the assembly government has pledged to work more closely with the uk government 's department of work and pensions to fast-track them straight on to the new deal - a programme that gives people training while they look for work .
deputy minister for skills john griffiths , from the assembly government , is launching a consultation for the strategy .
he said : " we want to ensure that as many young people as possible choose to stay in learning after the age of 16 , including those facing the toughest challenges . "

credit action says adverts promising cheap loans for people with poor credit ratings are appearing on the site and many break advertising regulations .
in particular , they are promoting two new products - payday loans secured against a salary or logbook loans secured against a car , it says .
the charity has made a complaint to the office of fair trading .
credit action says many of the adverts contravene uk credit advertising regulations , usually by failing to give details of interest rates .
it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular credit action it is now advising facebook users to warn the website about adverts which break the rules .
a charity spokesman said : " social networking sites , facebook in particular , have become hugely popular in recent times , and not just with users .
" lots of credit companies , especially payday and logbook loans companies , are using the medium to advertise their products .
" it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular . "
' make it clear ' chairman of credit action 's board of trustees , malcolm hurlston , said that advertising rules " are there for a reason " .
he added : " they are there to make it clear to people from the beginning what they are letting themselves in for . "
mr hurlston also said some adverts do include the rates of apr but only in the frequently asked questions section , and not prominently on the advert , which is what the rules require .
bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones says the adverts are being placed at a time when it has become harder to borrow from traditional sources .
facebook , along with its main rivals bebo and myspace , lets users set up personal web pages and communicate with each other .
it has an estimated 50 million members worldwide and figures released earlier this year suggest that it has 8.5 million uk-based users .
read a selection of your comments on this story : i 'm a facebook user and i think its ridiculous how credit companies can advertise such high rate apr loans on a social network site who 's main audience is teenagers and young adults .
the majority are students who have a poor credit rating anyway , they 're like vultures waiting for vulnerable young adults , these kind of credit companies do more harm than good , instead of helping improve credit situations , in most cases , they make it worse .
if someone has a poor credit rating it is because they can not control their own spending , so by giving them more money it 's a disaster waiting to happen pally , wolverhampton i saw an advert for payday uk and attempted to go through their application form .
once i had completed all of the required fields it asked me to enter an authorisation code that was sent by sms .
this code did not arrive and when i queried this with the helpline i got the answer that i needed to send a copy of my passport to them despite it being all over the site that no documentation was needed .
at this point i got cold feet and asked them to remove my details as i was not going to complete the process .
to this i was told they are legally oblidged to keep my account details -lrb- bank & debit card -rrb- on file for 6 years .
i am not happy and am trying to ascertain whether this is legal or not .
jon poste , leicester i recently complained to the fsa regarding payday uk , who offer loans at 1355 % apr .
it seems unreal .
on their website they also provide information about what apr means - but this is totally misleading .
they compare borrowing money over a 3 or 5 year period with their charges for one month , and suggest that their rates are cheaper !
the fsa 's response was : " neither the fsa nor the oft can intervene in or investigate complaints against firms on behalf of the public ... to make a complaint against the firm you should complain to the firm ... "
i am sure that the firm , payday uk , are fully aware that they are targeting young people who have no knowledge or understanding of finances .
i am also sure that the firm feels no remorse for preying on the vulnerabilities of their victims .
evidently , all payday uk obviously care about is money .
what then is the point of making a complaint to them , and detailing the above ?
i suspect their response might be something like : " dear damian , thank you for your compliments !
if you would like to arrange a loan with us we would be more than happy to prey on you too ! "
i strongly feel that there should be laws implemented to prevent these kinds of companies operating .
i also feel that facebook should be ashamed of making money by allowing these companies to advertise on their site .
damian , sheffield i think it is wrong , there are so many people preparing to go to uni at this time of year , and they may think , well if i get a loan i will be able to afford it .
its wrong and i feel personally that it is taking advantage of the younger generations .
victoria , grimsby i saw an advert where you can take out a loan as little as £ 70 to bout £ 2000 .
i was tempted to borrow jus £ 100 as i was skint that week and you ca n't really borrow small amounts of money like that anywhere else .
i do n't think it 's a good idea .
i just saw it and wanted it because i could .
charlotte , newport south wales the facebook advertising piece gives only limited space for text for advertisers .
as there is not enough space to meet regulatory requirements in the ads and deliver a marketing message , it makes sense for facebook to refuse ads from the financial services sector .
maybe also they should publish a code of conduct to all other advertisers which includes advertising standards agency guidelines and before facebook publish ads they confirm compliance against these .
ian hendry ian hendry , london , uk i noticed an advert for a ' payday ' loan on facebook , and out of curiosity i clicked on it to find out what it was - i was shocked by how misleading the marketing of the loan was ; it was cleverly done and could easily dupe vulnerable or naive individuals .
the value of the loans is low and it just seems like a completely pointless product , but i was left stunned when i discovered the apr breakdown : a whopping 1380 % .
that 's no typo !
tom , london facebook is responsive to user suggestions and complaints .
i was offended by a particular set of ads for " meet the babe of your dreams " and emailed them ; the ads stopped appearing on my profile within hours .
i am sure that facebook will respond equally well to credit action 's complaint .
this highlights a wider issue over us adverts appearing in a uk context , something the technology should be able to solve if done right .
stuart , staffordshire i find using firefox and adblock you can set it so that you do n't see the ads .
parents could set it up if they wanted so kids did n't see them at all .
john , teesside , uk you should be aware of the fact that not all facebook users are " young people " .
personally , i 'm 54 and quite a lot of my friends of similar age use it to stay in touch .
these ads do n't bother me , they 're just part of the background noise of using the net .
after all , someone has to pay for the upkeep of the system and i 'd rather it was advertisers than me .
steff , yeovil , uk have we lost all power of free will ?
there 's nobody pointing a gun to your head threatening to pull the trigger if you do n't click on one of these ads and take up the loan they advertise !
you can click on it , see the interest rate is humongous and close the page - or not click on it at all if you ca n't afford credit , simple as that .
dino mavridis , manchester , uk i 've seen the ads , i should think most people have .
i did n't think they were illegal and if they are they should be removed .
however , i ca n't help thinking , if you are silly enough to take one of these loans when they are so obviously an unregulated scam . you deserve the obvious outcome !
sara daintree , manchester , uk i use facebook and have certainly noticed the advertising boom since its early days .
the ads are often targeted , as keywords on your profile are used , but also often not at all and are just general .
sometimes they are actually useful ; i 'm a gamer and sometimes good offers come up .
other times it 's things like these debt ads .
i had noticed the payday loans and do think it 's disgusting that this kind of ad is allowed when users are generally of a young age and we 're mostly in debt from university anyway ! !

bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones says the adverts are being placed at a time when it has become harder to borrow from traditional sources .
facebook , along with its main rivals bebo and myspace , lets users set up personal web pages and communicate with each other .
it has an estimated 50 million members worldwide and figures released earlier this year suggest that it has 8.5 million uk-based users .
read a selection of your comments on this story : i 'm a facebook user and i think its ridiculous how credit companies can advertise such high rate apr loans on a social network site who 's main audience is teenagers and young adults .
the majority are students who have a poor credit rating anyway , they 're like vultures waiting for vulnerable young adults , these kind of credit companies do more harm than good , instead of helping improve credit situations , in most cases , they make it worse .
if someone has a poor credit rating it is because they can not control their own spending , so by giving them more money it 's a disaster waiting to happen pally , wolverhampton i saw an advert for payday uk and attempted to go through their application form .
once i had completed all of the required fields it asked me to enter an authorisation code that was sent by sms .
this code did not arrive and when i queried this with the helpline i got the answer that i needed to send a copy of my passport to them despite it being all over the site that no documentation was needed .
at this point i got cold feet and asked them to remove my details as i was not going to complete the process .
to this i was told they are legally oblidged to keep my account details -lrb- bank & debit card -rrb- on file for 6 years .
i am not happy and am trying to ascertain whether this is legal or not .
jon poste , leicester i recently complained to the fsa regarding payday uk , who offer loans at 1355 % apr .
it seems unreal .
on their website they also provide information about what apr means - but this is totally misleading .
they compare borrowing money over a 3 or 5 year period with their charges for one month , and suggest that their rates are cheaper !
the fsa 's response was : " neither the fsa nor the oft can intervene in or investigate complaints against firms on behalf of the public ... to make a complaint against the firm you should complain to the firm ... "
i am sure that the firm , payday uk , are fully aware that they are targeting young people who have no knowledge or understanding of finances .
i am also sure that the firm feels no remorse for preying on the vulnerabilities of their victims .
evidently , all payday uk obviously care about is money .
what then is the point of making a complaint to them , and detailing the above ?
i suspect their response might be something like : " dear damian , thank you for your compliments !
if you would like to arrange a loan with us we would be more than happy to prey on you too ! "
i strongly feel that there should be laws implemented to prevent these kinds of companies operating .
i also feel that facebook should be ashamed of making money by allowing these companies to advertise on their site .
damian , sheffield i think it is wrong , there are so many people preparing to go to uni at this time of year , and they may think , well if i get a loan i will be able to afford it .

charlotte , newport south wales the facebook advertising piece gives only limited space for text for advertisers .
as there is not enough space to meet regulatory requirements in the ads and deliver a marketing message , it makes sense for facebook to refuse ads from the financial services sector .

ian hendry ian hendry , london , uk i noticed an advert for a ' payday ' loan on facebook , and out of curiosity i clicked on it to find out what it was - i was shocked by how misleading the marketing of the loan was ; it was cleverly done and could easily dupe vulnerable or naive individuals .
the value of the loans is low and it just seems like a completely pointless product , but i was left stunned when i discovered the apr breakdown : a whopping 1380 % .
that 's no typo !
tom , london facebook is responsive to user suggestions and complaints .
i was offended by a particular set of ads for " meet the babe of your dreams " and emailed them ; the ads stopped appearing on my profile within hours .
i am sure that facebook will respond equally well to credit action 's complaint .
this highlights a wider issue over us adverts appearing in a uk context , something the technology should be able to solve if done right .
stuart , staffordshire i find using firefox and adblock you can set it so that you do n't see the ads .

john , teesside , uk you should be aware of the fact that not all facebook users are " young people " .
personally , i 'm 54 and quite a lot of my friends of similar age use it to stay in touch .
these ads do n't bother me , they 're just part of the background noise of using the net .

you can click on it , see the interest rate is humongous and close the page - or not click on it at all if you ca n't afford credit , simple as that .
dino mavridis , manchester , uk i 've seen the ads , i should think most people have .
i did n't think they were illegal and if they are they should be removed .
however , i ca n't help thinking , if you are silly enough to take one of these loans when they are so obviously an unregulated scam . you deserve the obvious outcome !
sara daintree , manchester , uk i use facebook and have certainly noticed the advertising boom since its early days .
the ads are often targeted , as keywords on your profile are used , but also often not at all and are just general .
sometimes they are actually useful ; i 'm a gamer and sometimes good offers come up .
other times it 's things like these debt ads .
i had noticed the payday loans and do think it 's disgusting that this kind of ad is allowed when users are generally of a young age and we 're mostly in debt from university anyway ! !

credit action says adverts promising cheap loans for people with poor credit ratings are appearing on the site and many break advertising regulations .
in particular , they are promoting two new products - payday loans secured against a salary or logbook loans secured against a car , it says .
the charity has made a complaint to the office of fair trading .
credit action says many of the adverts contravene uk credit advertising regulations , usually by failing to give details of interest rates .
it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular credit action it is now advising facebook users to warn the website about adverts which break the rules .
a charity spokesman said : " social networking sites , facebook in particular , have become hugely popular in recent times , and not just with users .
" lots of credit companies , especially payday and logbook loans companies , are using the medium to advertise their products .
" it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular . "
' make it clear ' chairman of credit action 's board of trustees , malcolm hurlston , said that advertising rules " are there for a reason " .
he added : " they are there to make it clear to people from the beginning what they are letting themselves in for . "
mr hurlston also said some adverts do include the rates of apr but only in the frequently asked questions section , and not prominently on the advert , which is what the rules require .
bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones says the adverts are being placed at a time when it has become harder to borrow from traditional sources .
facebook , along with its main rivals bebo and myspace , lets users set up personal web pages and communicate with each other .
it has an estimated 50 million members worldwide and figures released earlier this year suggest that it has 8.5 million uk-based users .
read a selection of your comments on this story : i 'm a facebook user and i think its ridiculous how credit companies can advertise such high rate apr loans on a social network site who 's main audience is teenagers and young adults .
the majority are students who have a poor credit rating anyway , they 're like vultures waiting for vulnerable young adults , these kind of credit companies do more harm than good , instead of helping improve credit situations , in most cases , they make it worse .
if someone has a poor credit rating it is because they can not control their own spending , so by giving them more money it 's a disaster waiting to happen pally , wolverhampton i saw an advert for payday uk and attempted to go through their application form .
once i had completed all of the required fields it asked me to enter an authorisation code that was sent by sms .
this code did not arrive and when i queried this with the helpline i got the answer that i needed to send a copy of my passport to them despite it being all over the site that no documentation was needed .
at this point i got cold feet and asked them to remove my details as i was not going to complete the process .
to this i was told they are legally oblidged to keep my account details -lrb- bank & debit card -rrb- on file for 6 years .
i am not happy and am trying to ascertain whether this is legal or not .
jon poste , leicester i recently complained to the fsa regarding payday uk , who offer loans at 1355 % apr .
it seems unreal .
on their website they also provide information about what apr means - but this is totally misleading .
they compare borrowing money over a 3 or 5 year period with their charges for one month , and suggest that their rates are cheaper !
the fsa 's response was : " neither the fsa nor the oft can intervene in or investigate complaints against firms on behalf of the public ... to make a complaint against the firm you should complain to the firm ... "
i am sure that the firm , payday uk , are fully aware that they are targeting young people who have no knowledge or understanding of finances .
i am also sure that the firm feels no remorse for preying on the vulnerabilities of their victims .
evidently , all payday uk obviously care about is money .
what then is the point of making a complaint to them , and detailing the above ?
i suspect their response might be something like : " dear damian , thank you for your compliments !
if you would like to arrange a loan with us we would be more than happy to prey on you too ! "
i strongly feel that there should be laws implemented to prevent these kinds of companies operating .
i also feel that facebook should be ashamed of making money by allowing these companies to advertise on their site .
damian , sheffield i think it is wrong , there are so many people preparing to go to uni at this time of year , and they may think , well if i get a loan i will be able to afford it .
its wrong and i feel personally that it is taking advantage of the younger generations .
victoria , grimsby i saw an advert where you can take out a loan as little as £ 70 to bout £ 2000 .
i was tempted to borrow jus £ 100 as i was skint that week and you ca n't really borrow small amounts of money like that anywhere else .
i do n't think it 's a good idea .
i just saw it and wanted it because i could .
charlotte , newport south wales the facebook advertising piece gives only limited space for text for advertisers .
as there is not enough space to meet regulatory requirements in the ads and deliver a marketing message , it makes sense for facebook to refuse ads from the financial services sector .
maybe also they should publish a code of conduct to all other advertisers which includes advertising standards agency guidelines and before facebook publish ads they confirm compliance against these .
ian hendry ian hendry , london , uk i noticed an advert for a ' payday ' loan on facebook , and out of curiosity i clicked on it to find out what it was - i was shocked by how misleading the marketing of the loan was ; it was cleverly done and could easily dupe vulnerable or naive individuals .
the value of the loans is low and it just seems like a completely pointless product , but i was left stunned when i discovered the apr breakdown : a whopping 1380 % .
that 's no typo !
tom , london facebook is responsive to user suggestions and complaints .
i was offended by a particular set of ads for " meet the babe of your dreams " and emailed them ; the ads stopped appearing on my profile within hours .
i am sure that facebook will respond equally well to credit action 's complaint .
this highlights a wider issue over us adverts appearing in a uk context , something the technology should be able to solve if done right .
stuart , staffordshire i find using firefox and adblock you can set it so that you do n't see the ads .
parents could set it up if they wanted so kids did n't see them at all .
john , teesside , uk you should be aware of the fact that not all facebook users are " young people " .
personally , i 'm 54 and quite a lot of my friends of similar age use it to stay in touch .
these ads do n't bother me , they 're just part of the background noise of using the net .
after all , someone has to pay for the upkeep of the system and i 'd rather it was advertisers than me .
steff , yeovil , uk have we lost all power of free will ?
there 's nobody pointing a gun to your head threatening to pull the trigger if you do n't click on one of these ads and take up the loan they advertise !
you can click on it , see the interest rate is humongous and close the page - or not click on it at all if you ca n't afford credit , simple as that .
dino mavridis , manchester , uk i 've seen the ads , i should think most people have .
i did n't think they were illegal and if they are they should be removed .
however , i ca n't help thinking , if you are silly enough to take one of these loans when they are so obviously an unregulated scam . you deserve the obvious outcome !
sara daintree , manchester , uk i use facebook and have certainly noticed the advertising boom since its early days .
the ads are often targeted , as keywords on your profile are used , but also often not at all and are just general .
sometimes they are actually useful ; i 'm a gamer and sometimes good offers come up .
other times it 's things like these debt ads .
i had noticed the payday loans and do think it 's disgusting that this kind of ad is allowed when users are generally of a young age and we 're mostly in debt from university anyway ! !

credit action says adverts promising cheap loans for people with poor credit ratings are appearing on the site and many break advertising regulations .
in particular , they are promoting two new products - payday loans secured against a salary or logbook loans secured against a car , it says .
the charity has made a complaint to the office of fair trading .
credit action says many of the adverts contravene uk credit advertising regulations , usually by failing to give details of interest rates .
it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular credit action it is now advising facebook users to warn the website about adverts which break the rules .
a charity spokesman said : " social networking sites , facebook in particular , have become hugely popular in recent times , and not just with users .
" lots of credit companies , especially payday and logbook loans companies , are using the medium to advertise their products .
" it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular . "
' make it clear ' chairman of credit action 's board of trustees , malcolm hurlston , said that advertising rules " are there for a reason " .
he added : " they are there to make it clear to people from the beginning what they are letting themselves in for . "
mr hurlston also said some adverts do include the rates of apr but only in the frequently asked questions section , and not prominently on the advert , which is what the rules require .
bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones says the adverts are being placed at a time when it has become harder to borrow from traditional sources .
facebook , along with its main rivals bebo and myspace , lets users set up personal web pages and communicate with each other .
it has an estimated 50 million members worldwide and figures released earlier this year suggest that it has 8.5 million uk-based users .
read a selection of your comments on this story : i 'm a facebook user and i think its ridiculous how credit companies can advertise such high rate apr loans on a social network site who 's main audience is teenagers and young adults .
the majority are students who have a poor credit rating anyway , they 're like vultures waiting for vulnerable young adults , these kind of credit companies do more harm than good , instead of helping improve credit situations , in most cases , they make it worse .
if someone has a poor credit rating it is because they can not control their own spending , so by giving them more money it 's a disaster waiting to happen pally , wolverhampton i saw an advert for payday uk and attempted to go through their application form .
once i had completed all of the required fields it asked me to enter an authorisation code that was sent by sms .
this code did not arrive and when i queried this with the helpline i got the answer that i needed to send a copy of my passport to them despite it being all over the site that no documentation was needed .
at this point i got cold feet and asked them to remove my details as i was not going to complete the process .
to this i was told they are legally oblidged to keep my account details -lrb- bank & debit card -rrb- on file for 6 years .
i am not happy and am trying to ascertain whether this is legal or not .
jon poste , leicester i recently complained to the fsa regarding payday uk , who offer loans at 1355 % apr .
it seems unreal .
on their website they also provide information about what apr means - but this is totally misleading .
they compare borrowing money over a 3 or 5 year period with their charges for one month , and suggest that their rates are cheaper !
the fsa 's response was : " neither the fsa nor the oft can intervene in or investigate complaints against firms on behalf of the public ... to make a complaint against the firm you should complain to the firm ... "
i am sure that the firm , payday uk , are fully aware that they are targeting young people who have no knowledge or understanding of finances .
i am also sure that the firm feels no remorse for preying on the vulnerabilities of their victims .
evidently , all payday uk obviously care about is money .
what then is the point of making a complaint to them , and detailing the above ?
i suspect their response might be something like : " dear damian , thank you for your compliments !
if you would like to arrange a loan with us we would be more than happy to prey on you too ! "
i strongly feel that there should be laws implemented to prevent these kinds of companies operating .
i also feel that facebook should be ashamed of making money by allowing these companies to advertise on their site .
damian , sheffield i think it is wrong , there are so many people preparing to go to uni at this time of year , and they may think , well if i get a loan i will be able to afford it .
its wrong and i feel personally that it is taking advantage of the younger generations .
victoria , grimsby i saw an advert where you can take out a loan as little as £ 70 to bout £ 2000 .
i was tempted to borrow jus £ 100 as i was skint that week and you ca n't really borrow small amounts of money like that anywhere else .
i do n't think it 's a good idea .
i just saw it and wanted it because i could .
charlotte , newport south wales the facebook advertising piece gives only limited space for text for advertisers .
as there is not enough space to meet regulatory requirements in the ads and deliver a marketing message , it makes sense for facebook to refuse ads from the financial services sector .
maybe also they should publish a code of conduct to all other advertisers which includes advertising standards agency guidelines and before facebook publish ads they confirm compliance against these .
ian hendry ian hendry , london , uk i noticed an advert for a ' payday ' loan on facebook , and out of curiosity i clicked on it to find out what it was - i was shocked by how misleading the marketing of the loan was ; it was cleverly done and could easily dupe vulnerable or naive individuals .
the value of the loans is low and it just seems like a completely pointless product , but i was left stunned when i discovered the apr breakdown : a whopping 1380 % .
that 's no typo !
tom , london facebook is responsive to user suggestions and complaints .
i was offended by a particular set of ads for " meet the babe of your dreams " and emailed them ; the ads stopped appearing on my profile within hours .
i am sure that facebook will respond equally well to credit action 's complaint .
this highlights a wider issue over us adverts appearing in a uk context , something the technology should be able to solve if done right .
stuart , staffordshire i find using firefox and adblock you can set it so that you do n't see the ads .
parents could set it up if they wanted so kids did n't see them at all .
john , teesside , uk you should be aware of the fact that not all facebook users are " young people " .
personally , i 'm 54 and quite a lot of my friends of similar age use it to stay in touch .
these ads do n't bother me , they 're just part of the background noise of using the net .
after all , someone has to pay for the upkeep of the system and i 'd rather it was advertisers than me .
steff , yeovil , uk have we lost all power of free will ?
there 's nobody pointing a gun to your head threatening to pull the trigger if you do n't click on one of these ads and take up the loan they advertise !
you can click on it , see the interest rate is humongous and close the page - or not click on it at all if you ca n't afford credit , simple as that .
dino mavridis , manchester , uk i 've seen the ads , i should think most people have .
i did n't think they were illegal and if they are they should be removed .
however , i ca n't help thinking , if you are silly enough to take one of these loans when they are so obviously an unregulated scam . you deserve the obvious outcome !
sara daintree , manchester , uk i use facebook and have certainly noticed the advertising boom since its early days .
the ads are often targeted , as keywords on your profile are used , but also often not at all and are just general .
sometimes they are actually useful ; i 'm a gamer and sometimes good offers come up .
other times it 's things like these debt ads .

these ads do n't bother me , they 're just part of the background noise of using the net .
after all , someone has to pay for the upkeep of the system and i 'd rather it was advertisers than me .
steff , yeovil , uk have we lost all power of free will ?
there 's nobody pointing a gun to your head threatening to pull the trigger if you do n't click on one of these ads and take up the loan they advertise !
you can click on it , see the interest rate is humongous and close the page - or not click on it at all if you ca n't afford credit , simple as that .
dino mavridis , manchester , uk i 've seen the ads , i should think most people have .
i did n't think they were illegal and if they are they should be removed .
however , i ca n't help thinking , if you are silly enough to take one of these loans when they are so obviously an unregulated scam . you deserve the obvious outcome !
sara daintree , manchester , uk i use facebook and have certainly noticed the advertising boom since its early days .
the ads are often targeted , as keywords on your profile are used , but also often not at all and are just general .
sometimes they are actually useful ; i 'm a gamer and sometimes good offers come up .
other times it 's things like these debt ads .
i had noticed the payday loans and do think it 's disgusting that this kind of ad is allowed when users are generally of a young age and we 're mostly in debt from university anyway ! !

credit action says adverts promising cheap loans for people with poor credit ratings are appearing on the site and many break advertising regulations .
in particular , they are promoting two new products - payday loans secured against a salary or logbook loans secured against a car , it says .
the charity has made a complaint to the office of fair trading .
credit action says many of the adverts contravene uk credit advertising regulations , usually by failing to give details of interest rates . "
it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular " credit action it is now advising facebook users to warn the website about adverts which break the rules .
a charity spokesman said : " social networking sites , facebook in particular , have become hugely popular in recent times , and not just with users .
" lots of credit companies , especially payday and logbook loans companies , are using the medium to advertise their products .
" it is such a popular method because they can target young people with whom the site is so popular . "
' make it clear ' chairman of credit action 's board of trustees , malcolm hurlston , said that advertising rules " are there for a reason " .
he added : " they are there to make it clear to people from the beginning what they are letting themselves in for . "
mr hurlston also said some adverts do include the rates of apr but only in the frequently asked questions section , and not prominently on the advert , which is what the rules require .
bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones says the adverts are being placed at a time when it has become harder to borrow from traditional sources .
facebook , along with its main rivals bebo and myspace , lets users set up personal web pages and communicate with each other .
it has an estimated 50 million members worldwide and figures released earlier this year suggest that it has 8.5 million uk-based users .
read a selection of your comments on this story : i 'm a facebook user and i think its ridiculous how credit companies can advertise such high rate apr loans on a social network site who 's main audience is teenagers and young adults .
the majority are students who have a poor credit rating anyway , they 're like vultures waiting for vulnerable young adults , these kind of credit companies do more harm than good , instead of helping improve credit situations , in most cases , they make it worse .
if someone has a poor credit rating it is because they can not control their own spending , so by giving them more money it 's a disaster waiting to happen pally , wolverhampton i saw an advert for payday uk and attempted to go through their application form .
once i had completed all of the required fields it asked me to enter an authorisation code that was sent by sms .
this code did not arrive and when i queried this with the helpline i got the answer that i needed to send a copy of my passport to them despite it being all over the site that no documentation was needed .
at this point i got cold feet and asked them to remove my details as i was not going to complete the process .
to this i was told they are legally oblidged to keep my account details -lrb- bank & debit card -rrb- on file for 6 years .
i am not happy and am trying to ascertain whether this is legal or not .
jon poste , leicester i recently complained to the fsa regarding payday uk , who offer loans at 1355 % apr .
it seems unreal .
on their website they also provide information about what apr means - but this is totally misleading .
they compare borrowing money over a 3 or 5 year period with their charges for one month , and suggest that their rates are cheaper !
the fsa 's response was : " neither the fsa nor the oft can intervene in or investigate complaints against firms on behalf of the public ... to make a complaint against the firm you should complain to the firm ... "
i am sure that the firm , payday uk , are fully aware that they are targeting young people who have no knowledge or understanding of finances .
i am also sure that the firm feels no remorse for preying on the vulnerabilities of their victims .
evidently , all payday uk obviously care about is money .
what then is the point of making a complaint to them , and detailing the above ?
i suspect their response might be something like : " dear damian , thank you for your compliments !
if you would like to arrange a loan with us we would be more than happy to prey on you too ! "
i strongly feel that there should be laws implemented to prevent these kinds of companies operating .
i also feel that facebook should be ashamed of making money by allowing these companies to advertise on their site .
damian , sheffield i think it is wrong , there are so many people preparing to go to uni at this time of year , and they may think , well if i get a loan i will be able to afford it .
its wrong and i feel personally that it is taking advantage of the younger generations .
victoria , grimsby i saw an advert where you can take out a loan as little as £ 70 to bout £ 2000 .
i was tempted to borrow jus £ 100 as i was skint that week and you ca n't really borrow small amounts of money like that anywhere else .
i do n't think it 's a good idea .
i just saw it and wanted it because i could .
charlotte , newport south wales the facebook advertising piece gives only limited space for text for advertisers .
as there is not enough space to meet regulatory requirements in the ads and deliver a marketing message , it makes sense for facebook to refuse ads from the financial services sector .
maybe also they should publish a code of conduct to all other advertisers which includes advertising standards agency guidelines and before facebook publish ads they confirm compliance against these .
ian hendry ian hendry , london , uk i noticed an advert for a ' payday ' loan on facebook , and out of curiosity i clicked on it to find out what it was - i was shocked by how misleading the marketing of the loan was ; it was cleverly done and could easily dupe vulnerable or naive individuals .
the value of the loans is low and it just seems like a completely pointless product , but i was left stunned when i discovered the apr breakdown : a whopping 1380 % .
that 's no typo !
tom , london facebook is responsive to user suggestions and complaints .
i was offended by a particular set of ads for " meet the babe of your dreams " and emailed them ; the ads stopped appearing on my profile within hours .
i am sure that facebook will respond equally well to credit action 's complaint .
this highlights a wider issue over us adverts appearing in a uk context , something the technology should be able to solve if done right .
stuart , staffordshire i find using firefox and adblock you can set it so that you do n't see the ads .
parents could set it up if they wanted so kids did n't see them at all .
john , teesside , uk you should be aware of the fact that not all facebook users are " young people " .
personally , i 'm 54 and quite a lot of my friends of similar age use it to stay in touch .
these ads do n't bother me , they 're just part of the background noise of using the net .
after all , someone has to pay for the upkeep of the system and i 'd rather it was advertisers than me .
steff , yeovil , uk have we lost all power of free will ?

you can click on it , see the interest rate is humongous and close the page - or not click on it at all if you ca n't afford credit , simple as that .
