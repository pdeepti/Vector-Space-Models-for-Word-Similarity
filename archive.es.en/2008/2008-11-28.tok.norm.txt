in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.11.2008 europe rejects patent on embryonic stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of embryonic stem cells for research is a controversial topic in europe the european patent office in munich upheld a decision rejecting a patent on developing human embryonic stem cells .
the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 28.11.2008 eu slams drug makers for delaying or blocking cheaper generics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far more generics are on the market in the us , where aspirin is sold in supermarkets a new eu report accuses drug makers of keeping prices for medication high by thwarting less expensive generic products from coming to market .
in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - lifestyle europe we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.11.2008 media focus on mumbai serves terrorists ' interests , says author großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " certainly , the indian media is hysterical , " nagarkar claims kiran nagarkar , a native of mumbai and author of several novels , including " god 's little soldier , " spoke to dw about terrorism and the media 's role in covering it in the wake of the two-day long siege on his hometown . dw-world.de : you 've spoken in the past about terrorists being labeled as “ primitive ” and the dangers of labeling people that way .
do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .

herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .

he also called on the west to open peace talks with moderate taliban . he confirmed his remarks to deutsche presse-agentur dpa in stuttgart , after a speech he gave wednesday was reported in an area newspaper , the schwaebische zeitung . germany 's efforts to establish a proper police force in afghanistan " have been a failure , " said ammon , whose ksk secrecy-shrouded special forces troops were originally sent to afghanistan to fight the taliban and al qaeda . serving ksk commanders rarely speak in public , let alone bluntly criticize the government . in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said ammon was merely expressing a personal opinion . brigadier-general ammon said that where washington had devoted $ 1 billion -lrb- 776,300 euros -rrb- to developing the army and police , germany had spent just 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- . " it would have taken us another 82 years to obtain a reasonable police force , " he told dpa . he said berlin did too little public outreach to explain to germans the purpose of the military deployment to afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .

do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .

or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .

as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .

in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.11.2008 media focus on mumbai serves terrorists ' interests , says author großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " certainly , the indian media is hysterical , " nagarkar claims kiran nagarkar , a native of mumbai and author of several novels , including " god 's little soldier , " spoke to dw about terrorism and the media 's role in covering it in the wake of the two-day long siege on his hometown . dw-world.de : you 've spoken in the past about terrorists being labeled as “ primitive ” and the dangers of labeling people that way .
do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .
i think of them as human beings and every human being is valuable .
as i say in my book , “ there is only one god and her name is life .
she 's the only one worthy of worship .
all else is irrelevant . ”
i believe this deeply . interview : courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv arabia on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : claudio pizarro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro returned to werder bremen at the beginning of this season .
together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government plane was expected to pick up the men , who work for the clandestine bnd foreign intelligence service , on saturday morning and fly them back home . robert dean , head of the justice department of the united nations administration in kosovo , confirmed that the three had been released . the previous day a panel of kosovo judges had declined to release the three , and asked an international judge to join in a review of the case .
the closed-door hearing lasted nearly 10 hours friday . kosovo police had alleged that the men threw an explosive device at a european union office two weeks ago , but berlin sources said the trio had gone to the scene to investigate the blast .
a previously unknown kosovo organization claimed responsibility this week . in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said a parliamentary official who reviewed the case in berlin on thursday had stated " with remarkable clarity " that the men had nothing to do with the bombing .
steg said it was " a breach of the rule of law " to hold the men . aged 41 to 47 , the three agents were in kosovo posing as advisers to western businesses seeking investment opportunities there .

a government plane was expected to pick up the men , who work for the clandestine bnd foreign intelligence service , on saturday morning and fly them back home . robert dean , head of the justice department of the united nations administration in kosovo , confirmed that the three had been released . the previous day a panel of kosovo judges had declined to release the three , and asked an international judge to join in a review of the case .
the closed-door hearing lasted nearly 10 hours friday . kosovo police had alleged that the men threw an explosive device at a european union office two weeks ago , but berlin sources said the trio had gone to the scene to investigate the blast .
a previously unknown kosovo organization claimed responsibility this week . in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said a parliamentary official who reviewed the case in berlin on thursday had stated " with remarkable clarity " that the men had nothing to do with the bombing .
steg said it was " a breach of the rule of law " to hold the men . aged 41 to 47 , the three agents were in kosovo posing as advisers to western businesses seeking investment opportunities there .

climate change is also on the agenda for next month 's european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit in brussels . long way to go german environment minister sigmar gabriel seized on friday 's data as a sign of the success of berlin 's climate change policy .

" in order to be able to counter climate change we have to make big steps forward .
we still need more efficiency and lower electricity use .

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .
i think of them as human beings and every human being is valuable .
as i say in my book , “ there is only one god and her name is life .
she 's the only one worthy of worship .
all else is irrelevant . ”
i believe this deeply . interview : courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 28.11.2008 eu slams drug makers for delaying or blocking cheaper generics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far more generics are on the market in the us , where aspirin is sold in supermarkets a new eu report accuses drug makers of keeping prices for medication high by thwarting less expensive generic products from coming to market .
in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 28.11.2008 eu slams drug makers for delaying or blocking cheaper generics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far more generics are on the market in the us , where aspirin is sold in supermarkets a new eu report accuses drug makers of keeping prices for medication high by thwarting less expensive generic products from coming to market .
in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.11.2008 europe rejects patent on embryonic stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of embryonic stem cells for research is a controversial topic in europe the european patent office in munich upheld a decision rejecting a patent on developing human embryonic stem cells .
the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .
but that patent , and others related to it held by the wisconsin alumni research foundation , had been challenged . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv arabia on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are prepared so our country can defy the storm , " said economics minister michael glos . low confidence but a steady stream of economic data has underscored how quickly the economic slump was engulfing the nation .
business confidence in germany dropped to its lowest in nearly 16 years in november , a key survey released by the munich-based ifo economic institute said this week . at the same time , economists have been forecasting a rise in unemployment as companies stop hiring or begin laying off workers in the face of the economic slowdown . berlin 's forecast for a feeble 0.2 percent growth rate next year is somewhat optimistic compared to the projections by private economists . many economists believe that german economic growth will contract next year after the nation tipped into a recession during the third quarter this year . a decline in tax revenue as a result of a contraction in economic activity as well as the government 's decision to shelve privatizations including the planned partial sell off of the nation 's railway company , deutsche bahn ag are also playing havoc with budget planning . as a result , draft budget tax revenue projections have been revised downward sharply by about 4.6 billion euros to 244.1 billion euros . election ahead the prospects of a tough economic year in 2009 comes as the country 's political parties start to gear up for next year 's national election . the government expects the 12 billion-euro-package of stimulus measures agreed to by merkel 's cabinet this month to result in a bigger 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment .
the package includes steps to encourage investment in energy-efficient buildings and incentives for car buyers . but berlin argues when previously announced measures such as higher family allowances and tax breaks for children are included , the domestic stimulus package is valued at 32 billion euros . in addition , the bleak economic outlook means merkel 's government will be struggling to meet its target of balancing its budget possibly by 2011 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv arabia on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .

his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .

" we are prepared so our country can defy the storm , " said economics minister michael glos . low confidence but a steady stream of economic data has underscored how quickly the economic slump was engulfing the nation .
business confidence in germany dropped to its lowest in nearly 16 years in november , a key survey released by the munich-based ifo economic institute said this week . at the same time , economists have been forecasting a rise in unemployment as companies stop hiring or begin laying off workers in the face of the economic slowdown . berlin 's forecast for a feeble 0.2 percent growth rate next year is somewhat optimistic compared to the projections by private economists . many economists believe that german economic growth will contract next year after the nation tipped into a recession during the third quarter this year . a decline in tax revenue as a result of a contraction in economic activity as well as the government 's decision to shelve privatizations including the planned partial sell off of the nation 's railway company , deutsche bahn ag are also playing havoc with budget planning . as a result , draft budget tax revenue projections have been revised downward sharply by about 4.6 billion euros to 244.1 billion euros . election ahead the prospects of a tough economic year in 2009 comes as the country 's political parties start to gear up for next year 's national election . the government expects the 12 billion-euro-package of stimulus measures agreed to by merkel 's cabinet this month to result in a bigger 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment .
the package includes steps to encourage investment in energy-efficient buildings and incentives for car buyers . but berlin argues when previously announced measures such as higher family allowances and tax breaks for children are included , the domestic stimulus package is valued at 32 billion euros . in addition , the bleak economic outlook means merkel 's government will be struggling to meet its target of balancing its budget possibly by 2011 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . of the seven people on board , two bodies were recovered from part of the wreckage and five are missing .
five french navy ships scoured the area , but were hindered by poor weather conditions .
the rescue workers gave up the search during the night and a perpignan prosecutor told reporters that there was " no hope of finding survivors . "
one witness said he saw the plane dive abruptly plunging into the sea . " i could see it was an airliner because i saw two large engines .
there was no fire , nothing , " said the witness , a local policeman , who spoke to france info radio .
" it was flying straight . then it turned brutally towards the ground .
i said to myself it will never pull out and there was a big spray of water , " he said .
investigation resumes the a320 , a twin-engine single aisle jet that normally seats 150 passengers , had been leased to xl airways , a german charter carrier and the two pilots on board were german .
the french authorities said that the rest of the crew , which included the captain , a flight inspector and engineers , came from new zealand .
in auckland , air new zealand had confirmed that it had leased the a320 to xl airways for the last two years , and that the aircraft was due to be handed back in frankfurt shortly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv latinoamerica on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv latinoamerica on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.11.2008 europe rejects patent on embryonic stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of embryonic stem cells for research is a controversial topic in europe the european patent office in munich upheld a decision rejecting a patent on developing human embryonic stem cells .
the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .
but that patent , and others related to it held by the wisconsin alumni research foundation , had been challenged . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .
a similar decision by nordmilch would mark the extinction of pro cycling in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv latinoamerica on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : claudio pizarro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro returned to werder bremen at the beginning of this season .
together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.11.2008 media focus on mumbai serves terrorists ' interests , says author großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " certainly , the indian media is hysterical , " nagarkar claims kiran nagarkar , a native of mumbai and author of several novels , including " god 's little soldier , " spoke to dw about terrorism and the media 's role in covering it in the wake of the two-day long siege on his hometown . dw-world.de : you 've spoken in the past about terrorists being labeled as “ primitive ” and the dangers of labeling people that way .
do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .

the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?

i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .

it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .
i think of them as human beings and every human being is valuable .
as i say in my book , “ there is only one god and her name is life .
she 's the only one worthy of worship .
all else is irrelevant . ”
i believe this deeply . interview : courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the states are controlled by merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- or their allies , and her control of the bundesrat has been fundamental to her authority since she became chancellor in 2005 .
but several states , where the cdu rules in coalition with smaller parties , abstained friday when the bill was submitted for a vote .
a second resolution , to refer the bill back to a committee of both chambers , also failed .

business confidence in germany dropped to its lowest in nearly 16 years in november , a key survey released by the munich-based ifo economic institute said this week . at the same time , economists have been forecasting a rise in unemployment as companies stop hiring or begin laying off workers in the face of the economic slowdown . berlin 's forecast for a feeble 0.2 percent growth rate next year is somewhat optimistic compared to the projections by private economists . many economists believe that german economic growth will contract next year after the nation tipped into a recession during the third quarter this year . a decline in tax revenue as a result of a contraction in economic activity as well as the government 's decision to shelve privatizations including the planned partial sell off of the nation 's railway company , deutsche bahn ag are also playing havoc with budget planning . as a result , draft budget tax revenue projections have been revised downward sharply by about 4.6 billion euros to 244.1 billion euros . election ahead the prospects of a tough economic year in 2009 comes as the country 's political parties start to gear up for next year 's national election . the government expects the 12 billion-euro-package of stimulus measures agreed to by merkel 's cabinet this month to result in a bigger 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment .
the package includes steps to encourage investment in energy-efficient buildings and incentives for car buyers . but berlin argues when previously announced measures such as higher family allowances and tax breaks for children are included , the domestic stimulus package is valued at 32 billion euros . in addition , the bleak economic outlook means merkel 's government will be struggling to meet its target of balancing its budget possibly by 2011 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cambodian women ’ s rights activist somaly mam has received the roland berger human dignity award , a human rights award in berlin , germany .
herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .

they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .
he said that while globalisation had made it possible for many people to free themselves from poverty , it had also brought to light the distress of people in other parts of the world , and also new forms of human degradation . ‘ ’ we must now work for a better globalisation .
a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .

herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .
mam dedicated the award to the victims in the shelter , who she said inspire her and give her all the love that she missed when she was young . ‘ ’ these girls are five , six , seven years old .
they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .

a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .
entrepreneur roland berger , who instituted the award , said that unsung heroes like mam need unrestricted support from society .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 28.11.2008 eu slams drug makers for delaying or blocking cheaper generics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far more generics are on the market in the us , where aspirin is sold in supermarkets a new eu report accuses drug makers of keeping prices for medication high by thwarting less expensive generic products from coming to market .
in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .
a similar decision by nordmilch would mark the extinction of pro cycling in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

" we are prepared so our country can defy the storm , " said economics minister michael glos . low confidence but a steady stream of economic data has underscored how quickly the economic slump was engulfing the nation .
business confidence in germany dropped to its lowest in nearly 16 years in november , a key survey released by the munich-based ifo economic institute said this week . at the same time , economists have been forecasting a rise in unemployment as companies stop hiring or begin laying off workers in the face of the economic slowdown . berlin 's forecast for a feeble 0.2 percent growth rate next year is somewhat optimistic compared to the projections by private economists . many economists believe that german economic growth will contract next year after the nation tipped into a recession during the third quarter this year . a decline in tax revenue as a result of a contraction in economic activity as well as the government 's decision to shelve privatizations including the planned partial sell off of the nation 's railway company , deutsche bahn ag are also playing havoc with budget planning . as a result , draft budget tax revenue projections have been revised downward sharply by about 4.6 billion euros to 244.1 billion euros . election ahead the prospects of a tough economic year in 2009 comes as the country 's political parties start to gear up for next year 's national election . the government expects the 12 billion-euro-package of stimulus measures agreed to by merkel 's cabinet this month to result in a bigger 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment .
the package includes steps to encourage investment in energy-efficient buildings and incentives for car buyers . but berlin argues when previously announced measures such as higher family allowances and tax breaks for children are included , the domestic stimulus package is valued at 32 billion euros . in addition , the bleak economic outlook means merkel 's government will be struggling to meet its target of balancing its budget possibly by 2011 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?

i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.11.2008 europe rejects patent on embryonic stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of embryonic stem cells for research is a controversial topic in europe the european patent office in munich upheld a decision rejecting a patent on developing human embryonic stem cells .
the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .
but that patent , and others related to it held by the wisconsin alumni research foundation , had been challenged . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asien on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .

a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .

changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .
mam dedicated the award to the victims in the shelter , who she said inspire her and give her all the love that she missed when she was young . ‘ ’ these girls are five , six , seven years old .
they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .
he said that while globalisation had made it possible for many people to free themselves from poverty , it had also brought to light the distress of people in other parts of the world , and also new forms of human degradation . ‘ ’ we must now work for a better globalisation .
a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .
entrepreneur roland berger , who instituted the award , said that unsung heroes like mam need unrestricted support from society .
the roland berger foundation focuses on the issues of slavery and human trafficking , and also provides support to socially disadvantaged youth . dw staff 28/11/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 january asia quiz quiz of the month north korea us envoy stephen bosworth is hopeful six-nation talks can resume soon .

cambodian women ’ s rights activist somaly mam has received the roland berger human dignity award , a human rights award in berlin , germany .
herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .

they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .
he said that while globalisation had made it possible for many people to free themselves from poverty , it had also brought to light the distress of people in other parts of the world , and also new forms of human degradation . ‘ ’ we must now work for a better globalisation .
a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .

herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .
mam dedicated the award to the victims in the shelter , who she said inspire her and give her all the love that she missed when she was young . ‘ ’ these girls are five , six , seven years old .
they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .
he said that while globalisation had made it possible for many people to free themselves from poverty , it had also brought to light the distress of people in other parts of the world , and also new forms of human degradation . ‘ ’ we must now work for a better globalisation .
a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .
entrepreneur roland berger , who instituted the award , said that unsung heroes like mam need unrestricted support from society .

cambodian women ’ s rights activist somaly mam has received the roland berger human dignity award , a human rights award in berlin , germany .
herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .
mam dedicated the award to the victims in the shelter , who she said inspire her and give her all the love that she missed when she was young . ‘ ’ these girls are five , six , seven years old .
they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .
he said that while globalisation had made it possible for many people to free themselves from poverty , it had also brought to light the distress of people in other parts of the world , and also new forms of human degradation . ‘ ’ we must now work for a better globalisation .
a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .
entrepreneur roland berger , who instituted the award , said that unsung heroes like mam need unrestricted support from society .

cambodian women ’ s rights activist somaly mam has received the roland berger human dignity award , a human rights award in berlin , germany .
herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .
do you know what dignity means for us ?
when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .
changing lives of others today , through her ngo " acting for women in distressing situations " , mam helps other women like her .
the ngo runs shelters and rehabilitation centres for prostitutes , caring for them and providing them with an alternative education .
today , her beneficiaries are not only in cambodia , but in other countries like thailand , vietnam and laos .
mam dedicated the award to the victims in the shelter , who she said inspire her and give her all the love that she missed when she was young . ‘ ’ these girls are five , six , seven years old .
they have been raped , some of them have hiv / aids . but they stand up and go to school , take their pills , three times a day .
they are so strong , ‘ ’ she said .
the award has brought a stronger focus not only on mam ’ s extraordinary journey from a victim to an active social worker , but also on the issue of human trafficking in today ’ s society .
human trafficking needs more attention speaking at the award ceremony , german president horst köhler said that abject poverty forced many women into prostitution and prevented them from living a life of dignity .
he said that while globalisation had made it possible for many people to free themselves from poverty , it had also brought to light the distress of people in other parts of the world , and also new forms of human degradation . ‘ ’ we must now work for a better globalisation .
a globalisation that is for the benefit of all , " said köhler .
entrepreneur roland berger , who instituted the award , said that unsung heroes like mam need unrestricted support from society .
the roland berger foundation focuses on the issues of slavery and human trafficking , and also provides support to socially disadvantaged youth . dw staff 28/11/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 reader response feedback our readers and asia compact listeners love to send in their views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv north america on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .

his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv north america on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

climate change is also on the agenda for next month 's european union -lrb- eu -rrb- leaders ' summit in brussels . long way to go german environment minister sigmar gabriel seized on friday 's data as a sign of the success of berlin 's climate change policy .

" in order to be able to counter climate change we have to make big steps forward .
we still need more efficiency and lower electricity use .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .

"
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .

most of the states are controlled by merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- or their allies , and her control of the bundesrat has been fundamental to her authority since she became chancellor in 2005 .
but several states , where the cdu rules in coalition with smaller parties , abstained friday when the bill was submitted for a vote .
a second resolution , to refer the bill back to a committee of both chambers , also failed .
using trojan software to spy online the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations , or bka , bill that was rejected would have given german investigators the power to break into personal computers during preventative inquiries into terrorism and other serious crimes and allow clandestine observation on their suspects using video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties .

critics claimed the bill would impinge on the vow of silence by journalists , lawyers and doctors .
civil liberties groups also objected .
in order to pass the bill before the new year , the federal cabinet will call on the mediation committee to meet in the coming weeks to discuss a possible compromise . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .
many thanks for the interview .

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .
a similar decision by nordmilch would mark the extinction of pro cycling in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government plane was expected to pick up the men , who work for the clandestine bnd foreign intelligence service , on saturday morning and fly them back home . robert dean , head of the justice department of the united nations administration in kosovo , confirmed that the three had been released . the previous day a panel of kosovo judges had declined to release the three , and asked an international judge to join in a review of the case .
the closed-door hearing lasted nearly 10 hours friday . kosovo police had alleged that the men threw an explosive device at a european union office two weeks ago , but berlin sources said the trio had gone to the scene to investigate the blast .
a previously unknown kosovo organization claimed responsibility this week . in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said a parliamentary official who reviewed the case in berlin on thursday had stated " with remarkable clarity " that the men had nothing to do with the bombing .
steg said it was " a breach of the rule of law " to hold the men . aged 41 to 47 , the three agents were in kosovo posing as advisers to western businesses seeking investment opportunities there .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 28.11.2008 media focus on mumbai serves terrorists ' interests , says author großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " certainly , the indian media is hysterical , " nagarkar claims kiran nagarkar , a native of mumbai and author of several novels , including " god 's little soldier , " spoke to dw about terrorism and the media 's role in covering it in the wake of the two-day long siege on his hometown . dw-world.de : you 've spoken in the past about terrorists being labeled as “ primitive ” and the dangers of labeling people that way .
do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .
i think of them as human beings and every human being is valuable .
as i say in my book , “ there is only one god and her name is life .
she 's the only one worthy of worship .
all else is irrelevant . ”
i believe this deeply . interview : courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?

yes , the media has to cover these events .

where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .
i think of them as human beings and every human being is valuable .
as i say in my book , “ there is only one god and her name is life .
she 's the only one worthy of worship .
all else is irrelevant . ”

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : claudio pizarro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro returned to werder bremen at the beginning of this season .
together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .
many thanks for the interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : claudio pizarro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudio pizarro returned to werder bremen at the beginning of this season .
together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

a government plane was expected to pick up the men , who work for the clandestine bnd foreign intelligence service , on saturday morning and fly them back home . robert dean , head of the justice department of the united nations administration in kosovo , confirmed that the three had been released . the previous day a panel of kosovo judges had declined to release the three , and asked an international judge to join in a review of the case .
the closed-door hearing lasted nearly 10 hours friday . kosovo police had alleged that the men threw an explosive device at a european union office two weeks ago , but berlin sources said the trio had gone to the scene to investigate the blast .
a previously unknown kosovo organization claimed responsibility this week . in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said a parliamentary official who reviewed the case in berlin on thursday had stated " with remarkable clarity " that the men had nothing to do with the bombing .
steg said it was " a breach of the rule of law " to hold the men . aged 41 to 47 , the three agents were in kosovo posing as advisers to western businesses seeking investment opportunities there .

a government plane was expected to pick up the men , who work for the clandestine bnd foreign intelligence service , on saturday morning and fly them back home . robert dean , head of the justice department of the united nations administration in kosovo , confirmed that the three had been released . the previous day a panel of kosovo judges had declined to release the three , and asked an international judge to join in a review of the case .
the closed-door hearing lasted nearly 10 hours friday . kosovo police had alleged that the men threw an explosive device at a european union office two weeks ago , but berlin sources said the trio had gone to the scene to investigate the blast .
a previously unknown kosovo organization claimed responsibility this week . in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said a parliamentary official who reviewed the case in berlin on thursday had stated " with remarkable clarity " that the men had nothing to do with the bombing .
steg said it was " a breach of the rule of law " to hold the men . aged 41 to 47 , the three agents were in kosovo posing as advisers to western businesses seeking investment opportunities there .

most of the states are controlled by merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- or their allies , and her control of the bundesrat has been fundamental to her authority since she became chancellor in 2005 .
but several states , where the cdu rules in coalition with smaller parties , abstained friday when the bill was submitted for a vote .
a second resolution , to refer the bill back to a committee of both chambers , also failed .
using trojan software to spy online the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations , or bka , bill that was rejected would have given german investigators the power to break into personal computers during preventative inquiries into terrorism and other serious crimes and allow clandestine observation on their suspects using video surveillance , bugging telephones , searching homes , and even requesting data from third parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privacy is a big issue in the country due to its recent past police have likewise been studying whether they could either enter premises to plant monitoring devices in computers or send viruses using trojan software to the computers via the internet so that investigators could covertly read the hard disks .
critics claimed the bill would impinge on the vow of silence by journalists , lawyers and doctors .
civil liberties groups also objected .

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagarkar 's book " god 's little soldier " traces the development of a terrorist in india it 's not the last two days , it 's much earlier than that .
i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .
a similar decision by nordmilch would mark the extinction of pro cycling in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .
t-mobile ended its engagement last year over massive doping at the team and gerolsteiner 's engagement ends at the end of the year .
a similar decision by nordmilch would mark the extinction of pro cycling in germany . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 28.11.2008 eu slams drug makers for delaying or blocking cheaper generics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far more generics are on the market in the us , where aspirin is sold in supermarkets a new eu report accuses drug makers of keeping prices for medication high by thwarting less expensive generic products from coming to market .
in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .
" where there is a strong commercial incentive , generics enter the market rapidly within four months or less , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . of the seven people on board , two bodies were recovered from part of the wreckage and five are missing .
five french navy ships scoured the area , but were hindered by poor weather conditions .
the rescue workers gave up the search during the night and a perpignan prosecutor told reporters that there was " no hope of finding survivors . "
one witness said he saw the plane dive abruptly plunging into the sea . " i could see it was an airliner because i saw two large engines .
there was no fire , nothing , " said the witness , a local policeman , who spoke to france info radio .
" it was flying straight . then it turned brutally towards the ground .
i said to myself it will never pull out and there was a big spray of water , " he said .
investigation resumes the a320 , a twin-engine single aisle jet that normally seats 150 passengers , had been leased to xl airways , a german charter carrier and the two pilots on board were german .
the french authorities said that the rest of the crew , which included the captain , a flight inspector and engineers , came from new zealand .
in auckland , air new zealand had confirmed that it had leased the a320 to xl airways for the last two years , and that the aircraft was due to be handed back in frankfurt shortly .
the jet was being serviced at eas industries in perpignan and had been circling the air for 90 minutes before crashing , according to an emergency services spokesman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv europa on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.11.2008 europe rejects patent on embryonic stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of embryonic stem cells for research is a controversial topic in europe the european patent office in munich upheld a decision rejecting a patent on developing human embryonic stem cells .
the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .
university of wisconsin researcher james thomson was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1988 , a discovery which was later patented .
but that patent , and others related to it held by the wisconsin alumni research foundation , had been challenged . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government plane was expected to pick up the men , who work for the clandestine bnd foreign intelligence service , on saturday morning and fly them back home . robert dean , head of the justice department of the united nations administration in kosovo , confirmed that the three had been released . the previous day a panel of kosovo judges had declined to release the three , and asked an international judge to join in a review of the case .
the closed-door hearing lasted nearly 10 hours friday . kosovo police had alleged that the men threw an explosive device at a european union office two weeks ago , but berlin sources said the trio had gone to the scene to investigate the blast .
a previously unknown kosovo organization claimed responsibility this week . in berlin , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said a parliamentary official who reviewed the case in berlin on thursday had stated " with remarkable clarity " that the men had nothing to do with the bombing .
steg said it was " a breach of the rule of law " to hold the men . aged 41 to 47 , the three agents were in kosovo posing as advisers to western businesses seeking investment opportunities there .

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

together with ailton he brought latino flair to the club in the north of germany . bremen 's prodigal son is back !
claudio pizarro started his bundesliga career here in 1999 and returned this season having made it big time .
now everyone in bremen is hoping the peruvian international back for good .
kickoff ! took time to speak to him in his mother tongue , spanish .
dw-tv in bremen they welcomed you with open arms as a returning star .
are you treated differently here , in comparison to at bayern or chelsea ?
claudio pizarro generally i 've been well received wherever i 've gone .
but this time it did surprise me a bit .
when i came here in 1999 , i was very young .
in those two years i did n't realise how much the people liked me here .
and then this reception , this affection they showed for me .
that 's very important for me as a player .
in 1999 the youngster came to bremen , direct from lima , and had immediate success with the northern german club .
paired with the brazilian ailton , pizarro posed a constant danger up front .
in 2001 pizarro moved to bayern munich .
his grew his hair longer but the success remained .
pizarro scored goal after goal after goal .
and in his six years at bayern , he picked up plenty of titles too of course .
why did you leave bayern ?
i had a really great time at bayern munich .
i had a good relationship with the club .
but i left because i could n't reach agreement with management .
my contract had come to an end .
that 's all .
what did you want from bayern ?
i tried to reach a financial agreement with them but it did n't work .
then there were other things which were personal which i do n't want to talk about .
there was some criticism of you that you did n't show enough ambition , that you took things too easy .
no way !
absolutely not !
but i am a latino and for germans that is sometimes hard to understand .
i 'm a bit of a rascal - and i wo n't ever lose that .
in the end , the rascal claudio was surplus to bayern 's needs .
that cheeky trait can be a rare thing in the bundesliga .
not everyone here lacks the instinct - but most of them do .
a german player is very organised .
he 's very unlikely to take the long way round to achieve his aim .
a latino is more flexible in such matters - and that 's what i mean by being a rascal ! + + + is the latin american influence good for german football ?
there 's no doubt about it !
i would never want to criticise german football , the statistics and the results speak for themselves .
german football has always been at the top .
latin america or peru were never at that level .
but that 's why the mix is so important .
not everyone has it here .
one or two players have to be a bit of a rascal in my opinion . + + + good , let 's move on to your time at chelsea .
it was the worst year of your professional career - was there too much pressure ?
no , definitely not .
it was just another experience for me .
jose mourinho , rang me up and said he wanted me in his team .
so i went .
then , unfortunately , three months later he left the club .
you 've played alongside stars like ailton , effenberg , elber , ze roberto , ballack , makaay and drogba .
where did it work best ?
one of my best years was with ailton in bremen .
it was amazing how we understood each other .
maybe because ailton is quite a rascal , too , perhaps ?
with your return to bremen , your career came full circle .
today , like back in 1999 , thomas schaaf is coach and klaus allofs is the commercial manager .
that 's why i decided to come back here .
i knew klaus , i knew thomas .
i know them and they know me .
that played a very important role in my return .
and it 's like he never went away .
with seven goals to his name , he 's the team 's best striker .
at the ripe of age of 30 , claudio is reaching his peak .
time to take on a leadership role ?
are you a leader on the pitch ?
i think so .
with my experience and my skills i think i am a leader in the team . + + + what characteristics should a leader have ?
he should show his skill on the pitch - every time he runs out .
he should serve the team .
steer the team , but also support it .
he has his own point of view .
the team must get the feeling that he is on their side .
can you name any examples of such a player ?
a player with leadership qualities ?
john terry .
he 's 27 , or maybe 28 .
at any rate he can lead his team well .
he 's at home in the role of captain .
and he pushes his team forward .
you are now at bremen , but your contract with chelsea runs til 2011 .
can you imagine staying here longer ?
it 's s a possibility - of course .
i wo n't rule anything out .
it 's too early to say what i will do .
but staying at bremen is possible .
would winning the league influence your decision ?
perhaps .
i think that could play a role .

" we can confirm that we are checking our engagement , " said a nordmilch spokeswoman from the dairy products company headquarters in bremen , germany .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on thursday that nordmilch lawyers are looking into whether the company can get out of the contract with team boss gerry van gerwen which is valid until 2010 .
van gerwen did not want to comment on the report , referring to a december meeting with nordmilch , but said he had a valid contract until 2010 .
nordmilch is spending an estimated 9 million euros -lrb- $ 11.7 million -rrb- per year on the team .
but the constant doping debate and the withdrawal of german state networks ard and zdf from broadcasting the 2009 tour de france have led to second thoughts over the engagement .
nordmilch has been in cycling since 2006 and linus gerdemann was recently named new team captain .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

in the us , far more generic drugs are sold than in europe . drug companies are blocking or delaying the entry of cheaper generic medicines from coming to the market , according to an eu report released on friday , nov .
28 .
" the commission will not hesitate to open anti-trust cases against companies where there are indications that the anti-trust rules may have been breached , " said neelie kroes , the 27-nation bloc 's competition commissioner .
the report examined a sampling of medication from 17 european union member states in which the patents have expired and estimated that the delays involved in getting generic versions of those brand names on the market had cost health care providers around three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- between 2000 and 2007 .
the results of the sample probe prompted kroes to comment that competition in the pharmaceutical industry was not functioning as well as it should .
drug companies say eu report is exaggerated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu competition chief kroes has mandate to impose hefty fines on anti-trust violators drug companies invest enormous sums in research and development and , when they emerge with a breakthrough drug , patents enable them to recoup costs by giving them a monopoly on selling their brand product at a premium .
when the patent expires , copy-cat manufacturers are then legally able to offer the same no-name drug at considerably lower prices .
kroes added that practices that involve multiple patent applications for similar drugs , litigation and settlement deals also contributed to delays in getting generics on the market .
pharmaceutical companies said that the report exaggerated the length of generic delays and failed to take into account the complexity of the market .
hefty fines for breaching competition rules the attack from the commission , which is the eu 's executive arm , puts even more pressure on a beleaguered global industry that faces loss of patent protection on some of its biggest selling products over the next four years .
european drug companies also face major challenges in the united states , where president-elect barack obama is expected to seek ways to trim costs as he tries to extend universal healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans .
kroes has the mandate to impose substantial fines on drug makers deemed to have engaged in unfair competition practices .
back in 2005 , britain 's astrazeneca was fined 60 million euros for blocking generic rivals from bringing its heartburn and ulcer medication losec onto the market .
raids on big-name drug makers in january this year , kroes started launching an investigation with a number of raids on some of the biggest names in the pharmaceutical industry , such as glaxosmithkline , pfizer , merck and sanofi-aventis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aspirin has become the most generic medicine ever the commission said it had found documents containing admissions from brand-name companies that they had tried to stop generics .
the documents were also said to include many examples of obstacles placed in way of generic rivals .
in one case , a whopping 1,300 patents were filed for a single medication , the commission said .
there were also nearly 700 cases of patent litigation that lasted for three years on average , in which generic firms mostly prevailed .
more generic competition in us compared to the united states , where generic drugs account for most of the market , the sale of less expensive no-name brands in europe accounts for little more than 40 percent of the overall volume .
the big pharmaceutical companies insist that competition is alive and well in the industry and argue that they are hampered by too much regulation from brussels .
arthur higgins , ceo of bayer healthcare and president of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations told reuters news agency that the report overstated the extent and reasons for delays in generics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.11.2008 europe rejects patent on embryonic stem cells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of embryonic stem cells for research is a controversial topic in europe the european patent office in munich upheld a decision rejecting a patent on developing human embryonic stem cells .
the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .
an " ethical victory " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say stem cells are an important avenue for finding cures for chronic diseases bavarian justice minister beate merk from the conservative christian democratic union declared the ruling an " ethical victory . "
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .
without patent protection , companies looking to profit from technology using stem cells have little incentive to pour money into research .

the move could stifle research by stem-cell companies for commercial purposes . the initial decision , made in june , ruled against a patent application filed in 1995 by the wisconsin alumni research foundation regarding the use of embryonic stem cells .
" european patent law prohibits the patenting of human stem cell cultures whose preparation necessarily involves the destruction of human embryos , " the european patent office said in a statement on thursday , nov .
27 .
these stem cell cultures , taken from days-old embryos , work as a type of master cell for the body and are capable of changing into many different types of tissues and cells .
advocates say it is an important route to explore for potential cures for conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal cord injuries .
opponents call the research unethical because it requires the destruction of the embryo .

"
the decision made it clear that the patent office does have an ethical boundary , she told the german news service tagesschau .
the environmental organization greenpeace likewise praised the ruling as a milestone : " without public interference , such patents would long be accepted . "
in the us , companies like geron corp have been granted patents on certain types of human embryonic stem cell growth technology .
the board 's decision to uphold the earlier ruling could keep some companies from jumping into the sector here and steer investors to put their money elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asia + on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .

how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asia + on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asia + on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .

do you find your views confirmed by these events ?
whatever thoughts i have , this unfortunately reconfirms what i 've been saying .
as you well know , these guys who were there seem to be high tech .
the planning itself is very meticulous .
they are deeply conscious about doing everything to have the largest possible impact on media .
they are not doing this for any other reason but to get media attention .
i 'm talking about taking the foreigners hostage , attacking a jewish home .
there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .
has the media , then , in some way played into their hands by their reporting of the events over the past two days ?

i completely understand that there is no getting away from media attention but this hysterical media attention i find very dubious .
yes , the media has to cover these events .
but there has to be some discrimination .
where are the calm voices ?
at some point in time this subject needs to be looked into very seriously - the question of , is it only alienation ?
is it the fact that they have serious grievances that is making them do these things ?
or is it that now it 's their moment of glory ?
not just in front of allah but in front of a damned tv screen .
i think this is something that 's been overlooked to a great extent .
do you think the accusations of involvement being leveled at pakistan could create greater division between muslims and other religious groups in india and between india and pakistan ?
that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .
or it is no reflection on the muslims in pakistan either .
when we make such statements , even with the full proof behind us , let us also make amply clear that there is no accusation against muslims as such at all .
when we speak of india , we are speaking of hindus , muslims , christians , parsis , and sikhs together .
we are all affected … .
are you trying to say that the muslims themselves in bombay are not affected by this ?
as much as the hindus .
nobody 's rejoicing .
maybe some awful fanatics might be rejoicing .
in your book " god 's little soldier , " which traces the development of a religious fundamentalist who turns to terrorism , you also describe the issues of class and wealth that many indians face , what with such a huge gap in mumbai between rich and poor .
these attacks , as we see , took place in a very wealthy part of the city .
do you think issues of class have played a major role in these attacks ?
insofar as it gains far higher visibility for the terrorists , yes of course .
they singled out many locations but this time , there were two of the most affluent , rather expensive hotels in india .
the taj mahal is of course a landmark .
so they knew exactly what they were doing .
they were very smart , if you think of their objectives .
it says something awful about the indian governance , the indian police that we did not have any contingency plans , but the terrorists knew what they were doing .
they 've had bombings all over the country before that have attracted publicity , but never the kind of international attention that they 're getting now .
do n't forget , even in death , there are priorities .
it 's appalling that all these people died and are injured or are suffering so terribly .
i hope to god never again will our people let foreigners ever suffer like this .
but i hope to god also , simultaneously , never again will my government or my police or my countrymen allow my own countrymen to suffer like this .
i mean that we will take care of each other .
i do not think of people as foreigners or indians .

there is such a tiny population of jewish people in bombay -lrb- officially called mumbai -rrb- and it is truly tragic that those few jewish people are being attacked also .
but let 's talk about the terrorists who have come this time .
it 's not your madrassa guy - yes , the madrassa s have been the birthplace of many terrorists , and of that kind of thinking .
but a lot of other muslims have been alienated because of the world 's stance on issues like palestine , on issues like kashmir .
and i think there is now a tremendous attraction that these people feel because of the media attention .
i think they want this media attention and that is why they are escalating their violence .

that question has to be handled very carefully .
on the one hand , i think it is extremely premature … nobody seems to have any concrete proof .
it is entirely wrong on the part of anybody within india to make such allegations .
on the other hand , if in 10 days or 10 months from now , if it transpired that there is genuine proof that it was pakistan who were behind this , then we have to come out and say that this might be the case .
at the same time , we have to make sure that it is absolutely noted that it is no reflection on muslims in india .

he also called on the west to open peace talks with moderate taliban . he confirmed his remarks to deutsche presse-agentur dpa in stuttgart , after a speech he gave wednesday was reported in an area newspaper , the schwaebische zeitung . germany 's efforts to establish a proper police force in afghanistan " have been a failure , " said ammon , whose ksk secrecy-shrouded special forces troops were originally sent to afghanistan to fight the taliban and al qaeda . serving ksk commanders rarely speak in public , let alone bluntly criticize the government . in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said ammon was merely expressing a personal opinion . brigadier-general ammon said that where washington had devoted $ 1 billion -lrb- 776,300 euros -rrb- to developing the army and police , germany had spent just 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- . " it would have taken us another 82 years to obtain a reasonable police force , " he told dpa . he said berlin did too little public outreach to explain to germans the purpose of the military deployment to afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asia + on the spot -pipe- 28.11.2008 on the spot : armin veh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin veh was released from his job at vfb stuttgart after over 1000 days and winning the championship in the 2006/2007 season . armin veh , 47 years old , and stuttgart coach for more than 1,000 days .
his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .
but this year 's results have been modest - stuttgart is 11th in the table .
and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .
in particular in the last two years , ever since i 've been in charge , i let my people do things .
that means i 'm less drained and i 'm free to keep an eye on what 's going on .
armin veh 's coaching career began in augsburg .
he was 29 when he took on the job .
in 2002 he started coaching in the bundesliga - with hansa rostock .
four years later veh was the surprise new coach of stuttgart .
in 2007 he was voted coach of the year .
how do you relax ?
for me it 's always hard to switch off after a match - whether it 's a defeat , a draw or a win .
i can never sleep .
everything keeps running through my head .
it 's still that way even at my age - i can never completely turn off .
i just ca n't .
before a game i sleep fine .
but afterwards i keep going over everything in my mind .
and then you talk it over with your dog , yeah ?
yes .
you may not believe it , but you can really talk to him .
i can believe it .
horst hrubesch told us he talks with his horses .
of course .
i 'm sure there are many , many animals who could say a lot about the family they live with .
i 'm convinced of it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his best season so far was the 2006/2007 championship year .

and veh 's players have seriously underperformed in their last four matches .
dw-tv : what 's going on at the moment ?
what 's not working ?
can you say ?
armin veh : the effortless style that we had for nearly two years - we seem to have lost it at the moment .
we 're having trouble asserting ourselves .
we 're not moving like we should , in some cases we 're not willing to move enough .
but that 's absolutely essential for our game .
so when we come up against a strongly defensive side , we 've got problems .
and we give away points .
take the cologne match - we were counting on getting three points - or bielefeld .
otherwise we 'd be ok in the table .
with 23 points we 'd be fifth i think , hypothetically - those five lost points are sorely missed .
does n't that effortless style get lost when there 's a lot of pressure from outside ?
for example , are hoffenheim doing so well because they 're not under pressure ?
it 's very simple .
the year we won the championship we had our youngest team , and we had no european competitions .
we had that carefree style - you could see it in our game .
hoffenheim remind me a bit of that time when we were playing .
it 's natural for that to get lost , but we have to find it again .
now we have lots of national players and we play internationally too where there 's more pressure .
the expectations are higher .
so some of that carefree style will disappear because you have something to lose .
what we have to ask ourselves is ' how do we get back there ? '
it 's not easy .
you ca n't just push a button - ultimately it 's a process .
the old stuttgart from their championship year has made an appearance a few times this season .
like when stuttgart ran circles around werder bremen .
that was truly fine football .
but the match against cologne was a disaster - nothing seemed to work as stuttgart made one mistake after another .
when things go badly they go really badly .
it 's hard to say why ...
of course we have to find the reasons .
you just have to be careful not to start acting impulsively just because there 's pressure from outside .
that 's fairly normal .
it 's easy to find yourself taking steps that you 're not really committed to - just because there 's this suggestion that you should be taking them .
i do n't let myself be dictated to .
it 's not that i 'm not willing to listen ; there are plenty of interesting viewpoints - sometimes the media has interesting associations or thoughts that we can take on board .
but the decisions are made by me - and my coaching staff .
national player thomas hitzlsperger 's poor form earned him a spell on the bench ...
so far , new defender khalid boulahrouz has n't lived up to expectations .
just like the new midfielder jan simak and what about jens lehmann ?
the ex-national goalkeeper seems to do nothing but complain .
does this make a coach despair ?
a coach is n't the almighty - he ca n't take care of everything .
you and the coaching team have to try to set new accents - maybe make some changes that will move things forward .
can you delegate ?
sure .
i 've been a coach for 18 years and in the first years i did everything myself .
except for the goalkeepers - i never trained them because i 'm not a goalkeeper and i do n't have a feeling for it .
but i did everything else .
i was my own assistant , i was fitness coach , mental trainer ...
i was everything .
that 's the way it was in the early years , but now i 've changed that .

he also called on the west to open peace talks with moderate taliban . he confirmed his remarks to deutsche presse-agentur dpa in stuttgart , after a speech he gave wednesday was reported in an area newspaper , the schwaebische zeitung . germany 's efforts to establish a proper police force in afghanistan " have been a failure , " said ammon , whose ksk secrecy-shrouded special forces troops were originally sent to afghanistan to fight the taliban and al qaeda . serving ksk commanders rarely speak in public , let alone bluntly criticize the government . in berlin , a defense ministry spokesman said ammon was merely expressing a personal opinion . brigadier-general ammon said that where washington had devoted $ 1 billion -lrb- 776,300 euros -rrb- to developing the army and police , germany had spent just 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15 million -rrb- . " it would have taken us another 82 years to obtain a reasonable police force , " he told dpa . he said berlin did too little public outreach to explain to germans the purpose of the military deployment to afghanistan . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.11.2008 german parliament approves 2009 budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel had a reason to smile on friday the german parliament signed off on friday on the nation 's 2009 budget which calls for substantially higher borrowing as the country gears up for a tough economic year and national elections . the budget , which the was agreed to by the lower house of parliament , substantially boosts borrowings to meet government plans for spurring economic growth amid signs that a sharp contraction has taken hold in europe 's biggest economy . the 2009 budget of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government calls for raising new borrowing of 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 23 billion -rrb- , far higher than the 10.5 billion euros which finance minister peer steinbrueck had forecast at mid-year . but since then the world financial crisis has pushed the global economy into a dramatic downturn , forcing berlin to join other governments around the world in unveiling a stimulus package aimed at underpinning economic growth . the government has also unveiled a 500-billion-euro rescue plan to help the nation 's financial sector limp through the current upheaval . berlin is also under pressure from the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- to contribute to a planned massive 130-billion-euro package aimed at helping to fire up economic growth in europe .

" we are prepared so our country can defy the storm , " said economics minister michael glos . low confidence but a steady stream of economic data has underscored how quickly the economic slump was engulfing the nation .
business confidence in germany dropped to its lowest in nearly 16 years in november , a key survey released by the munich-based ifo economic institute said this week . at the same time , economists have been forecasting a rise in unemployment as companies stop hiring or begin laying off workers in the face of the economic slowdown . berlin 's forecast for a feeble 0.2 percent growth rate next year is somewhat optimistic compared to the projections by private economists . many economists believe that german economic growth will contract next year after the nation tipped into a recession during the third quarter this year . a decline in tax revenue as a result of a contraction in economic activity as well as the government 's decision to shelve privatizations including the planned partial sell off of the nation 's railway company , deutsche bahn ag are also playing havoc with budget planning . as a result , draft budget tax revenue projections have been revised downward sharply by about 4.6 billion euros to 244.1 billion euros . election ahead the prospects of a tough economic year in 2009 comes as the country 's political parties start to gear up for next year 's national election . the government expects the 12 billion-euro-package of stimulus measures agreed to by merkel 's cabinet this month to result in a bigger 50-billion-euro boost to consumption and investment .
the package includes steps to encourage investment in energy-efficient buildings and incentives for car buyers . but berlin argues when previously announced measures such as higher family allowances and tax breaks for children are included , the domestic stimulus package is valued at 32 billion euros . in addition , the bleak economic outlook means merkel 's government will be struggling to meet its target of balancing its budget possibly by 2011 . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

herself a former victim of prostitution , somaly mam has been fighting against forced prostitution for over 12 years . somaly mam was presented the roland berger human dignity award at a ceremony in berlin this week .
as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .

when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .
people sold me because i was dark-skinned , ’ ’ said mam , her voice choked with tears .
mam worked as a domestic slave to an unknown older man at the age of ten , and was sold to a brothel a few years later .
there she was subjected to violence , abuse , and malnutrition , until she met a frenchman named pierre lagros who helped her escape from the brothel .

as she stepped up on stage to receive the award from german president horst köhler , she was visibly moved .
troubled childhood ‘ ’ when i got the call one morning telling me that i have received the human dignity award , i went to the -lrb- ngo ’ s -rrb- shelter and told the girls that we have received a word , it is called dignity .

when i was born , i did not know my mother , i did not know my parents .
i didn ’ t even know if somaly was my real name .

27 . of the seven people on board , two bodies were recovered from part of the wreckage and five are missing .
five french navy ships scoured the area , but were hindered by poor weather conditions .
the rescue workers gave up the search during the night and a perpignan prosecutor told reporters that there was " no hope of finding survivors . "
one witness said he saw the plane dive abruptly plunging into the sea . " i could see it was an airliner because i saw two large engines .
there was no fire , nothing , " said the witness , a local policeman , who spoke to france info radio .
" it was flying straight . then it turned brutally towards the ground .
i said to myself it will never pull out and there was a big spray of water , " he said .
investigation resumes the a320 , a twin-engine single aisle jet that normally seats 150 passengers , had been leased to xl airways , a german charter carrier and the two pilots on board were german .
the french authorities said that the rest of the crew , which included the captain , a flight inspector and engineers , came from new zealand .
in auckland , air new zealand had confirmed that it had leased the a320 to xl airways for the last two years , and that the aircraft was due to be handed back in frankfurt shortly .
the jet was being serviced at eas industries in perpignan and had been circling the air for 90 minutes before crashing , according to an emergency services spokesman .
airbus said the a320 had logged 7,000 hours of flight time since it was built in 2005 .
accidents during the servicing of a plane are rare .
the last time a test flight crashed was a year ago toulouse-blagnac airport , causing some serious injuries .

set up for a one-year trial on the fourth floor of a walk-in centre , it 's the first nhs clinic for gambling addicts .
supporters say this initiative is long overdue .
rob , a 50-year-old recovering addict helped by gamblers anonymous , said : " any form of therapy or clinic - especially for young people - could save lives , or even give them a quality of life . "
for rob , his path to gambling all started as a boy in belfast , with errands to the bookies for his brothers .
then there were roulette machines , pitch and toss in the street , cards and visits to the greyhounds four or five times a week .
' illness of want ' " it progressed in a way that anything i had , i had to gamble .
and i actually stole things in order to fuel my gambling .
i 'm not proud of that but that 's the way it was . "
rob says through gambling he became " embedded in his own hell " .
he was unable to communicate , to have relationships , or to do his work because of his consuming obsession .
he said : " it 's the illness of want .
i want it and i want it now .
gambling paints a pretty picture like a holiday in the bahamas whereby you can have these things .
" it 's like a pied piper coercing you in .
and that appeals to young people . "
the walk-in clinic is being run in soho for a one year trial for years rob was fixated with winning back his losses .
he thought he had a financial problem , not an illness .
but , through his involvement with gamblers anonymous , he developed a better understanding of his condition .
the lead consultant psychiatrist at the new nhs gambling clinic , dr henrietta bowden-jones , said that across society perceptions of gambling are changing .
she said : " people are beginning to realise that it 's a serious illness that can cause people to become suicidal , that can lead people to lose their homes , to lose the relationships they most care about , and in many cases leads people who are extremely moral people to commit illegal acts to fund their addiction . "
' training colleagues ' the clinic helps people with extreme gambling problems , who may be referred on by counselling services or their gp , or they may refer themselves .
there 's an initial hour-and-a-half psychiatric assessment with dr bowden-jones .
then there are 12 weeks of one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy , another 12 weeks of group therapy , plus help for depression and anxiety , support for families and advice on managing debts .
it 's thought there are about 300,000 problem gamblers across the uk .
dr bowden-jones hopes this clinic is just the start of a much wider service .
" my dream in the future would be to have other nhs centres set up throughout the country .
and i 've been training colleagues , psychiatrists in the subject , in the hope that people will be interested and want to pick it up . "
this is something the british medical association also wants to see .
last year it published a report spelling out the health risks of gambling addiction , warning of the particular threat to young people from fruit machines and online gambling .
the bma 's head of science and ethics , dr vivienne nathanson , said the gambling industry should do much more to pay for the harm caused by addiction .
compulsory levy ?
" i think it 's an interesting question whether the nhs should pay for it and we certainly believe that the levy on the gambling industry which is there to fund good causes , including education about gambling addiction , should be producing more money , and that that money should support many of these clinics . "
the gaming industry supports problem gamblers through voluntary donations to the responsibility in gambling trust .
it has helped to fund the new clinic in soho , and also supports gambling research and education .
the bma has warned of the health risks of gambling addiction , it has agreed a target this year of £ 4.5m with the industry , but donations look set to fall well short .
the government is looking at whether to make the levy compulsory .
the trust 's director , malcolm bruce , said this was no idle threat .
he said : " we 're not confident of reaching our target , but it 's still in the gift of the gambling industry to put that money forward .
" otherwise there will be a levy on the gambling industry and they will be forced to pay for this whole area .
and that would be really unfortunate because some excellent progress has been made over the past seven or eight years in this area . "
the clinic in soho has already seen patients from all over england .
if it proves successful , pressure will grow on the nhs to set up similar clinics across the country , and that will prompt further questions about who foots the bill .

' training colleagues ' the clinic helps people with extreme gambling problems , who may be referred on by counselling services or their gp , or they may refer themselves .
there 's an initial hour-and-a-half psychiatric assessment with dr bowden-jones .
then there are 12 weeks of one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy , another 12 weeks of group therapy , plus help for depression and anxiety , support for families and advice on managing debts .
it 's thought there are about 300,000 problem gamblers across the uk .
dr bowden-jones hopes this clinic is just the start of a much wider service .
" my dream in the future would be to have other nhs centres set up throughout the country .
and i 've been training colleagues , psychiatrists in the subject , in the hope that people will be interested and want to pick it up . "
this is something the british medical association also wants to see .
last year it published a report spelling out the health risks of gambling addiction , warning of the particular threat to young people from fruit machines and online gambling .
the bma 's head of science and ethics , dr vivienne nathanson , said the gambling industry should do much more to pay for the harm caused by addiction .
compulsory levy ?
" i think it 's an interesting question whether the nhs should pay for it and we certainly believe that the levy on the gambling industry which is there to fund good causes , including education about gambling addiction , should be producing more money , and that that money should support many of these clinics . "
the gaming industry supports problem gamblers through voluntary donations to the responsibility in gambling trust .
it has helped to fund the new clinic in soho , and also supports gambling research and education .
the bma has warned of the health risks of gambling addiction , it has agreed a target this year of £ 4.5m with the industry , but donations look set to fall well short .
the government is looking at whether to make the levy compulsory .
the trust 's director , malcolm bruce , said this was no idle threat .
he said : " we 're not confident of reaching our target , but it 's still in the gift of the gambling industry to put that money forward .
" otherwise there will be a levy on the gambling industry and they will be forced to pay for this whole area .
and that would be really unfortunate because some excellent progress has been made over the past seven or eight years in this area . "
the clinic in soho has already seen patients from all over england .
if it proves successful , pressure will grow on the nhs to set up similar clinics across the country , and that will prompt further questions about who foots the bill .

advertisement bbc medical correspondent fergus walsh visits the laboratory that confirms measles cases for the whole of the uk .
measles cases in england and wales have topped 1,000 in a year for the first time in more than a decade , health protection agency figures show .
in the first 10 months of 2008 there were 1,049 cases , more than in the whole of 2007 , the agency said .
it said measles was spreading more easily because of the low uptake of the combined mmr jab over the past decade .
in cheshire , an outbreak of more than 60 cases has prompted the launch of a programme to vaccinate 10,000 pupils .
the decade of relatively low vaccination coverage was triggered by now-debunked research claims of a link between the combined measles , mumps and rubella jab and autism .
yearly measles cases 1996 - 112 cases 1997 - 177 1998 - 56 1999 - 92 2000 - 100 2001 - 70 2002 - 319 2003 - 437 2004 - 188 2005 - 78 2006 - 740 2007 - 990 2008 to october - 1,049 q & a : measles public health experts say the growing number of children who are unprotected - about 3m or one in four have not had both mmr doses - means there is a real risk of an epidemic .
it is estimated this could result in between 30,000 and 100,000 cases of measles in england alone .
although mmr coverage is higher in scotland and northern ireland , experts said an epidemic could affect children anywhere .
dr mary ramsay , an immunisation expert at the health protection agency , said : " over the last few years we have seen an unprecedented increase in measles cases and we are still receiving reports of cases across the country .
" the 1,049 figure is the highest number of measles cases recorded in england and wales since the current method of monitoring the disease was introduced in 1995 .
" this rise is due to relatively low mmr vaccine uptake over the past decade and there are now a large number of children who are not fully vaccinated with mmr .

more from today programme " this means that measles is spreading easily among unvaccinated children .
there is now a real risk of a large measles epidemic .
" these children are susceptible to not only measles but to mumps and rubella as well . "
dr david salisbury , the government 's head of immunisation , said : " this is something we have worried about for a considerable period of time .
" we saw a lot of measles in london , we are now seeing it spreading further around the rest of the country .
" measles is about the most infectious virus we know .
it just spreads like wildfire . "
school visits in central and eastern cheshire , health officials are so concerned about their outbreak of cases that they are embarking on a mass vaccination programme .
more than 10,000 children are being offered the mmr jab by teams of nurses who will visit primary and secondary schools in the next few weeks .
vaccination will not take place without the consent of parents .
a measles vaccine was introduced in the late 1960s , followed by the three-in-one mmr jab in 1988 .
although most children recover fully from measles , it can be a serious illness .
one in 10 cases requires hospital treatment and it can lead to pneumonia , brain damage and even death .
in 1965 there were 115 deaths from measles , but the rates fell off dramatically after the introduction of the vaccine .
joff mcgill , of the rubella charity sense stressed that it was also vital that children received mmr to protect them against rubella -lrb- also known as german measles -rrb- , a disease which if contracted by a woman while pregnant can leave her baby deaf and blind .
dr patricia hamilton , president , royal college of paediatrics and child health said the latest figures were " very worrying " .
" we can not stress too strongly that all children and young people should have the mmr vaccine .
" overwhelming scientific evidence shows that the vaccine is safe .
measles can have very serious effects . "

measles cases in england and wales have topped 1,000 in a year for the first time in more than a decade , health protection agency figures show .
in the first 10 months of 2008 there were 1,049 cases , more than in the whole of 2007 , the agency said .
it said measles was spreading more easily because of the low uptake of the combined mmr jab over the past decade .
in cheshire , an outbreak of more than 60 cases has prompted the launch of a programme to vaccinate 10,000 pupils .
the decade of relatively low vaccination coverage was triggered by now-debunked research claims of a link between the combined measles , mumps and rubella jab and autism .

it is estimated this could result in between 30,000 and 100,000 cases of measles in england alone .
although mmr coverage is higher in scotland and northern ireland , experts said an epidemic could affect children anywhere .
dr mary ramsay , an immunisation expert at the health protection agency , said : " over the last few years we have seen an unprecedented increase in measles cases and we are still receiving reports of cases across the country .
" the 1,049 figure is the highest number of measles cases recorded in england and wales since the current method of monitoring the disease was introduced in 1995 .
" this rise is due to relatively low mmr vaccine uptake over the past decade and there are now a large number of children who are not fully vaccinated with mmr .

set up for a one-year trial on the fourth floor of a walk-in centre , it 's the first nhs clinic for gambling addicts .
supporters say this initiative is long overdue .
rob , a 50-year-old recovering addict helped by gamblers anonymous , said : " any form of therapy or clinic - especially for young people - could save lives , or even give them a quality of life . "
for rob , his path to gambling all started as a boy in belfast , with errands to the bookies for his brothers .
then there were roulette machines , pitch and toss in the street , cards and visits to the greyhounds four or five times a week .
' illness of want ' " it progressed in a way that anything i had , i had to gamble .
and i actually stole things in order to fuel my gambling .
i 'm not proud of that but that 's the way it was . "
rob says through gambling he became " embedded in his own hell " .
he was unable to communicate , to have relationships , or to do his work because of his consuming obsession .
he said : " it 's the illness of want .
i want it and i want it now .
gambling paints a pretty picture like a holiday in the bahamas whereby you can have these things .
" it 's like a pied piper coercing you in .
and that appeals to young people . "
the walk-in clinic is being run in soho for a one year trial for years rob was fixated with winning back his losses .
he thought he had a financial problem , not an illness .
but , through his involvement with gamblers anonymous , he developed a better understanding of his condition .
the lead consultant psychiatrist at the new nhs gambling clinic , dr henrietta bowden-jones , said that across society perceptions of gambling are changing .
she said : " people are beginning to realise that it 's a serious illness that can cause people to become suicidal , that can lead people to lose their homes , to lose the relationships they most care about , and in many cases leads people who are extremely moral people to commit illegal acts to fund their addiction . "
' training colleagues ' the clinic helps people with extreme gambling problems , who may be referred on by counselling services or their gp , or they may refer themselves .
there 's an initial hour-and-a-half psychiatric assessment with dr bowden-jones .
then there are 12 weeks of one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy , another 12 weeks of group therapy , plus help for depression and anxiety , support for families and advice on managing debts .
it 's thought there are about 300,000 problem gamblers across the uk .
dr bowden-jones hopes this clinic is just the start of a much wider service .
" my dream in the future would be to have other nhs centres set up throughout the country .
and i 've been training colleagues , psychiatrists in the subject , in the hope that people will be interested and want to pick it up . "
this is something the british medical association also wants to see .
last year it published a report spelling out the health risks of gambling addiction , warning of the particular threat to young people from fruit machines and online gambling .
the bma 's head of science and ethics , dr vivienne nathanson , said the gambling industry should do much more to pay for the harm caused by addiction .
compulsory levy ?
" i think it 's an interesting question whether the nhs should pay for it and we certainly believe that the levy on the gambling industry which is there to fund good causes , including education about gambling addiction , should be producing more money , and that that money should support many of these clinics . "
the gaming industry supports problem gamblers through voluntary donations to the responsibility in gambling trust .
it has helped to fund the new clinic in soho , and also supports gambling research and education .
the bma has warned of the health risks of gambling addiction , it has agreed a target this year of £ 4.5m with the industry , but donations look set to fall well short .
the government is looking at whether to make the levy compulsory .
the trust 's director , malcolm bruce , said this was no idle threat .
he said : " we 're not confident of reaching our target , but it 's still in the gift of the gambling industry to put that money forward .
" otherwise there will be a levy on the gambling industry and they will be forced to pay for this whole area .
and that would be really unfortunate because some excellent progress has been made over the past seven or eight years in this area . "
the clinic in soho has already seen patients from all over england .
if it proves successful , pressure will grow on the nhs to set up similar clinics across the country , and that will prompt further questions about who foots the bill .

advertisement bbc medical correspondent fergus walsh visits the laboratory that confirms measles cases for the whole of the uk .
measles cases in england and wales have topped 1,000 in a year for the first time in more than a decade , health protection agency figures show .
in the first 10 months of 2008 there were 1,049 cases , more than in the whole of 2007 , the agency said .
it said measles was spreading more easily because of the low uptake of the combined mmr jab over the past decade .
in cheshire , an outbreak of more than 60 cases has prompted the launch of a programme to vaccinate 10,000 pupils .
the decade of relatively low vaccination coverage was triggered by now-debunked research claims of a link between the combined measles , mumps and rubella jab and autism .
yearly measles cases 1996 - 112 cases 1997 - 177 1998 - 56 1999 - 92 2000 - 100 2001 - 70 2002 - 319 2003 - 437 2004 - 188 2005 - 78 2006 - 740 2007 - 990 2008 to october - 1,049 q & a : measles public health experts say the growing number of children who are unprotected - about 3m or one in four have not had both mmr doses - means there is a real risk of an epidemic .
it is estimated this could result in between 30,000 and 100,000 cases of measles in england alone .
although mmr coverage is higher in scotland and northern ireland , experts said an epidemic could affect children anywhere .
dr mary ramsay , an immunisation expert at the health protection agency , said : " over the last few years we have seen an unprecedented increase in measles cases and we are still receiving reports of cases across the country .
" the 1,049 figure is the highest number of measles cases recorded in england and wales since the current method of monitoring the disease was introduced in 1995 .
" this rise is due to relatively low mmr vaccine uptake over the past decade and there are now a large number of children who are not fully vaccinated with mmr .

more from today programme " this means that measles is spreading easily among unvaccinated children .
there is now a real risk of a large measles epidemic .
" these children are susceptible to not only measles but to mumps and rubella as well . "
dr david salisbury , the government 's head of immunisation , said : " this is something we have worried about for a considerable period of time .
" we saw a lot of measles in london , we are now seeing it spreading further around the rest of the country .
" measles is about the most infectious virus we know .
it just spreads like wildfire . "
school visits in central and eastern cheshire , health officials are so concerned about their outbreak of cases that they are embarking on a mass vaccination programme .
more than 10,000 children are being offered the mmr jab by teams of nurses who will visit primary and secondary schools in the next few weeks .
vaccination will not take place without the consent of parents .
a measles vaccine was introduced in the late 1960s , followed by the three-in-one mmr jab in 1988 .
although most children recover fully from measles , it can be a serious illness .
one in 10 cases requires hospital treatment and it can lead to pneumonia , brain damage and even death .
in 1965 there were 115 deaths from measles , but the rates fell off dramatically after the introduction of the vaccine .
joff mcgill , of the rubella charity sense stressed that it was also vital that children received mmr to protect them against rubella -lrb- also known as german measles -rrb- , a disease which if contracted by a woman while pregnant can leave her baby deaf and blind .
dr patricia hamilton , president , royal college of paediatrics and child health said the latest figures were " very worrying " .
" we can not stress too strongly that all children and young people should have the mmr vaccine .
" overwhelming scientific evidence shows that the vaccine is safe .
measles can have very serious effects . "

set up for a one-year trial on the fourth floor of a walk-in centre , it 's the first nhs clinic for gambling addicts .
supporters say this initiative is long overdue .
rob , a 50-year-old recovering addict helped by gamblers anonymous , said : " any form of therapy or clinic - especially for young people - could save lives , or even give them a quality of life . "
for rob , his path to gambling all started as a boy in belfast , with errands to the bookies for his brothers .
then there were roulette machines , pitch and toss in the street , cards and visits to the greyhounds four or five times a week .
' illness of want ' " it progressed in a way that anything i had , i had to gamble .
and i actually stole things in order to fuel my gambling .
i 'm not proud of that but that 's the way it was . "
rob says through gambling he became " embedded in his own hell " .
he was unable to communicate , to have relationships , or to do his work because of his consuming obsession .
he said : " it 's the illness of want .
i want it and i want it now .
gambling paints a pretty picture like a holiday in the bahamas whereby you can have these things .
" it 's like a pied piper coercing you in .
and that appeals to young people . "
the walk-in clinic is being run in soho for a one year trial for years rob was fixated with winning back his losses .
he thought he had a financial problem , not an illness .
but , through his involvement with gamblers anonymous , he developed a better understanding of his condition .
the lead consultant psychiatrist at the new nhs gambling clinic , dr henrietta bowden-jones , said that across society perceptions of gambling are changing .
she said : " people are beginning to realise that it 's a serious illness that can cause people to become suicidal , that can lead people to lose their homes , to lose the relationships they most care about , and in many cases leads people who are extremely moral people to commit illegal acts to fund their addiction . "
' training colleagues ' the clinic helps people with extreme gambling problems , who may be referred on by counselling services or their gp , or they may refer themselves .
there 's an initial hour-and-a-half psychiatric assessment with dr bowden-jones .
then there are 12 weeks of one-to-one cognitive behavioural therapy , another 12 weeks of group therapy , plus help for depression and anxiety , support for families and advice on managing debts .
it 's thought there are about 300,000 problem gamblers across the uk .
dr bowden-jones hopes this clinic is just the start of a much wider service .
" my dream in the future would be to have other nhs centres set up throughout the country .
and i 've been training colleagues , psychiatrists in the subject , in the hope that people will be interested and want to pick it up . "
this is something the british medical association also wants to see .
last year it published a report spelling out the health risks of gambling addiction , warning of the particular threat to young people from fruit machines and online gambling .
the bma 's head of science and ethics , dr vivienne nathanson , said the gambling industry should do much more to pay for the harm caused by addiction .
compulsory levy ?
" i think it 's an interesting question whether the nhs should pay for it and we certainly believe that the levy on the gambling industry which is there to fund good causes , including education about gambling addiction , should be producing more money , and that that money should support many of these clinics . "
the gaming industry supports problem gamblers through voluntary donations to the responsibility in gambling trust .
it has helped to fund the new clinic in soho , and also supports gambling research and education .
the bma has warned of the health risks of gambling addiction , it has agreed a target this year of £ 4.5m with the industry , but donations look set to fall well short .
the government is looking at whether to make the levy compulsory .
the trust 's director , malcolm bruce , said this was no idle threat .
he said : " we 're not confident of reaching our target , but it 's still in the gift of the gambling industry to put that money forward .
" otherwise there will be a levy on the gambling industry and they will be forced to pay for this whole area .
and that would be really unfortunate because some excellent progress has been made over the past seven or eight years in this area . "
the clinic in soho has already seen patients from all over england .
if it proves successful , pressure will grow on the nhs to set up similar clinics across the country , and that will prompt further questions about who foots the bill .

the killing took place against the backdrop of a global feud between the hells angels and a rival biker gang , the outlaws .
but what started the bad blood ? "
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard " julian sher author , angels of death the hells angels are the world 's most infamous motorcycle club .
there are around 2,500 full members - who are allowed to wear the club 's " patches " on their backs - across north america , europe and australasia and hundreds more " prospects " and associates .
but in the 1960s and 1970s several other gangs emerged who would become their sworn enemies .
they included the bandidos , the outlaws , the mongols and the pagans .
julian sher , a canadian investigative journalist and author of two books on biker gangs , told bbc news : " these other gangs hate the hells angels ... because they are so dominant . "
he said : " sometimes it is a turf war over drugs or the sex trade but often it 's just to do with the pride of the patch .
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard . "
between 1994 and 1997 the hells angels and bandidos across scandinavia fought what was described as the " great nordic biker war " .
at least 11 people were killed and dozens injured in a bloody power struggle involving car bombs , machine guns and even anti-tank rockets stolen from a swedish army depot .
uneasy truce the " war " ended in an uneasy truce .
the feud between the hells angels and the outlaws - which led to gerry tobin 's murder - dates back nearly 40 years .
in 1969 the wife of an american hells angel is believed to have been raped by an outlaw , who was subsequently beaten up and almost killed in revenge .
biker gangs hells angels - formed in california in 1948 .
now has 235 chapters around the world .
sometimes referred to as the 81 from the letters of the alphabet -lrb- ha = 81 -rrb- .
outlaws - formed in illinois in 1930s .
have spread to europe and are bitter enemies of hells angels .
bandidos - formed in the us but are now very strong in scandinavia , where they clashed with the hells angels .
mongols - founded in california in the 1970s by hispanic bikers refused entry to the hells angels .
they have spread worldwide .
pagans - formed in 1959 in maryland but have spread throughout us and abroad .
allied to the outlaws .
rock machine - french-canadian gang who were involved in a bitter war with hells angels in quebec in 1990s .
allied to bandidos .
the outlaws hit back by shooting dead three hells angels , whose bodies were dumped in a quarry in florida .
the hatred has grown ever since and has spread across the globe wherever the two have formed chapters , or clubs .
in 1987 the british wing of the hells angels wanted to hold an annual get-together and needed a venue .
they chose the former long marston airfield , an isolated site a few miles outside stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire , which was to become home to the bulldog bash .
unfortunately the coventry and warwickshire chapter of the outlaws believed the site was on their turf and their resentment grew over the years .
in britain several smaller clubs are allied to the hells angels .
at this year 's bulldog bash there were patches on show belonging to the barbarians , the confederates , the devil 's disciples , the end -lrb- from hampshire -rrb- and the predators -lrb- from somerset -rrb- .
other gangs are allied to the outlaws or the bandidos .
in 1998 two bikers were left dead when 40 hells angels attacked a gang called the outcasts - allies of the outlaws - at the rockers ' reunion gathering in battersea , south london .
ronald " gut " wait , vice-president of the hells angels ' essex chapter , was eventually jailed for 15 years for conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm .
later that year the outlaws threatened to bomb the bulldog bash and in 2000 the coventry outlaws became official affiliates of the american outlaw association .
vow of silence tension between the gangs spilled over in august 2001 when a hells angel was shot three times in the leg as he left the bulldog bash .
the shooting , on the m40 motorway , was almost identical to the attack on gerry tobin but in this case the victim survived .
he refused to make a statement to the police , as is customary with biker gangs .
globally the feud has spiralled in recent years .
in 2006 an outlaws chief in new hampshire , christopher legere , was convicted of murdering a man who was wearing a hells angels t-shirt .
later that year two canadian hells angels shot several outlaws at the world 's biggest biker rally in sturgis , south dakota .
early in 2007 the uk chapter of the outlaws took over the european " presidency " and might have felt under pressure from peers to up the ante against the hells angels .
mr sher believes this may have been a key factor in the killing of gerry tobin , who was shot as he returned home from the bulldog bash .
his murder on a busy motorway on a sunday afternoon was clearly a signal to bikers across the world .
shortly after his killing an outlaws clubhouse in scandinavia was attacked , and one person was killed .
there were other incidents in britain , some of which can not be reported for legal reasons .
police feared another violent incident at this year 's bulldog bash and they opposed the renewal of its entertainment licence .
the local council overruled them and it passed without incident .
hells angels in this country insist they are simply motorbike enthusiasts and not a criminal gang and they accuse the police of exaggerating the idea of a feud .
one hells angel told the bbc there was not a jot of evidence to support the police 's assertion that they had planned to take revenge for gerry tobin 's death .
when the trial began one of the outlaws , sean creighton , pleaded guilty and basically sought to take the rap for the whole gang .
but it did not work and six other men were later convicted .
police hope there will be no further bloodshed .
but mr sher is not hopeful and says : " a lot of people in britain have this idea of bikers as loveable rascals ; they took part in the golden jubilee parade and their pr is often good .
" but whenever these rival gangs compete there is violence . "

vow of silence tension between the gangs spilled over in august 2001 when a hells angel was shot three times in the leg as he left the bulldog bash .
the shooting , on the m40 motorway , was almost identical to the attack on gerry tobin but in this case the victim survived .
he refused to make a statement to the police , as is customary with biker gangs .
globally the feud has spiralled in recent years .
at this year 's bulldog bash this special tribute bike was on display in 2006 an outlaws chief in new hampshire , christopher legere , was convicted of murdering a man who was wearing a hells angels t-shirt .
later that year two canadian hells angels shot several outlaws at the world 's biggest biker rally in sturgis , south dakota .
early in 2007 the uk chapter of the outlaws took over the european " presidency " and might have felt under pressure from peers to up the ante against the hells angels .
mr sher believes this may have been a key factor in the killing of gerry tobin , who was shot as he returned home from the bulldog bash .
his murder on a busy motorway on a sunday afternoon was clearly a signal to bikers across the world .
shortly after his killing an outlaws clubhouse in scandinavia was attacked , and one person was killed .
sean creighton tried to take the rap for the whole gang there were other incidents in britain , some of which can not be reported for legal reasons .
police feared another violent incident at this year 's bulldog bash and they opposed the renewal of its entertainment licence .
the local council overruled them and it passed without incident .
hells angels in this country insist they are simply motorbike enthusiasts and not a criminal gang and they accuse the police of exaggerating the idea of a feud .
one hells angel told the bbc there was not a jot of evidence to support the police 's assertion that they had planned to take revenge for gerry tobin 's death .
when the trial began one of the outlaws , sean creighton , pleaded guilty and basically sought to take the rap for the whole gang .
but it did not work and six other men were later convicted .
police hope there will be no further bloodshed .
but mr sher is not hopeful and says : " a lot of people in britain have this idea of bikers as loveable rascals ; they took part in the golden jubilee parade and their pr is often good .
" but whenever these rival gangs compete there is violence . "

the killing took place against the backdrop of a global feud between the hells angels and a rival biker gang , the outlaws .
but what started the bad blood ?
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard julian sher author , angels of death the hells angels are the world 's most infamous motorcycle club .
there are around 2,500 full members - who are allowed to wear the club 's " patches " on their backs - across north america , europe and australasia and hundreds more " prospects " and associates .
but in the 1960s and 1970s several other gangs emerged who would become their sworn enemies .
they included the bandidos , the outlaws , the mongols and the pagans .
julian sher , a canadian investigative journalist and author of two books on biker gangs , told bbc news : " these other gangs hate the hells angels ... because they are so dominant . "
he said : " sometimes it is a turf war over drugs or the sex trade but often it 's just to do with the pride of the patch .
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard . "
between 1994 and 1997 the hells angels and bandidos across scandinavia fought what was described as the " great nordic biker war " .
at least 11 people were killed and dozens injured in a bloody power struggle involving car bombs , machine guns and even anti-tank rockets stolen from a swedish army depot .
uneasy truce the " war " ended in an uneasy truce .
the feud between the hells angels and the outlaws - which led to gerry tobin 's murder - dates back nearly 40 years .
in 1969 the wife of an american hells angel is believed to have been raped by an outlaw , who was subsequently beaten up and almost killed in revenge .
biker gangs hells angels - formed in california in 1948 .
now has 235 chapters around the world .
sometimes referred to as the 81 from the letters of the alphabet -lrb- ha = 81 -rrb- .
outlaws - formed in illinois in 1930s .
have spread to europe and are bitter enemies of hells angels .
bandidos - formed in the us but are now very strong in scandinavia , where they clashed with the hells angels .
mongols - founded in california in the 1970s by hispanic bikers refused entry to the hells angels .
they have spread worldwide .
pagans - formed in 1959 in maryland but have spread throughout us and abroad .
allied to the outlaws .
rock machine - french-canadian gang who were involved in a bitter war with hells angels in quebec in 1990s .
allied to bandidos .
the outlaws hit back by shooting dead three hells angels , whose bodies were dumped in a quarry in florida .
the hatred has grown ever since and has spread across the globe wherever the two have formed chapters , or clubs .
in 1987 the british wing of the hells angels wanted to hold an annual get-together and needed a venue .
they chose the former long marston airfield , an isolated site a few miles outside stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire , which was to become home to the bulldog bash .
unfortunately the coventry and warwickshire chapter of the outlaws believed the site was on their turf and their resentment grew over the years .
in britain several smaller clubs are allied to the hells angels .
at this year 's bulldog bash there were patches on show belonging to the barbarians , the confederates , the devil 's disciples , the end -lrb- from hampshire -rrb- and the predators -lrb- from somerset -rrb- .
other gangs are allied to the outlaws or the bandidos .
in 1998 two bikers were left dead when 40 hells angels attacked a gang called the outcasts - allies of the outlaws - at the rockers ' reunion gathering in battersea , south london .
ronald " gut " wait , vice-president of the hells angels ' essex chapter , was eventually jailed for 15 years for conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm .
later that year the outlaws threatened to bomb the bulldog bash and in 2000 the coventry outlaws became official affiliates of the american outlaw association .
vow of silence tension between the gangs spilled over in august 2001 when a hells angel was shot three times in the leg as he left the bulldog bash .
the shooting , on the m40 motorway , was almost identical to the attack on gerry tobin but in this case the victim survived .
he refused to make a statement to the police , as is customary with biker gangs .
globally the feud has spiralled in recent years .
at this year 's bulldog bash this special tribute bike was on display in 2006 an outlaws chief in new hampshire , christopher legere , was convicted of murdering a man who was wearing a hells angels t-shirt .
later that year two canadian hells angels shot several outlaws at the world 's biggest biker rally in sturgis , south dakota .
early in 2007 the uk chapter of the outlaws took over the european " presidency " and might have felt under pressure from peers to up the ante against the hells angels .
mr sher believes this may have been a key factor in the killing of gerry tobin , who was shot as he returned home from the bulldog bash .
his murder on a busy motorway on a sunday afternoon was clearly a signal to bikers across the world .
shortly after his killing an outlaws clubhouse in scandinavia was attacked , and one person was killed .
sean creighton tried to take the rap for the whole gang there were other incidents in britain , some of which can not be reported for legal reasons .
police feared another violent incident at this year 's bulldog bash and they opposed the renewal of its entertainment licence .
the local council overruled them and it passed without incident .
hells angels in this country insist they are simply motorbike enthusiasts and not a criminal gang and they accuse the police of exaggerating the idea of a feud .
one hells angel told the bbc there was not a jot of evidence to support the police 's assertion that they had planned to take revenge for gerry tobin 's death .

the killing took place against the backdrop of a global feud between the hells angels and a rival biker gang , the outlaws .
but what started the bad blood ?
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard julian sher author , angels of death the hells angels are the world 's most infamous motorcycle club .
there are around 2,500 full members - who are allowed to wear the club 's " patches " on their backs - across north america , europe and australasia and hundreds more " prospects " and associates .
but in the 1960s and 1970s several other gangs emerged who would become their sworn enemies .
they included the bandidos , the outlaws , the mongols and the pagans .
julian sher , a canadian investigative journalist and author of two books on biker gangs , told bbc news : " these other gangs hate the hells angels ... because they are so dominant . "
he said : " sometimes it is a turf war over drugs or the sex trade but often it 's just to do with the pride of the patch .
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard . "
between 1994 and 1997 the hells angels and bandidos across scandinavia fought what was described as the " great nordic biker war " .
at least 11 people were killed and dozens injured in a bloody power struggle involving car bombs , machine guns and even anti-tank rockets stolen from a swedish army depot .
uneasy truce the " war " ended in an uneasy truce .
the feud between the hells angels and the outlaws - which led to gerry tobin 's murder - dates back nearly 40 years .
in 1969 the wife of an american hells angel is believed to have been raped by an outlaw , who was subsequently beaten up and almost killed in revenge .
biker gangs hells angels - formed in california in 1948 .
now has 235 chapters around the world .
sometimes referred to as the 81 from the letters of the alphabet -lrb- ha = 81 -rrb- .
outlaws - formed in illinois in 1930s .
have spread to europe and are bitter enemies of hells angels .
bandidos - formed in the us but are now very strong in scandinavia , where they clashed with the hells angels .
mongols - founded in california in the 1970s by hispanic bikers refused entry to the hells angels .
they have spread worldwide .
pagans - formed in 1959 in maryland but have spread throughout us and abroad .
allied to the outlaws .
rock machine - french-canadian gang who were involved in a bitter war with hells angels in quebec in 1990s .
allied to bandidos .
the outlaws hit back by shooting dead three hells angels , whose bodies were dumped in a quarry in florida .
the hatred has grown ever since and has spread across the globe wherever the two have formed chapters , or clubs .
in 1987 the british wing of the hells angels wanted to hold an annual get-together and needed a venue .
they chose the former long marston airfield , an isolated site a few miles outside stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire , which was to become home to the bulldog bash .
unfortunately the coventry and warwickshire chapter of the outlaws believed the site was on their turf and their resentment grew over the years .
in britain several smaller clubs are allied to the hells angels .
at this year 's bulldog bash there were patches on show belonging to the barbarians , the confederates , the devil 's disciples , the end -lrb- from hampshire -rrb- and the predators -lrb- from somerset -rrb- .
other gangs are allied to the outlaws or the bandidos .
in 1998 two bikers were left dead when 40 hells angels attacked a gang called the outcasts - allies of the outlaws - at the rockers ' reunion gathering in battersea , south london .
ronald " gut " wait , vice-president of the hells angels ' essex chapter , was eventually jailed for 15 years for conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm .
later that year the outlaws threatened to bomb the bulldog bash and in 2000 the coventry outlaws became official affiliates of the american outlaw association .
vow of silence tension between the gangs spilled over in august 2001 when a hells angel was shot three times in the leg as he left the bulldog bash .
the shooting , on the m40 motorway , was almost identical to the attack on gerry tobin but in this case the victim survived .
he refused to make a statement to the police , as is customary with biker gangs .
globally the feud has spiralled in recent years .
at this year 's bulldog bash this special tribute bike was on display in 2006 an outlaws chief in new hampshire , christopher legere , was convicted of murdering a man who was wearing a hells angels t-shirt .
later that year two canadian hells angels shot several outlaws at the world 's biggest biker rally in sturgis , south dakota .
early in 2007 the uk chapter of the outlaws took over the european " presidency " and might have felt under pressure from peers to up the ante against the hells angels .
mr sher believes this may have been a key factor in the killing of gerry tobin , who was shot as he returned home from the bulldog bash .
his murder on a busy motorway on a sunday afternoon was clearly a signal to bikers across the world .
shortly after his killing an outlaws clubhouse in scandinavia was attacked , and one person was killed .
sean creighton tried to take the rap for the whole gang there were other incidents in britain , some of which can not be reported for legal reasons .
police feared another violent incident at this year 's bulldog bash and they opposed the renewal of its entertainment licence .
the local council overruled them and it passed without incident .
hells angels in this country insist they are simply motorbike enthusiasts and not a criminal gang and they accuse the police of exaggerating the idea of a feud .
one hells angel told the bbc there was not a jot of evidence to support the police 's assertion that they had planned to take revenge for gerry tobin 's death .
when the trial began one of the outlaws , sean creighton , pleaded guilty and basically sought to take the rap for the whole gang .
but it did not work and six other men were later convicted .
police hope there will be no further bloodshed .
but mr sher is not hopeful and says : " a lot of people in britain have this idea of bikers as loveable rascals ; they took part in the golden jubilee parade and their pr is often good .
" but whenever these rival gangs compete there is violence . "

the killing took place against the backdrop of a global feud between the hells angels and a rival biker gang , the outlaws .
but what started the bad blood ?
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard julian sher author , angels of death the hells angels are the world 's most infamous motorcycle club .
there are around 2,500 full members - who are allowed to wear the club 's " patches " on their backs - across north america , europe and australasia and hundreds more " prospects " and associates .
but in the 1960s and 1970s several other gangs emerged who would become their sworn enemies .
they included the bandidos , the outlaws , the mongols and the pagans .
julian sher , a canadian investigative journalist and author of two books on biker gangs , told bbc news : " these other gangs hate the hells angels ... because they are so dominant . "
he said : " sometimes it is a turf war over drugs or the sex trade but often it 's just to do with the pride of the patch .
a lot of it is just to do with ego and testosterone ; it 's about macho chest-thumping and who is the toughest pitbull in the junkyard . "
between 1994 and 1997 the hells angels and bandidos across scandinavia fought what was described as the " great nordic biker war " .
at least 11 people were killed and dozens injured in a bloody power struggle involving car bombs , machine guns and even anti-tank rockets stolen from a swedish army depot .
uneasy truce the " war " ended in an uneasy truce .
the feud between the hells angels and the outlaws - which led to gerry tobin 's murder - dates back nearly 40 years .
in 1969 the wife of an american hells angel is believed to have been raped by an outlaw , who was subsequently beaten up and almost killed in revenge .
biker gangs hells angels - formed in california in 1948 .
now has 235 chapters around the world .
sometimes referred to as the 81 from the letters of the alphabet -lrb- ha = 81 -rrb- .
outlaws - formed in illinois in 1930s .
have spread to europe and are bitter enemies of hells angels .
bandidos - formed in the us but are now very strong in scandinavia , where they clashed with the hells angels .
mongols - founded in california in the 1970s by hispanic bikers refused entry to the hells angels .
they have spread worldwide .
pagans - formed in 1959 in maryland but have spread throughout us and abroad .
allied to the outlaws .
rock machine - french-canadian gang who were involved in a bitter war with hells angels in quebec in 1990s .
allied to bandidos .
the outlaws hit back by shooting dead three hells angels , whose bodies were dumped in a quarry in florida .
the hatred has grown ever since and has spread across the globe wherever the two have formed chapters , or clubs .
in 1987 the british wing of the hells angels wanted to hold an annual get-together and needed a venue .
they chose the former long marston airfield , an isolated site a few miles outside stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire , which was to become home to the bulldog bash .
unfortunately the coventry and warwickshire chapter of the outlaws believed the site was on their turf and their resentment grew over the years .
in britain several smaller clubs are allied to the hells angels .
at this year 's bulldog bash there were patches on show belonging to the barbarians , the confederates , the devil 's disciples , the end -lrb- from hampshire -rrb- and the predators -lrb- from somerset -rrb- .
other gangs are allied to the outlaws or the bandidos .
in 1998 two bikers were left dead when 40 hells angels attacked a gang called the outcasts - allies of the outlaws - at the rockers ' reunion gathering in battersea , south london .
ronald " gut " wait , vice-president of the hells angels ' essex chapter , was eventually jailed for 15 years for conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm .
later that year the outlaws threatened to bomb the bulldog bash and in 2000 the coventry outlaws became official affiliates of the american outlaw association .
vow of silence tension between the gangs spilled over in august 2001 when a hells angel was shot three times in the leg as he left the bulldog bash .
the shooting , on the m40 motorway , was almost identical to the attack on gerry tobin but in this case the victim survived .
he refused to make a statement to the police , as is customary with biker gangs .
globally the feud has spiralled in recent years .
at this year 's bulldog bash this special tribute bike was on display in 2006 an outlaws chief in new hampshire , christopher legere , was convicted of murdering a man who was wearing a hells angels t-shirt .
later that year two canadian hells angels shot several outlaws at the world 's biggest biker rally in sturgis , south dakota .
early in 2007 the uk chapter of the outlaws took over the european " presidency " and might have felt under pressure from peers to up the ante against the hells angels .
mr sher believes this may have been a key factor in the killing of gerry tobin , who was shot as he returned home from the bulldog bash .
his murder on a busy motorway on a sunday afternoon was clearly a signal to bikers across the world .
shortly after his killing an outlaws clubhouse in scandinavia was attacked , and one person was killed .
sean creighton tried to take the rap for the whole gang there were other incidents in britain , some of which can not be reported for legal reasons .
police feared another violent incident at this year 's bulldog bash and they opposed the renewal of its entertainment licence .
the local council overruled them and it passed without incident .
hells angels in this country insist they are simply motorbike enthusiasts and not a criminal gang and they accuse the police of exaggerating the idea of a feud .
one hells angel told the bbc there was not a jot of evidence to support the police 's assertion that they had planned to take revenge for gerry tobin 's death .
when the trial began one of the outlaws , sean creighton , pleaded guilty and basically sought to take the rap for the whole gang .
but it did not work and six other men were later convicted .
police hope there will be no further bloodshed .
but mr sher is not hopeful and says : " a lot of people in britain have this idea of bikers as loveable rascals ; they took part in the golden jubilee parade and their pr is often good .
" but whenever these rival gangs compete there is violence . "

advertisement sir ian blair had criticised mayor boris johnson the law must change to prevent another metropolitan police commissioner being forced out by london 's mayor , the outgoing chief of the force has said .
sir ian blair quit in october , saying he did not have the support of boris johnson , who was elected mayor in may .
speaking in his final interview , sir ian warned against politicians trying to hire and fire police chiefs .
london 's mayor has no power over the commissioner , but mr johnson had become chairman of the met 's police authority .
' no choice ' the metropolitan police authority -lrb- mpa -rrb- , which oversees the force and approves its strategies and spending , has been chaired by the mayor since the law was changed earlier this year .
the mayor leads public scrutiny of the force and sir ian said that without mr johnson 's support for his position , business would have become impossible had he not quit .
he said he quit to protect the met from a damaging row .
it was a very political move by him and an imitation of new york sir ian blair on boris johnson it is the home secretary who appoints the commissioner because the post combines local policing duties with national responsibilities , including counter-terrorism and security .
" it was a very political move by -lsb- mr johnson -rsb- and an imitation of new york , " sir ian said .
" during the 20th century , there were 16 metropolitan police commissioners .
there were 40 in new york as they came and went at the direction of the mayor .
" that 's not the british system .
it does not take sufficient account of the other burdens of this office , in terms of national security , and i hope that it 's something that wo n't be repeated .
" i am a public servant and he -lsb- the mayor -rsb- has a very large majority .
i do n't happen to like the way he has used it , but … i had no choice . "
he said it was a choice that had not pleased home secretary jacqui smith , but added that she could see there were circumstances in which " the way the political settlement has been laid in london that this is the possibility " .
lawrence case he added : " i think someone will have to look at the legislation because it 's quite easy to imagine it happening exactly the other way around in four or eight years ' time .
and i do n't think that 's a good plan . "
sir ian said he had spoken to " two or three " senior police officers who he expected to apply for the commissioner 's post and told them that they had to be " resolute " in how they approached the post because of what had happened to him .
" i said in one early interview -lsb- after his 2005 appointment -rsb- that you need copper-bottomed trousers to be in this office and i can only suggest that he or she gets a pair pretty soon , " he added .
sir ian blair said the most pressing problem for london 's policing was the 31 killings of young people during 2008 .
and turning to the murder of stephen lawrence , he said : " the case is not closed .
they should be worried that we will pursue -lsb- the killers -rsb- to the ends of their lives .
we will keep doing that . "
sir ian and mr johnson came face-to-face at the outgoing commissioner 's last meeting with the mpa on thursday .
speaking at city hall in london , mr johnson described sir ian as " a very distinguished public servant " and " one of the most thoughtful minds in modern policing " .
the mayor said sir ian 's " enormous contribution " to policing and public safety included the " magnificent " way the met responded to the 7 july 2005 bombings .

advertisement sir ian blair had criticised mayor boris johnson the law must change to prevent another metropolitan police commissioner being forced out by london 's mayor , the outgoing chief of the force has said .
sir ian blair quit in october , saying he did not have the support of boris johnson , who was elected mayor in may .
speaking in his final interview , sir ian warned against politicians trying to hire and fire police chiefs .
london 's mayor has no power over the commissioner , but mr johnson had become chairman of the met 's police authority .
' no choice ' the metropolitan police authority -lrb- mpa -rrb- , which oversees the force and approves its strategies and spending , has been chaired by the mayor since the law was changed earlier this year .
the mayor leads public scrutiny of the force and sir ian said that without mr johnson 's support for his position , business would have become impossible had he not quit .
he said he quit to protect the met from a damaging row .
it was a very political move by him and an imitation of new york sir ian blair on boris johnson it is the home secretary who appoints the commissioner because the post combines local policing duties with national responsibilities , including counter-terrorism and security .
" it was a very political move by -lsb- mr johnson -rsb- and an imitation of new york , " sir ian said .
" during the 20th century , there were 16 metropolitan police commissioners .
there were 40 in new york as they came and went at the direction of the mayor .
" that 's not the british system .
it does not take sufficient account of the other burdens of this office , in terms of national security , and i hope that it 's something that wo n't be repeated .
" i am a public servant and he -lsb- the mayor -rsb- has a very large majority .
i do n't happen to like the way he has used it , but … i had no choice . "
he said it was a choice that had not pleased home secretary jacqui smith , but added that she could see there were circumstances in which " the way the political settlement has been laid in london that this is the possibility " .
lawrence case he added : " i think someone will have to look at the legislation because it 's quite easy to imagine it happening exactly the other way around in four or eight years ' time .
and i do n't think that 's a good plan . "
sir ian said he had spoken to " two or three " senior police officers who he expected to apply for the commissioner 's post and told them that they had to be " resolute " in how they approached the post because of what had happened to him .
" i said in one early interview -lsb- after his 2005 appointment -rsb- that you need copper-bottomed trousers to be in this office and i can only suggest that he or she gets a pair pretty soon , " he added .
sir ian blair said the most pressing problem for london 's policing was the 31 killings of young people during 2008 .
and turning to the murder of stephen lawrence , he said : " the case is not closed .
they should be worried that we will pursue -lsb- the killers -rsb- to the ends of their lives .
we will keep doing that . "
sir ian and mr johnson came face-to-face at the outgoing commissioner 's last meeting with the mpa on thursday .
speaking at city hall in london , mr johnson described sir ian as " a very distinguished public servant " and " one of the most thoughtful minds in modern policing " .
the mayor said sir ian 's " enormous contribution " to policing and public safety included the " magnificent " way the met responded to the 7 july 2005 bombings .

advertisement sir ian blair had criticised mayor boris johnson the law must change to prevent another metropolitan police commissioner being forced out by london 's mayor , the outgoing chief of the force has said .
sir ian blair quit in october , saying he did not have the support of boris johnson , who was elected mayor in may .
speaking in his final interview , sir ian warned against politicians trying to hire and fire police chiefs .
london 's mayor has no power over the commissioner , but mr johnson had become chairman of the met 's police authority .
' no choice ' the metropolitan police authority -lrb- mpa -rrb- , which oversees the force and approves its strategies and spending , has been chaired by the mayor since the law was changed earlier this year .
the mayor leads public scrutiny of the force and sir ian said that without mr johnson 's support for his position , business would have become impossible had he not quit .
he said he quit to protect the met from a damaging row .
it was a very political move by him and an imitation of new york sir ian blair on boris johnson it is the home secretary who appoints the commissioner because the post combines local policing duties with national responsibilities , including counter-terrorism and security .
" it was a very political move by -lsb- mr johnson -rsb- and an imitation of new york , " sir ian said .
" during the 20th century , there were 16 metropolitan police commissioners .
there were 40 in new york as they came and went at the direction of the mayor .
" that 's not the british system .
it does not take sufficient account of the other burdens of this office , in terms of national security , and i hope that it 's something that wo n't be repeated .
" i am a public servant and he -lsb- the mayor -rsb- has a very large majority .
i do n't happen to like the way he has used it , but … i had no choice . "
he said it was a choice that had not pleased home secretary jacqui smith , but added that she could see there were circumstances in which " the way the political settlement has been laid in london that this is the possibility " .
lawrence case he added : " i think someone will have to look at the legislation because it 's quite easy to imagine it happening exactly the other way around in four or eight years ' time .
and i do n't think that 's a good plan . "
sir ian said he had spoken to " two or three " senior police officers who he expected to apply for the commissioner 's post and told them that they had to be " resolute " in how they approached the post because of what had happened to him .
" i said in one early interview -lsb- after his 2005 appointment -rsb- that you need copper-bottomed trousers to be in this office and i can only suggest that he or she gets a pair pretty soon , " he added .
sir ian blair said the most pressing problem for london 's policing was the 31 killings of young people during 2008 .
and turning to the murder of stephen lawrence , he said : " the case is not closed .
they should be worried that we will pursue -lsb- the killers -rsb- to the ends of their lives .
we will keep doing that . "
sir ian and mr johnson came face-to-face at the outgoing commissioner 's last meeting with the mpa on thursday .
speaking at city hall in london , mr johnson described sir ian as " a very distinguished public servant " and " one of the most thoughtful minds in modern policing " .
the mayor said sir ian 's " enormous contribution " to policing and public safety included the " magnificent " way the met responded to the 7 july 2005 bombings .

such attacks have occurred regularly , and with steadily increasing frequency , in recent years .
mumbai , india 's financial capital , has been targeted before .
in march 1993 , a series of car bombs were detonated at public landmarks across the city , including the stock exchange , killing 257 people .
those attacks , in which the city 's underworld played a key role , followed hindu-muslim violence in the city during december 1992 and january 1993 .
working-class muslims were the principal victims , often shot at point-blank range by members of the city 's police force .
in july 2006 , a series of bombs planted on mumbai 's commuter train network killed 183 people .
other indian cities have been regularly targeted as well , particularly delhi , the capital .
in october 2005 bombs exploded in crowded delhi markets on the eve of the festive day diwali , the festival of lights .
more than 60 people were killed .
most recently , in july 2008 , bombs exploded at a number of congested public locations in ahmedabad , the capital of the western state of gujarat .
gujarat , one of india 's most prosperous states , saw large-scale killings of muslims in 2002 after an arson attack on a train in the state killed 59 hindu nationalist activists .
more than 50 people were killed in the ahmedabad bombings .
a previously unknown group , the indian mujahideen , claimed responsibility .
the ahmedabad attacks were particularly vicious in that bombs were detonated outside the emergency facilities of city hospitals just as people injured in other explosions were being brought in by ambulances .
frontal assault so what is new about mumbai , november 2008 ? "
it is tempting to label the attackers as ' crazies ' - but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced " sumantra bose mumbai : a pakistan militant link ?
the obvious novelty is the use of frontal assault tactics instead of timed explosive devices .
this is new in the urban indian context .
there was one notable exception - an attack by a five-man squad armed with rifles and grenades on india 's parliament in new delhi in december 2001 .
the attackers were narrowly prevented by alert staff from gaining access to the building , where hundreds of parliamentarians and ministers were attending a session .
they were gunned down near the entrance by security personnel after an hour-long battle .
nine guards and parliament stewards also died .
this attack led to the crisis of 2002 between india and pakistan .
the indian government blamed pakistani religious radicals , and embarked on a major military build-up on the border with pakistan , to which pakistan responded with its own mobilisation .
the stand-off eventually wound down later in 2002 after months of tension and brinkmanship .
but frontal assaults , usually carried out by two-man teams firing semi-automatic rifles and lobbing grenades , were the favoured tactic of the insurgency in indian-administered kashmir between 1999 and 2003 .
fidayeen technique scores of such attacks were carried out by " fidayeen " -lrb- literally " death-defying " -rrb- squads in indian-administered kashmir during that period .
in many instances , these attacks led to confrontations lasting anywhere between 24 and 72 hours between the raiders and security forces , who were often constrained by the presence of trapped civilians .
most of the locations targeted were indian military and police installations in the kashmir valley , particularly in the regional capital srinagar .
but some attacks targeted civilians , especially in and around the hindu-majority city of jammu , in the southern part of indian-administered kashmir .
the perpetrators were not members of the main homegrown kashmiri insurgent group , the hizb-ul mujahideen -lrb- " warriors of the faith " -rrb- .
the fidayeen technique - a rudimentary form of " shock and awe " warfare - was introduced into kashmir by pakistani radical organisations that entered the kashmir insurgency from the mid-1990s onwards .
the large majority of fidayeen attacks in kashmir were perpetrated by one such organisation , the lashkar-e-toiba , headquartered in pakistan and founded and led by pakistani religious radicals .
the lashkar-e toiba did over time recruit a handful of local kashmiris as fidayeen cadre , but most of the attackers were pakistani nationals who had crossed into indian-administered kashmir .
fidayeen attacks have died down in kashmir since india-pakistan relations thawed from 2004 onward .
but the deployment of exactly the same tactic in central mumbai shows that this technique has now found a new and even more dangerous theatre in which to operate .
method the tactic is thus not without precedent , but the mayhem in mumbai may nonetheless mark a new chapter in the evolution of urban terrorism in india .
bombs planted in markets and on commuter trains kill and maim working-class and middle-class indians .
the gunmen who attacked two luxury hotels , and a fashionable cafe frequented by visiting westerners , have brought the " war " - as they see it - to india 's elite class , and to affluent westerners living in or visiting india 's most cosmopolitan city .
if reports that the gunmen specifically looked for american and british citizens to take hostage are true , it would suggest that this terrorist spectacular had little to do with the prejudice and discrimination many muslims do encounter in india .
it is tempting to label the attackers as " crazies " .
but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced .
it is more than likely that the masterminds are seasoned operatives and that the foot-soldiers , young as they may have been , had undergone rigorous training for months , perhaps years .
the attacks also show every sign of having been designed to maximise media attention on a global scale .
in other words , there is a method to the madness .

such attacks have occurred regularly , and with steadily increasing frequency , in recent years .
mumbai , india 's financial capital , has been targeted before .
in march 1993 , a series of car bombs were detonated at public landmarks across the city , including the stock exchange , killing 257 people .
those attacks , in which the city 's underworld played a key role , followed hindu-muslim violence in the city during december 1992 and january 1993 .
working-class muslims were the principal victims , often shot at point-blank range by members of the city 's police force .
in july 2006 , a series of bombs planted on mumbai 's commuter train network killed 183 people .
other indian cities have been regularly targeted as well , particularly delhi , the capital .
in october 2005 bombs exploded in crowded delhi markets on the eve of the festive day diwali , the festival of lights .
more than 60 people were killed .
most recently , in july 2008 , bombs exploded at a number of congested public locations in ahmedabad , the capital of the western state of gujarat .
india 's parliament was attacked in 2001 , leaving nine people dead .
gujarat , one of india 's most prosperous states , saw large-scale killings of muslims in 2002 after an arson attack on a train in the state killed 59 hindu nationalist activists .
more than 50 people were killed in the ahmedabad bombings .
a previously unknown group , the indian mujahideen , claimed responsibility .
the ahmedabad attacks were particularly vicious in that bombs were detonated outside the emergency facilities of city hospitals just as people injured in other explosions were being brought in by ambulances .
frontal assault so what is new about mumbai , november 2008 ?
it is tempting to label the attackers as ' crazies ' - but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced sumantra bose mumbai : a pakistan militant link ?
the obvious novelty is the use of frontal assault tactics instead of timed explosive devices .
this is new in the urban indian context .
there was one notable exception - an attack by a five-man squad armed with rifles and grenades on india 's parliament in new delhi in december 2001 .
the attackers were narrowly prevented by alert staff from gaining access to the building , where hundreds of parliamentarians and ministers were attending a session .
they were gunned down near the entrance by security personnel after an hour-long battle .
nine guards and parliament stewards also died .
this attack led to the crisis of 2002 between india and pakistan .
the indian government blamed pakistani religious radicals , and embarked on a major military build-up on the border with pakistan , to which pakistan responded with its own mobilisation .
the stand-off eventually wound down later in 2002 after months of tension and brinkmanship .
but frontal assaults , usually carried out by two-man teams firing semi-automatic rifles and lobbing grenades , were the favoured tactic of the insurgency in indian-administered kashmir between 1999 and 2003 .
fidayeen technique scores of such attacks were carried out by " fidayeen " -lrb- literally " death-defying " -rrb- squads in indian-administered kashmir during that period .
ahmedabad saw rioting after the gujarat killings in 2002 in many instances , these attacks led to confrontations lasting anywhere between 24 and 72 hours between the raiders and security forces , who were often constrained by the presence of trapped civilians .
most of the locations targeted were indian military and police installations in the kashmir valley , particularly in the regional capital srinagar .
but some attacks targeted civilians , especially in and around the hindu-majority city of jammu , in the southern part of indian-administered kashmir .
the perpetrators were not members of the main homegrown kashmiri insurgent group , the hizb-ul mujahideen -lrb- " warriors of the faith " -rrb- .
the fidayeen technique - a rudimentary form of " shock and awe " warfare - was introduced into kashmir by pakistani radical organisations that entered the kashmir insurgency from the mid-1990s onwards .
the large majority of fidayeen attacks in kashmir were perpetrated by one such organisation , the lashkar-e-toiba , headquartered in pakistan and founded and led by pakistani religious radicals .
the lashkar-e toiba did over time recruit a handful of local kashmiris as fidayeen cadre , but most of the attackers were pakistani nationals who had crossed into indian-administered kashmir .
fidayeen attacks have died down in kashmir since india-pakistan relations thawed from 2004 onward .
but the deployment of exactly the same tactic in central mumbai shows that this technique has now found a new and even more dangerous theatre in which to operate .
method the tactic is thus not without precedent , but the mayhem in mumbai may nonetheless mark a new chapter in the evolution of urban terrorism in india .
bombs planted in markets and on commuter trains kill and maim working-class and middle-class indians .
the gunmen who attacked two luxury hotels , and a fashionable cafe frequented by visiting westerners , have brought the " war " - as they see it - to india 's elite class , and to affluent westerners living in or visiting india 's most cosmopolitan city .
if reports that the gunmen specifically looked for american and british citizens to take hostage are true , it would suggest that this terrorist spectacular had little to do with the prejudice and discrimination many muslims do encounter in india .
it is tempting to label the attackers as " crazies " .
but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced .
it is more than likely that the masterminds are seasoned operatives and that the foot-soldiers , young as they may have been , had undergone rigorous training for months , perhaps years .
the attacks also show every sign of having been designed to maximise media attention on a global scale .
in other words , there is a method to the madness .

the obvious novelty is the use of frontal assault tactics instead of timed explosive devices .
this is new in the urban indian context .
there was one notable exception - an attack by a five-man squad armed with rifles and grenades on india 's parliament in new delhi in december 2001 .
the attackers were narrowly prevented by alert staff from gaining access to the building , where hundreds of parliamentarians and ministers were attending a session .
they were gunned down near the entrance by security personnel after an hour-long battle .
nine guards and parliament stewards also died .
this attack led to the crisis of 2002 between india and pakistan .
the indian government blamed pakistani religious radicals , and embarked on a major military build-up on the border with pakistan , to which pakistan responded with its own mobilisation .
the stand-off eventually wound down later in 2002 after months of tension and brinkmanship .
but frontal assaults , usually carried out by two-man teams firing semi-automatic rifles and lobbing grenades , were the favoured tactic of the insurgency in indian-administered kashmir between 1999 and 2003 .
fidayeen technique scores of such attacks were carried out by " fidayeen " -lrb- literally " death-defying " -rrb- squads in indian-administered kashmir during that period .
ahmedabad saw rioting after the gujarat killings in 2002 in many instances , these attacks led to confrontations lasting anywhere between 24 and 72 hours between the raiders and security forces , who were often constrained by the presence of trapped civilians .
most of the locations targeted were indian military and police installations in the kashmir valley , particularly in the regional capital srinagar .
but some attacks targeted civilians , especially in and around the hindu-majority city of jammu , in the southern part of indian-administered kashmir .
the perpetrators were not members of the main homegrown kashmiri insurgent group , the hizb-ul mujahideen -lrb- " warriors of the faith " -rrb- .
the fidayeen technique - a rudimentary form of " shock and awe " warfare - was introduced into kashmir by pakistani radical organisations that entered the kashmir insurgency from the mid-1990s onwards .
the large majority of fidayeen attacks in kashmir were perpetrated by one such organisation , the lashkar-e-toiba , headquartered in pakistan and founded and led by pakistani religious radicals .
the lashkar-e toiba did over time recruit a handful of local kashmiris as fidayeen cadre , but most of the attackers were pakistani nationals who had crossed into indian-administered kashmir .
fidayeen attacks have died down in kashmir since india-pakistan relations thawed from 2004 onward .
but the deployment of exactly the same tactic in central mumbai shows that this technique has now found a new and even more dangerous theatre in which to operate .
method the tactic is thus not without precedent , but the mayhem in mumbai may nonetheless mark a new chapter in the evolution of urban terrorism in india .
bombs planted in markets and on commuter trains kill and maim working-class and middle-class indians .
the gunmen who attacked two luxury hotels , and a fashionable cafe frequented by visiting westerners , have brought the " war " - as they see it - to india 's elite class , and to affluent westerners living in or visiting india 's most cosmopolitan city .
if reports that the gunmen specifically looked for american and british citizens to take hostage are true , it would suggest that this terrorist spectacular had little to do with the prejudice and discrimination many muslims do encounter in india .
it is tempting to label the attackers as " crazies " .
but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced .
it is more than likely that the masterminds are seasoned operatives and that the foot-soldiers , young as they may have been , had undergone rigorous training for months , perhaps years .
the attacks also show every sign of having been designed to maximise media attention on a global scale .
in other words , there is a method to the madness .

such attacks have occurred regularly , and with steadily increasing frequency , in recent years .
mumbai , india 's financial capital , has been targeted before .
in march 1993 , a series of car bombs were detonated at public landmarks across the city , including the stock exchange , killing 257 people .
those attacks , in which the city 's underworld played a key role , followed hindu-muslim violence in the city during december 1992 and january 1993 .
working-class muslims were the principal victims , often shot at point-blank range by members of the city 's police force .
in july 2006 , a series of bombs planted on mumbai 's commuter train network killed 183 people .
other indian cities have been regularly targeted as well , particularly delhi , the capital .
in october 2005 bombs exploded in crowded delhi markets on the eve of the festive day diwali , the festival of lights .
more than 60 people were killed .
most recently , in july 2008 , bombs exploded at a number of congested public locations in ahmedabad , the capital of the western state of gujarat .
india 's parliament was attacked in 2001 , leaving nine people dead .
gujarat , one of india 's most prosperous states , saw large-scale killings of muslims in 2002 after an arson attack on a train in the state killed 59 hindu nationalist activists .
more than 50 people were killed in the ahmedabad bombings .
a previously unknown group , the indian mujahideen , claimed responsibility .
the ahmedabad attacks were particularly vicious in that bombs were detonated outside the emergency facilities of city hospitals just as people injured in other explosions were being brought in by ambulances .

such attacks have occurred regularly , and with steadily increasing frequency , in recent years .
mumbai , india 's financial capital , has been targeted before .
in march 1993 , a series of car bombs were detonated at public landmarks across the city , including the stock exchange , killing 257 people .
those attacks , in which the city 's underworld played a key role , followed hindu-muslim violence in the city during december 1992 and january 1993 .
working-class muslims were the principal victims , often shot at point-blank range by members of the city 's police force .
in july 2006 , a series of bombs planted on mumbai 's commuter train network killed 183 people .
other indian cities have been regularly targeted as well , particularly delhi , the capital .
in october 2005 bombs exploded in crowded delhi markets on the eve of the festive day diwali , the festival of lights .
more than 60 people were killed .
most recently , in july 2008 , bombs exploded at a number of congested public locations in ahmedabad , the capital of the western state of gujarat .
india 's parliament was attacked in 2001 , leaving nine people dead .
gujarat , one of india 's most prosperous states , saw large-scale killings of muslims in 2002 after an arson attack on a train in the state killed 59 hindu nationalist activists .
more than 50 people were killed in the ahmedabad bombings .
a previously unknown group , the indian mujahideen , claimed responsibility .
the ahmedabad attacks were particularly vicious in that bombs were detonated outside the emergency facilities of city hospitals just as people injured in other explosions were being brought in by ambulances .
frontal assault so what is new about mumbai , november 2008 ?
it is tempting to label the attackers as ' crazies ' - but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced sumantra bose mumbai : a pakistan militant link ?
the obvious novelty is the use of frontal assault tactics instead of timed explosive devices .
this is new in the urban indian context .
there was one notable exception - an attack by a five-man squad armed with rifles and grenades on india 's parliament in new delhi in december 2001 .
the attackers were narrowly prevented by alert staff from gaining access to the building , where hundreds of parliamentarians and ministers were attending a session .
they were gunned down near the entrance by security personnel after an hour-long battle .
nine guards and parliament stewards also died .
this attack led to the crisis of 2002 between india and pakistan .
the indian government blamed pakistani religious radicals , and embarked on a major military build-up on the border with pakistan , to which pakistan responded with its own mobilisation .
the stand-off eventually wound down later in 2002 after months of tension and brinkmanship .
but frontal assaults , usually carried out by two-man teams firing semi-automatic rifles and lobbing grenades , were the favoured tactic of the insurgency in indian-administered kashmir between 1999 and 2003 .
fidayeen technique scores of such attacks were carried out by " fidayeen " -lrb- literally " death-defying " -rrb- squads in indian-administered kashmir during that period .
ahmedabad saw rioting after the gujarat killings in 2002 in many instances , these attacks led to confrontations lasting anywhere between 24 and 72 hours between the raiders and security forces , who were often constrained by the presence of trapped civilians .
most of the locations targeted were indian military and police installations in the kashmir valley , particularly in the regional capital srinagar .
but some attacks targeted civilians , especially in and around the hindu-majority city of jammu , in the southern part of indian-administered kashmir .
the perpetrators were not members of the main homegrown kashmiri insurgent group , the hizb-ul mujahideen -lrb- " warriors of the faith " -rrb- .
the fidayeen technique - a rudimentary form of " shock and awe " warfare - was introduced into kashmir by pakistani radical organisations that entered the kashmir insurgency from the mid-1990s onwards .
the large majority of fidayeen attacks in kashmir were perpetrated by one such organisation , the lashkar-e-toiba , headquartered in pakistan and founded and led by pakistani religious radicals .
the lashkar-e toiba did over time recruit a handful of local kashmiris as fidayeen cadre , but most of the attackers were pakistani nationals who had crossed into indian-administered kashmir .
fidayeen attacks have died down in kashmir since india-pakistan relations thawed from 2004 onward .
but the deployment of exactly the same tactic in central mumbai shows that this technique has now found a new and even more dangerous theatre in which to operate .
method the tactic is thus not without precedent , but the mayhem in mumbai may nonetheless mark a new chapter in the evolution of urban terrorism in india .
bombs planted in markets and on commuter trains kill and maim working-class and middle-class indians .
the gunmen who attacked two luxury hotels , and a fashionable cafe frequented by visiting westerners , have brought the " war " - as they see it - to india 's elite class , and to affluent westerners living in or visiting india 's most cosmopolitan city .
if reports that the gunmen specifically looked for american and british citizens to take hostage are true , it would suggest that this terrorist spectacular had little to do with the prejudice and discrimination many muslims do encounter in india .
it is tempting to label the attackers as " crazies " .
but such a dismissive appellation may be misplaced .
it is more than likely that the masterminds are seasoned operatives and that the foot-soldiers , young as they may have been , had undergone rigorous training for months , perhaps years .
the attacks also show every sign of having been designed to maximise media attention on a global scale .
in other words , there is a method to the madness .
sumantra bose is professor of international and comparative politics at the london school of economics .

a welsh couple who were caught up in the shooting attacks in mumbai have arrived home in the uk .
lynne and ken shaw landed at heathrow airport at around 0700 gmt on friday on a flight arranged by the british consulate .
mrs shaw had to hide under a table as attackers stormed the taj mahal palace hotel .
she and her husband , from penarth , were later rescued by gurkhas .
their family has travelled to the airport to welcome them home .
at least 130 people have been killed and 300 injured after gunmen targeted at least seven sites in the indian city late on wednesday .
speaking before the couple arrived in the uk , mrs shaw 's sister , louise booker , said they were " relieved " after finding out the couple were heading home and that she was looking forward to seeing them at the airport .
she said they had had to watch the 24-hour news coverage to try to find out what was happening after their mother received a brief phone call from mrs shaw as she hid under a table .
my heart goes out to all the other people who have n't had the good news we have had louise booker " all she was able to say was that she was able to make one phone call and she was under the table in the hotel and that there had been a bomb and firing and that she was very frightened but she was okay .
and at that stage that was all we knew , " she said .
she said it was " agonising " watching news coverage , not sure what had happened to the couple they eventually received another phone call from mrs shaw to say they were safe .
" all she was able to say was that they were eventually asked to come out with their hands on their heads and that she said even at that stage they did n't know who was bringing them out until they saw the ghurkhas , " said ms booker .
" she said then she breathed a sigh of relief .
but then they had to make a run for the bus and even as the bus was leaving the area there were shots being fired .
they were taken straight to the australian embassy and safety . "

damian green told reporters he was astonished by his arrest conservative immigration spokesman damian green has been arrested and released on bail in connection with a series of leaks from the home office .
police say mr green was held on suspicion of " conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office " .
the mp denied any wrongdoing and said " opposition politicians have a duty to hold the government to account " and that he would " continue to do so " .
he was questioned , but has not been charged and was bailed until february .
mr green 's arrest is believed to be connected to the arrest of a man suspected of being a home office whistleblower .
speaking outside the house of commons , mr green said : " i was astonished to have spent more than nine hours today under arrest for doing my job .
' right to know ' " i emphatically deny i have done anything wrong .
i have many times made public information that the government wanted to keep secret - information that the public has a right to know .
" in a democracy , opposition politicians have a duty to hold the government to account .
" i was elected to the house of commons precisely to do that and i certainly intend to continue doing so . "
the bbc understands that a junior home office official was suspended from duty 10 days ago over a number of leaks and the matter was referred to police .
he was arrested but not charged .
it follows a series of leaks , including : the november 2007 revelation that the home secretary knew the security industry authority had granted licences to 5,000 illegal workers , but decided not to publicise it .
the february 2008 news that an illegal immigrant had been employed as a cleaner in the house of commons .
a whips ' list of potential labour rebels in the vote on plans to increase the pre-charge terror detention limit to 42 days .
a letter from the home secretary warning that a recession could lead to a rise in crime .
the bbc understands tory leader david cameron is angry about what has happened and stands by mr green .
' big questions ' speaking on bbc one 's question time , shadow chancellor george osborne said : " i think it 's absolutely extraordinary that the police have taken that decision .
" it has long been the case in our democracy that mps have received information from civil servants - i think to hide information from the public is wrong .
disclosure of this information was manifestly in the public interest conservative party profile : damian green " it is early days , it 's an extraordinary case .
i think there are going to be some very , very big questions asked of the police . "
a spokesman for the conservative party said mr green had " on a number of occasions , legitimately revealed information which the home office chose not to make public .
" disclosure of this information was manifestly in the public interest .
" mr green denies any wrongdoing and stands by his actions . "
conservative sources said a police investigation into a high-ranking politician would have to have been cleared at " the very top " and have described the actions as " stalinesque " .
' no prior knowledge ' but a downing street spokesman said : " this is a matter for the police .
the prime minister had no prior knowledge of the arrest of mr green and was only informed after the event . "
mayor of london boris johnson has said he was informed in advance of the met 's plan to arrest mr green , and expressed " trenchant " concerns about the move .
mr green , the mp for ashford in kent , who has been the conservatives ' immigration spokesman since december 2005 , was arrested shortly before 1400 gmt at his constituency home .
the tories say they understand counter-terrorism officers were involved in searches of his home and offices .
london mayor boris johnson said he had been warned of the arrest in a statement , the met said the arrest was made without any ministerial influence .
they said : " the investigation into the alleged leak of confidential government material followed the receipt by the metropolitan police service -lrb- mps -rrb- of a complaint from the cabinet office .
" the decision to make today 's arrest was taken solely by the mps without any ministerial knowledge or approval . "
it said search warrants had been carried out at a home in kent , a home in west london , business premises in kent and in central london " the search at the residential address in west london has concluded , the other searches continue , " it added .
a home office spokesman confirmed that a home office official had been arrested last week " in connection with an inquiry into alleged leaked documents " .
