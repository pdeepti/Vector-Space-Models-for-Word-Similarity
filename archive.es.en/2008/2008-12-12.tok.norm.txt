program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 12.12.2008 bayern , hoffenheim battle for winter bragging rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's talisman vedad ibisevic will need to be on target this weekend leaders hoffenheim and champions bayern munich are vying to end the year top of the bundesliga before german league football takes its winter break . bayern travel to stuttgart on saturday in a sentimental journey for coach juergen klinsmann , while hoffenheim are at home to schalke 04 on sunday in the battle for the honour of " autumn champions . "
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .
olic transfer rumours bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could be bayern bound hamburg are in a fight to keep striker ivica olic who is being courted by several clubs including bayern munich .
the 29-year-old croatian could leave on a free transfer at the end of the season , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said late wednesday : " our cards are n't so bad .
he is a forward who would fit in well with us . "

outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .

confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .
olic transfer rumours bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could be bayern bound hamburg are in a fight to keep striker ivica olic who is being courted by several clubs including bayern munich .
the 29-year-old croatian could leave on a free transfer at the end of the season , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said late wednesday : " our cards are n't so bad .
he is a forward who would fit in well with us . "

but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "
germany 's stance irking european partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown and sarkozy have criticized germany 's caution germany has faced intense pressure from british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso to boost domestic consumption , but has refused to indulge in borrowing and deficit spending .
brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
because some governments can not afford to make a very big contribution to the eu stimulus effort , some countries will have to put much more in than the average contribution .
of the stimulus target of 1.5 percent of gdp , 1.2 percent is supposed to consist of various national measures .
almunia said governments have so far committed less than that , with all the national measures adding up to only 0.8-0.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .

mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.12.2008 opinion : only international community can ensure mugabe 's fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action , not words is what 's needed now in zimbabwe , says schaeffer zimbabwe 's ruler robert mugabe is destroying his country and trampling human rights as the international community looks on .
it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?

but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .

it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .

why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "
germany 's stance irking european partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown and sarkozy have criticized germany 's caution germany has faced intense pressure from british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso to boost domestic consumption , but has refused to indulge in borrowing and deficit spending .
brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
because some governments can not afford to make a very big contribution to the eu stimulus effort , some countries will have to put much more in than the average contribution .
of the stimulus target of 1.5 percent of gdp , 1.2 percent is supposed to consist of various national measures .
almunia said governments have so far committed less than that , with all the national measures adding up to only 0.8-0.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "
germany 's stance irking european partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown and sarkozy have criticized germany 's caution germany has faced intense pressure from british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso to boost domestic consumption , but has refused to indulge in borrowing and deficit spending .
brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
because some governments can not afford to make a very big contribution to the eu stimulus effort , some countries will have to put much more in than the average contribution .
of the stimulus target of 1.5 percent of gdp , 1.2 percent is supposed to consist of various national measures .
almunia said governments have so far committed less than that , with all the national measures adding up to only 0.8-0.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de britain , germany trade criticisms in growing financial row angela merkel may have shrugged off the apparent snub of not being invited to monday ’ s mini-summit between britain and france but it is unlikely that new comments from the british government will be dismissed as easily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.12.2008 merkel agrees to eu 's multi-billion-euro bailout despite doubts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has been under increasing pressure to tow the eu line on economic issues german leader angela merkel is giving her backing to a 200-billion-euro plan to dig europe out of recession after her finance minister said tossing money around would only increase the debt burden . as eu leaders gathered in brussels for a summit , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck added to simmering tensions over the europe-wide stimulus plan by offering up a withering criticism of britain 's economic policy .
but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "
germany 's stance irking european partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown and sarkozy have criticized germany 's caution germany has faced intense pressure from british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso to boost domestic consumption , but has refused to indulge in borrowing and deficit spending .
brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
because some governments can not afford to make a very big contribution to the eu stimulus effort , some countries will have to put much more in than the average contribution .
of the stimulus target of 1.5 percent of gdp , 1.2 percent is supposed to consist of various national measures .
almunia said governments have so far committed less than that , with all the national measures adding up to only 0.8-0.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de britain , germany trade criticisms in growing financial row angela merkel may have shrugged off the apparent snub of not being invited to monday ’ s mini-summit between britain and france but it is unlikely that new comments from the british government will be dismissed as easily .

as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .
" if one of the big auto companies goes bust in the us , this could see a collapse in the entire supply chain , " said heino ruland , a strategist at frankfurt finanza .
' too early to tell ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german carmakers ' shares were hit when the us auto bailout was rejected german auto industry association vda said there was still a chance the us senate could readdress the auto bailout package .
" therefore it is premature to speculate about the actual consequences for german carmakers and their suppliers , " the association said .
" today , the main thing is the uncertainty around the auto industry and whether or not it will go bust , " said bernard mcalinden , strategist at ncb stockbrokers , as quoted by news agency reuters .
nonetheless , worries over gm saw the company 's share price in frankfurt drop 37 percent by midday friday , dec .
12 .
shares in bmw were down 4.14 percent , volkswagon dropped 2.18 percent and daimler shed 7.93 percent .
parts suppliers fearful of slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car parts producers are having liquidation problems concerns were also stoked in the european auto parts industry as carmakers experienced slumping sales due to low-consumer confidence and the credit crunch .
this decreased demand has led to german automakers such as opel , daimler , bmw and vw cutting or considering cutting output levels , which means parts suppliers could be hit hard further down the chain .
to add to their woes , auto industry companies such as parts producers have been reclassified by banks as high-risk loan applicants , further drying up cash flows and increasing the possibility of redundancies .
" the outlook is like this : nobody knows what is going to happen … but we think we will produce 30 or 40 percent less next year compared to this year , " said elmar holzaepfel , whose company eugen klein gelenkwellen makes drive-shafts for truckmakers man , iveco , daf and daimler .
in germany , around one in five in the workforce is employed either directly or indirectly in the auto sector .
the car parts industry is a key link in this chain , without which millions of jobs would be at stake .
" if the supply chain breaks , that will have a dramatic impact on the whole automotive industry in germany and the employees in this key sector , " vda president matthias wissmann said .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .

" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .

12 in new clashes that first broke out over the police killing of a teenager a week ago . students , angry at the shooting incident , low wages and unemployment , attacked police outside the parliament building on a seventh day of violence that has shaken the government .
riot police fired teargas in response .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .
greece 's debt almost equals its economic output .
economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .
police sources say they are running out of teargas after using more than 4,600 capsules in the last week and have urgently contacted israel and germany for more stocks .
" everyone wants this government of murderers to fall .
the government in four years has only carried out reforms against students , " said maria tsoupri , 22 .
" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .
greeks rushing to work on friday were keen for their cities to return to normal after the protests , which the greek commerce confederation said caused 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265.3 million -rrb- of damage to more than 500 shops in athens alone .
several schools and universities remained occupied by students and professors formed a human chain around the main university building to protect it from further damage .
" it will become calm now .
but i want the government to clean up , to get the market and the economy moving , " said isidoros aletas , 21 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .
policeman claims self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and rioting throughout greece has been fierce korkoneas is accused of killing grigoropoulos during a clash with around 30 youths in the exarchia district of athens .
the police officer has claimed self defense .
his lawyers said a ballistics analysis indicated the bullet had ricocheted before hitting the schoolboy .
korkoneas 's partner , vassilios saraliotis , 31 , was charged with being an accomplice and will also remain in custody .
fresh rallies new student rallies were planned for friday and monday .
on thursday , the sixth day of demonstrations , about 4,000 students took to the streets in athens in a protest that turned increasingly violent .
demonstrators clashed with security forces near the country 's biggest prison and a university in central athens .
crowds threw rocks and other missiles at police , who retaliated using tear gas , a prison guard said .
attacks on stores in several other areas and road blockades were also reported .
more than 400 businesses have been hit by the rioting , with 37 completely gutted .
the damage in athens alone was worth about 200 million euros -lrb- $ 259 million -rrb- , according to the greek commerce confederation .
anger at government reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests spread around europe as greek consulates came under fire the athens clashes paralleled similar events in other greek cities and throughout europe as anger was focused against greek consulates .
analysts say the severity of the violence was caused by long-simmering discontent with the government over a series of financial scandals and unpopular economic , pension and education reforms .
the shooting of grigoropoulos was seen as the last straw by many young greeks , whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment and low wages . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .

just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .

" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.12.2008 opinion : only international community can ensure mugabe 's fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action , not words is what 's needed now in zimbabwe , says schaeffer zimbabwe 's ruler robert mugabe is destroying his country and trampling human rights as the international community looks on .
it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .

this decreased demand has led to german automakers such as opel , daimler , bmw and vw cutting or considering cutting output levels , which means parts suppliers could be hit hard further down the chain .
to add to their woes , auto industry companies such as parts producers have been reclassified by banks as high-risk loan applicants , further drying up cash flows and increasing the possibility of redundancies .

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .
" if one of the big auto companies goes bust in the us , this could see a collapse in the entire supply chain , " said heino ruland , a strategist at frankfurt finanza .
' too early to tell ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german carmakers ' shares were hit when the us auto bailout was rejected german auto industry association vda said there was still a chance the us senate could readdress the auto bailout package .
" therefore it is premature to speculate about the actual consequences for german carmakers and their suppliers , " the association said .
" today , the main thing is the uncertainty around the auto industry and whether or not it will go bust , " said bernard mcalinden , strategist at ncb stockbrokers , as quoted by news agency reuters .
nonetheless , worries over gm saw the company 's share price in frankfurt drop 37 percent by midday friday , dec .
12 .
shares in bmw were down 4.14 percent , volkswagon dropped 2.18 percent and daimler shed 7.93 percent .
parts suppliers fearful of slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car parts producers are having liquidation problems concerns were also stoked in the european auto parts industry as carmakers experienced slumping sales due to low-consumer confidence and the credit crunch .
this decreased demand has led to german automakers such as opel , daimler , bmw and vw cutting or considering cutting output levels , which means parts suppliers could be hit hard further down the chain .
to add to their woes , auto industry companies such as parts producers have been reclassified by banks as high-risk loan applicants , further drying up cash flows and increasing the possibility of redundancies .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .
policeman claims self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and rioting throughout greece has been fierce korkoneas is accused of killing grigoropoulos during a clash with around 30 youths in the exarchia district of athens .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "
germany 's stance irking european partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown and sarkozy have criticized germany 's caution germany has faced intense pressure from british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso to boost domestic consumption , but has refused to indulge in borrowing and deficit spending .
brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
because some governments can not afford to make a very big contribution to the eu stimulus effort , some countries will have to put much more in than the average contribution .
of the stimulus target of 1.5 percent of gdp , 1.2 percent is supposed to consist of various national measures .
almunia said governments have so far committed less than that , with all the national measures adding up to only 0.8-0.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de britain , germany trade criticisms in growing financial row angela merkel may have shrugged off the apparent snub of not being invited to monday ’ s mini-summit between britain and france but it is unlikely that new comments from the british government will be dismissed as easily .
-lrb- 11.12.2008 -rrb- merkel faces cold shoulder in brussels as eu leaders gather germany 's chancellor angela merkel faces a chilly reception at this week 's european union summit in brussels after steadfastly resisting calls to drastically boost government spending as an antidote to recession .

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .
policeman claims self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and rioting throughout greece has been fierce korkoneas is accused of killing grigoropoulos during a clash with around 30 youths in the exarchia district of athens .
the police officer has claimed self defense .
his lawyers said a ballistics analysis indicated the bullet had ricocheted before hitting the schoolboy .
korkoneas 's partner , vassilios saraliotis , 31 , was charged with being an accomplice and will also remain in custody .
fresh rallies new student rallies were planned for friday and monday .
on thursday , the sixth day of demonstrations , about 4,000 students took to the streets in athens in a protest that turned increasingly violent .
demonstrators clashed with security forces near the country 's biggest prison and a university in central athens .
crowds threw rocks and other missiles at police , who retaliated using tear gas , a prison guard said .
attacks on stores in several other areas and road blockades were also reported .
more than 400 businesses have been hit by the rioting , with 37 completely gutted .
the damage in athens alone was worth about 200 million euros -lrb- $ 259 million -rrb- , according to the greek commerce confederation .
anger at government reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests spread around europe as greek consulates came under fire the athens clashes paralleled similar events in other greek cities and throughout europe as anger was focused against greek consulates .
analysts say the severity of the violence was caused by long-simmering discontent with the government over a series of financial scandals and unpopular economic , pension and education reforms .
the shooting of grigoropoulos was seen as the last straw by many young greeks , whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment and low wages . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .

the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .

" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .

steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "

brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .
" if one of the big auto companies goes bust in the us , this could see a collapse in the entire supply chain , " said heino ruland , a strategist at frankfurt finanza .
' too early to tell ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german carmakers ' shares were hit when the us auto bailout was rejected german auto industry association vda said there was still a chance the us senate could readdress the auto bailout package .
" therefore it is premature to speculate about the actual consequences for german carmakers and their suppliers , " the association said .
" today , the main thing is the uncertainty around the auto industry and whether or not it will go bust , " said bernard mcalinden , strategist at ncb stockbrokers , as quoted by news agency reuters .
nonetheless , worries over gm saw the company 's share price in frankfurt drop 37 percent by midday friday , dec .
12 .
shares in bmw were down 4.14 percent , volkswagon dropped 2.18 percent and daimler shed 7.93 percent .
parts suppliers fearful of slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car parts producers are having liquidation problems concerns were also stoked in the european auto parts industry as carmakers experienced slumping sales due to low-consumer confidence and the credit crunch .
this decreased demand has led to german automakers such as opel , daimler , bmw and vw cutting or considering cutting output levels , which means parts suppliers could be hit hard further down the chain .
to add to their woes , auto industry companies such as parts producers have been reclassified by banks as high-risk loan applicants , further drying up cash flows and increasing the possibility of redundancies .
" the outlook is like this : nobody knows what is going to happen … but we think we will produce 30 or 40 percent less next year compared to this year , " said elmar holzaepfel , whose company eugen klein gelenkwellen makes drive-shafts for truckmakers man , iveco , daf and daimler .
in germany , around one in five in the workforce is employed either directly or indirectly in the auto sector .
the car parts industry is a key link in this chain , without which millions of jobs would be at stake .
" if the supply chain breaks , that will have a dramatic impact on the whole automotive industry in germany and the employees in this key sector , " vda president matthias wissmann said .

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .
policeman claims self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and rioting throughout greece has been fierce korkoneas is accused of killing grigoropoulos during a clash with around 30 youths in the exarchia district of athens .
the police officer has claimed self defense .
his lawyers said a ballistics analysis indicated the bullet had ricocheted before hitting the schoolboy .
korkoneas 's partner , vassilios saraliotis , 31 , was charged with being an accomplice and will also remain in custody .
fresh rallies new student rallies were planned for friday and monday .
on thursday , the sixth day of demonstrations , about 4,000 students took to the streets in athens in a protest that turned increasingly violent .
demonstrators clashed with security forces near the country 's biggest prison and a university in central athens .
crowds threw rocks and other missiles at police , who retaliated using tear gas , a prison guard said .
attacks on stores in several other areas and road blockades were also reported .
more than 400 businesses have been hit by the rioting , with 37 completely gutted .
the damage in athens alone was worth about 200 million euros -lrb- $ 259 million -rrb- , according to the greek commerce confederation .
anger at government reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests spread around europe as greek consulates came under fire the athens clashes paralleled similar events in other greek cities and throughout europe as anger was focused against greek consulates .
analysts say the severity of the violence was caused by long-simmering discontent with the government over a series of financial scandals and unpopular economic , pension and education reforms .
the shooting of grigoropoulos was seen as the last straw by many young greeks , whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment and low wages . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .

" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .
olic transfer rumours bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could be bayern bound hamburg are in a fight to keep striker ivica olic who is being courted by several clubs including bayern munich .
the 29-year-old croatian could leave on a free transfer at the end of the season , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said late wednesday : " our cards are n't so bad .
he is a forward who would fit in well with us . "

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .

the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .

brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .

now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 12.12.2008 bayern , hoffenheim battle for winter bragging rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim 's talisman vedad ibisevic will need to be on target this weekend leaders hoffenheim and champions bayern munich are vying to end the year top of the bundesliga before german league football takes its winter break . bayern travel to stuttgart on saturday in a sentimental journey for coach juergen klinsmann , while hoffenheim are at home to schalke 04 on sunday in the battle for the honour of " autumn champions . "
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .
stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .
olic transfer rumours bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could be bayern bound hamburg are in a fight to keep striker ivica olic who is being courted by several clubs including bayern munich .
the 29-year-old croatian could leave on a free transfer at the end of the season , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said late wednesday : " our cards are n't so bad .
he is a forward who would fit in well with us . "

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .

to add to their woes , auto industry companies such as parts producers have been reclassified by banks as high-risk loan applicants , further drying up cash flows and increasing the possibility of redundancies .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel , which is owned by gm , was not affected by the failure of the us auto bailout , but is nonetheless counting on funding guarantees from the german government to help it endure the current economic downturn .
the german government has told opel that any financial assistance comes with the non-negotiable requirement that the funding not find its way back to parent company gm , which has warned it faces a total collapse without us government assistance .
a fear is that if one of the big three goes bankrupt , it could have irreversibly negative consequences for the global auto industry .
" if one of the big auto companies goes bust in the us , this could see a collapse in the entire supply chain , " said heino ruland , a strategist at frankfurt finanza .
' too early to tell ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german carmakers ' shares were hit when the us auto bailout was rejected german auto industry association vda said there was still a chance the us senate could readdress the auto bailout package .
" therefore it is premature to speculate about the actual consequences for german carmakers and their suppliers , " the association said .
" today , the main thing is the uncertainty around the auto industry and whether or not it will go bust , " said bernard mcalinden , strategist at ncb stockbrokers , as quoted by news agency reuters .
nonetheless , worries over gm saw the company 's share price in frankfurt drop 37 percent by midday friday , dec .
12 .
shares in bmw were down 4.14 percent , volkswagon dropped 2.18 percent and daimler shed 7.93 percent .
parts suppliers fearful of slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car parts producers are having liquidation problems concerns were also stoked in the european auto parts industry as carmakers experienced slumping sales due to low-consumer confidence and the credit crunch .
this decreased demand has led to german automakers such as opel , daimler , bmw and vw cutting or considering cutting output levels , which means parts suppliers could be hit hard further down the chain .
to add to their woes , auto industry companies such as parts producers have been reclassified by banks as high-risk loan applicants , further drying up cash flows and increasing the possibility of redundancies .
" the outlook is like this : nobody knows what is going to happen … but we think we will produce 30 or 40 percent less next year compared to this year , " said elmar holzaepfel , whose company eugen klein gelenkwellen makes drive-shafts for truckmakers man , iveco , daf and daimler .
in germany , around one in five in the workforce is employed either directly or indirectly in the auto sector .
the car parts industry is a key link in this chain , without which millions of jobs would be at stake .
" if the supply chain breaks , that will have a dramatic impact on the whole automotive industry in germany and the employees in this key sector , " vda president matthias wissmann said .

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .
confidence is high at bayern whose 3-2 win at olympique lyon in the champions league on wednesday evening extends to 15 their run of games without defeat in all competitions .

now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .

mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .

" this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.12.2008 mugabe declares cholera outbreak over as pressure increases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is under increasing international pressure to step down as president of zimbabwe in an apparent bid to end calls for international intervention against his regime , zimbabwean president robert mugabe has claimed that the cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 800 people since august is over . " britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 in new clashes that first broke out over the police killing of a teenager a week ago . students , angry at the shooting incident , low wages and unemployment , attacked police outside the parliament building on a seventh day of violence that has shaken the government .
riot police fired teargas in response .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .
greece 's debt almost equals its economic output .
economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .
police sources say they are running out of teargas after using more than 4,600 capsules in the last week and have urgently contacted israel and germany for more stocks .
" everyone wants this government of murderers to fall .
the government in four years has only carried out reforms against students , " said maria tsoupri , 22 .
" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .
greeks rushing to work on friday were keen for their cities to return to normal after the protests , which the greek commerce confederation said caused 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265.3 million -rrb- of damage to more than 500 shops in athens alone .
several schools and universities remained occupied by students and professors formed a human chain around the main university building to protect it from further damage .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .

the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .

according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .

steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

" it 's over with .
i dread looking at wall street tomorrow .
it 's not going to be a pleasant sight , " said senate majority leader harry reid , a democrat .
reid later said there would be " no more work " on the bailout until the " reconvening of the new congress next year . "
bad christmas for many the house of representatives approved the emergency loan wednesday night , imposing strict oversight rules in exchange for keeping gm and chrysler out of bankruptcy at least until april and extending a hefty line of credit to ford .

" millions of americans , not only the autoworkers , but people who sell cars , car dealerships , people who work on cars , are going to be directly impacted , " said reid .
" it 's going to be a very , very bad christmas for a lot of people . "
fears stoked , stocks down the failure of the auto bailout to pass through the senate precipitated heavy losses on wall street and in asia , and caused european shares to open sharply lower .
in london , the ftse 100 index of leading shares was down 1.21 percent at 4,335.46 points in early trade .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .

according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .

steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .

brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "

12 in new clashes that first broke out over the police killing of a teenager a week ago . students , angry at the shooting incident , low wages and unemployment , attacked police outside the parliament building on a seventh day of violence that has shaken the government .
riot police fired teargas in response .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .

economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .
police sources say they are running out of teargas after using more than 4,600 capsules in the last week and have urgently contacted israel and germany for more stocks .
" everyone wants this government of murderers to fall .
the government in four years has only carried out reforms against students , " said maria tsoupri , 22 .
" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .
greeks rushing to work on friday were keen for their cities to return to normal after the protests , which the greek commerce confederation said caused 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265.3 million -rrb- of damage to more than 500 shops in athens alone .
several schools and universities remained occupied by students and professors formed a human chain around the main university building to protect it from further damage .

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .
greece 's debt almost equals its economic output .
economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .
police sources say they are running out of teargas after using more than 4,600 capsules in the last week and have urgently contacted israel and germany for more stocks .
" everyone wants this government of murderers to fall .
the government in four years has only carried out reforms against students , " said maria tsoupri , 22 .
" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .
greeks rushing to work on friday were keen for their cities to return to normal after the protests , which the greek commerce confederation said caused 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265.3 million -rrb- of damage to more than 500 shops in athens alone .
several schools and universities remained occupied by students and professors formed a human chain around the main university building to protect it from further damage .
" it will become calm now .
but i want the government to clean up , to get the market and the economy moving , " said isidoros aletas , 21 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .
policeman claims self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and rioting throughout greece has been fierce korkoneas is accused of killing grigoropoulos during a clash with around 30 youths in the exarchia district of athens .
the police officer has claimed self defense .
his lawyers said a ballistics analysis indicated the bullet had ricocheted before hitting the schoolboy .
korkoneas 's partner , vassilios saraliotis , 31 , was charged with being an accomplice and will also remain in custody .
fresh rallies new student rallies were planned for friday and monday .
on thursday , the sixth day of demonstrations , about 4,000 students took to the streets in athens in a protest that turned increasingly violent .
demonstrators clashed with security forces near the country 's biggest prison and a university in central athens .
crowds threw rocks and other missiles at police , who retaliated using tear gas , a prison guard said .
attacks on stores in several other areas and road blockades were also reported .
more than 400 businesses have been hit by the rioting , with 37 completely gutted .
the damage in athens alone was worth about 200 million euros -lrb- $ 259 million -rrb- , according to the greek commerce confederation .
anger at government reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests spread around europe as greek consulates came under fire the athens clashes paralleled similar events in other greek cities and throughout europe as anger was focused against greek consulates .
analysts say the severity of the violence was caused by long-simmering discontent with the government over a series of financial scandals and unpopular economic , pension and education reforms .
the shooting of grigoropoulos was seen as the last straw by many young greeks , whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment and low wages . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .

dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?

why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 12.12.2008 mugabe declares cholera outbreak over as pressure increases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe is under increasing international pressure to step down as president of zimbabwe in an apparent bid to end calls for international intervention against his regime , zimbabwean president robert mugabe has claimed that the cholera epidemic that has killed nearly 800 people since august is over . " britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 12.12.2008 opinion : only international community can ensure mugabe 's fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action , not words is what 's needed now in zimbabwe , says schaeffer zimbabwe 's ruler robert mugabe is destroying his country and trampling human rights as the international community looks on .
it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.12.2008 merkel agrees to eu 's multi-billion-euro bailout despite doubts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel has been under increasing pressure to tow the eu line on economic issues german leader angela merkel is giving her backing to a 200-billion-euro plan to dig europe out of recession after her finance minister said tossing money around would only increase the debt burden . as eu leaders gathered in brussels for a summit , germany 's finance minister peer steinbrueck added to simmering tensions over the europe-wide stimulus plan by offering up a withering criticism of britain 's economic policy .
but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck 's comments have caused a minor storm " when i ask about the origins of the crisis , economists i respect tell me it is the credit-financed growth of recent years and decades .
" is n't this the same mistake everyone is suddenly making again , under all the public pressure ? "
steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .
germany has already done this in a first step , " merkel said .
" for us , it 's all about saving jobs in germany . "
germany 's stance irking european partners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown and sarkozy have criticized germany 's caution germany has faced intense pressure from british prime minister gordon brown , french president nicolas sarkozy and european commission chief jose manuel barroso to boost domestic consumption , but has refused to indulge in borrowing and deficit spending .
brown dismissed steinbrueck 's criticism and said the comments were " internal german politics " and merkel said as she arrived in brussels that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
because some governments can not afford to make a very big contribution to the eu stimulus effort , some countries will have to put much more in than the average contribution .
of the stimulus target of 1.5 percent of gdp , 1.2 percent is supposed to consist of various national measures .
almunia said governments have so far committed less than that , with all the national measures adding up to only 0.8-0.9 percent . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de britain , germany trade criticisms in growing financial row angela merkel may have shrugged off the apparent snub of not being invited to monday ’ s mini-summit between britain and france but it is unlikely that new comments from the british government will be dismissed as easily .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .

according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .

" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .

" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .
12 as the two-day summit draws to a close .
the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .
but the chairman of the group of finance ministers from countries that use the single currency said leaders should not get too caught up over the size of individual contributions by different countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : junker , right , with ecb president jean claude trichet " i do n't think it would be wise to overly concentrate and focus on the figure on the envelope , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , chairman of the eurogroup , told reporters .
according to the eu commission , the euro zone as a whole is now in recession and likely to be so throughout 2009 .
but while juncker played down differences over the size of individual contributions , eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said europe 's biggest economy should stump up more than it has offered so far .
" as the eu 's biggest economy with a balanced budget , germany should make the difference with its contribution -lrb- to give -rrb- a boost to the economy of europe , " almunia told german newspaper tagesspiegel .
germany reluctant to increase contributions the german government , which is itself divided over how best to tackle the recession , has so far resisted the idea of contributing more than the 31 billion euros over two years that berlin judges necessary to revive the german economy .
in an interview with newsweek magazine , steinbrueck made clear berlin 's unease about funding stimulus packages .

steinbrueck was particularly scathing about a 20-billion-pound -lrb- 22.5-billion-euro -rrb- stimulus plan recently approved by britain .
" all this will do is raise britain 's debt to a level that will take a whole generation to work off , " he said .
distancing herself from steinbrueck 's comments , merkel hinted that berlin was prepared to make a bigger contribution to the european package .
" germany is aware of its responsibility as a large economy and we are going to consider what we can still do , especially in light of the american -lrb- stimulus -rrb- measures that will come in january with the new president , " she said .
" we believe that every country has to give an important stimulus .

even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .

karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .

12 in new clashes that first broke out over the police killing of a teenager a week ago . students , angry at the shooting incident , low wages and unemployment , attacked police outside the parliament building on a seventh day of violence that has shaken the government .
riot police fired teargas in response .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .
greece 's debt almost equals its economic output .
economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .
police sources say they are running out of teargas after using more than 4,600 capsules in the last week and have urgently contacted israel and germany for more stocks .
" everyone wants this government of murderers to fall .
the government in four years has only carried out reforms against students , " said maria tsoupri , 22 .
" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .
greeks rushing to work on friday were keen for their cities to return to normal after the protests , which the greek commerce confederation said caused 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265.3 million -rrb- of damage to more than 500 shops in athens alone .
several schools and universities remained occupied by students and professors formed a human chain around the main university building to protect it from further damage .
" it will become calm now .
but i want the government to clean up , to get the market and the economy moving , " said isidoros aletas , 21 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .

the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .

" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .

swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the quieting came ahead of the release friday , dec .
12 , of the results of a ballistics examination of the bullet which killed 15-year-old schoolboy alexandros grigoropoulos on saturday .
outrage over the teenager 's death sparked widespread riots across greece and minor flare-ups in other european cities .
the policeman who shot the boy , epaminondas korkoneas , remains in custody in a high-security prison in the athens suburb korydallos after being charged with voluntary homicide , which under greek law does not necessarily involve premeditation .
policeman claims self-defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence and rioting throughout greece has been fierce korkoneas is accused of killing grigoropoulos during a clash with around 30 youths in the exarchia district of athens .
the police officer has claimed self defense .
his lawyers said a ballistics analysis indicated the bullet had ricocheted before hitting the schoolboy .
korkoneas 's partner , vassilios saraliotis , 31 , was charged with being an accomplice and will also remain in custody .
fresh rallies new student rallies were planned for friday and monday .
on thursday , the sixth day of demonstrations , about 4,000 students took to the streets in athens in a protest that turned increasingly violent .
demonstrators clashed with security forces near the country 's biggest prison and a university in central athens .
crowds threw rocks and other missiles at police , who retaliated using tear gas , a prison guard said .
attacks on stores in several other areas and road blockades were also reported .
more than 400 businesses have been hit by the rioting , with 37 completely gutted .
the damage in athens alone was worth about 200 million euros -lrb- $ 259 million -rrb- , according to the greek commerce confederation .
anger at government reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests spread around europe as greek consulates came under fire the athens clashes paralleled similar events in other greek cities and throughout europe as anger was focused against greek consulates .
analysts say the severity of the violence was caused by long-simmering discontent with the government over a series of financial scandals and unpopular economic , pension and education reforms .
the shooting of grigoropoulos was seen as the last straw by many young greeks , whose economic future is bleak in a country with a high unemployment and low wages . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .

at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .

"
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .

"
" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .
if both bayern and hoffenheim slip up , bayer leverkusen - which sits three points adrift - have a chance of going top with a win at home to struggling energie cottbus .

now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .

mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .

stuttgart hurdle for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern coach juergen klinsmann wants to end 2008 on a high klinsmann 's side drew level on 34 points with hoffenheim after defeating the promoted side thanks to a stoppage-time goal from luca toni last friday .
now mid-table stuttgart stand in bayern 's way .
a couple of weeks ago the trip would have engendered little trepidation , but two successive league wins under new coach markus babbel have made the swabians a tougher prospect .
babbel , 36 , now has the opportunity to show his former club why the appointment , initially until the end of the season , should be made a more permanent one .
" when i go on the pitch i want to win .
just because the opponent is bayern munich i am not going out there to be happy with just one point , " he told german news agency dpa .
" that 's something i want to get across to the boys .
you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .
mueller talks down schalke resignation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke manager andreas mueller , right , is confident his job is safe hoffenheim will be tested by seventh-placed schalke , whose 1-0 win last weekend over hertha berlin has provided some respite to dutch coach fred rutten and general manager andreas mueller .
mueller , who has borne the brunt of fan anger at the side 's indifferent season , hit back this week at criticism of his player signings and dismissed any talk of resigning .
" i am a fighter .
i will still be manager of schalke at the end of the season , " he said .
" we had good talks with the supervisory board on monday and we have their full support . "
elsewhere , fourth-placed hertha berlin take on lowly karlsruhe , while fifth-placed sv hamburg - level on 30 points with hertha - entertain eintracht frankfurt .
olic transfer rumours bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could be bayern bound hamburg are in a fight to keep striker ivica olic who is being courted by several clubs including bayern munich .
the 29-year-old croatian could leave on a free transfer at the end of the season , and bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said late wednesday : " our cards are n't so bad .
he is a forward who would fit in well with us . "

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .
the aacc also echoed a recent call by south african archbishop emeritus desmond tutu for mugabe to be pressured into relinquishing his stranglehold on power . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but chancellor merkel tried to strike a more conciliatory tone than her famously sharp-tongued finance minister , saying that " we support the european commission 's initiative . "
with the specter of recession looming large , the commission wants heads of state and government to sign up to its proposed plans at the summit to pump 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 260 billion -rrb- into the european economy , according to a draft of the text obtained by reuters news agency . leaders are expected to pass the stimulus package on friday , dec .

the plan , based on a series of national and eu measures worth 1.5 percent of the 27-nation european union 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , would ramp up public investment across europe and allow for some taxes to be eased .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .

" it is extremely important we round off the year with success , " said klinsmann .
there is no trophy at stake , but finishing top at the halfway stage of the season is a coveted unofficial prize .
in 45 bundesliga seasons so far , 31 of the teams who led at the winter break have gone on to take the league title .
a third team is also in the running .

you have to go out there with this attitude and with this self-confidence .
" the boys are good , they have a lot of quality and they have to show what they can do in the team .
we have to make sure we work as a team and not be overawed by big names . "
for klinsmann , who played with babbel for two seasons at bayern , stuttgart will be something of a homecoming .
the former striker hails from near the city and began his playing career at stuttgarter kickers before joining vfb stuttgart for five seasons in the 1980s .

12 in new clashes that first broke out over the police killing of a teenager a week ago . students , angry at the shooting incident , low wages and unemployment , attacked police outside the parliament building on a seventh day of violence that has shaken the government .
riot police fired teargas in response .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .
greece 's debt almost equals its economic output .
economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .

it 's an impossibility and a sign of helplessness , says deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer . has the end finally come for the despot mugabe ?
comments from the international community leave the question unanswered .
" it is appropriate for robert mugabe to leave , " says the american secretary of state condoleezza rice .
but then she adds , " it is time that the international community forces mugabe from office . "
europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .
this all sounds good , even when reaching such clarity has taking a long time .
but what will this bring for the people of zimbabwe ?
who will throw the senile , self-obsessed dictator mugabe from the throne to which he is clutching for dear life ?
time running out for zimbabwe enough with all of these trite political messages !
the decision-makers in brussels and washington should be called .
the people of zimbabwe do n't have any more time to lose .
take a close look : mugabe is letting his own people starve and his country rot .
he is crushing his opponents and zimbabwe 's potential .
do people really need to be reminded of what is in the international declaration of human rights , which just celebrated another anniversary ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ute schaeffer they are undeniable , basic human rights that are being violated every day in zimbabwe : the right to freedom of thought and expression , the right to express political will and vote , the right to social security , the right to life and physical integrity and the right to education .
dear states and democrats who have established the regard and assurance of human rights in foreign policy and multi-lateral domestic policies for yourselves : do something other than issue trite political messages .
take action .
it 's not enough to tighten the sanctions against representative of the mugabe regime -lrb- like the europeans do -rrb- , it 's not enough to send expert commissions who should solve the water crisis -lrb- like the south africans do -rrb- .
and it wo n't be enough to send humanitarian aid for millions of zimbabweans .
happy birthday for human rights ?
it is n't about the supply crisis in zimbabwe .
it 's about the massive disregard for fundamental human rights and the international community is losing its credibility as it does nothing - – right at the anniversary of the general declaration of human rights , coincidentally enough .
what would happen if the situation in zimbabwe were to happen in ukraine or in the balkans ?
would the international community step in ?
in my opinion , yes it would !
but different rules apply for africa .
europeans and americans are happy to take responsibility for africans .
or at least in theory .
so it is high time for a crisis summit with the us-europe-african union .
why not put the talked-about relationship between europe and africa to the test ?
why ca n't these three parties see themselves as advocates of human rights and decide upon a united course of action for the people of zimbabwe and against the dictator mugabe .
why is it so difficult to talk to africa , which can see how its own democratic ideals and therewith the ideal of a new , reformed africa are being betrayed everyday by its neighbors .
the key to mugabe 's fall lies in supporting south africa and its neighbors by necessity .
the international community should n't get deeply involved in make joint efforts , but rather request bilateral talks for each country with the government in pretoria .
the question of why our policy in the case of zimbabwe appears to be so anemic , shameful and weak is as easy as it is disgraceful : the catastrophe is too far away and other standards apply for africa – even in our foreign policy .
when it comes to human rights , it seems that out of sight is out of mind .

europeans also see it this way – all 27 countries are united in the opinion that that mugabe should retire , said eu external commissioner javier solana after talks with the rice at the beginning of the week in brussels .

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .

" britain wants military intervention because of cholera , " the 84-year-old autocrat told a gathering of party supporters at the funeral of a senior member of his zanu-pf party .
" our doctors are being assisted by the who -lrb- world health organization -rrb- to bring it under control .
" now there is no cholera , there is no cause for war . "
mugabe was reacting to a slew of calls from western and a couple of african leaders in recent days for him to step down over his country 's economic and humanitarian crises .
water supply , sanitation and state health and education services have ground to a halt as zimbabwe 's economy caves in under eight years of hyperinflation .
british prime minister gordon brown last weekend called for international action to remove mugabe .
the united states , france , germany and the european union have also called for the leader of 28 years to bow out .
mugabe 's remarks on cholera , which were carried on national television , surprised health experts given that , only a week ago , the government declared the epidemic a " national disaster . "
the world health organization contradicted mugabe 's assessment of the situation , saying the death toll in the outbreak had risen to 788 and the number of suspected cases to 16,403 .
the outbreak has spilled over into neighboring countries .
south africa has declared the vhembe region around musina on the border with zimbabwe a disaster area .
at least eight people , six zimbabweans and two south africans , have died of cholera in musina so far and close to 700 been infected .
the area is crammed with zimbabwean cross-border traders and illegal immigrants trying to escape their country .
at least four people have also died in mozambique along that country 's border with zimbabwe .
zimbabwe 's state-controlled herald newspaper said thursday that zambia and tanzania were also affected .
but mugabe told mourners at a funeral that cholera " came from other countries . "
mugabe 's supporters blame others for cholera outbreak one of the placards displayed at the funeral said , " brown 's cholera . "
a government minister earlier this week accused the west of " contaminating " zimbabwe with cholera .
bildunterschrift : a zimbabwean minister accused the west of contaminating the country with cholera mugabe also denounced morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- with whom he signed a power-sharing agreement in september , for travelling around the world , " looking for support . "
" we do n't want that kind of prostitution , " he said .
meanwhile , the british government minister responsible for africa , mark malloch brown , held talks with south africa 's foreign minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma thursday about the situation in zimbabwe , which water and health ministers from the region are due to discuss friday .
the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- regional political grouping , of which south africa has currently the chair , is trying to push zanu-pf and the mdc into a unity deal but the parties disagree on how positions of power should be allocated .
religious leaders in southern africa have expressed frustration at zimbabweans ' worsening plight .
the all african conference of churches , which represents 120 million christians in africa , in a statement urged all churches on the continent and around the world to engage in a special africa day of prayer and fasting for justice in zimbabwe on january 25 .

12 in new clashes that first broke out over the police killing of a teenager a week ago . students , angry at the shooting incident , low wages and unemployment , attacked police outside the parliament building on a seventh day of violence that has shaken the government .
riot police fired teargas in response .
greek prime minister costas karamanlis pledged to guarantee the safety of its people and citizens .
" greece is a safe country , " he told a news conference in brussels riots since the dec .
6 shooting of 15-year-old alexandros grigoropoulos have destroyed hundreds of shops , banks and cars , rattled the conservative government and shaken investor confidence in the 240 billion euro economy -lrb- $ 315 billion -rrb- as the global crisis bites .
even as karamanlis spoke in brussels , about 5,000 protesters marched through athens carrying banners saying : " the state kills " and " the government is guilty of murder " .
in bond markets , the spread between greek debt and german benchmark bonds - a measure of perceived risk - reached its widest point this decade on friday , at over 2 percentage points .
" we do not expect investors to forget this situation quickly , " said david keeble , head of fixed income research at calyon bank .
greece 's debt almost equals its economic output .
economic pressure adds to government 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karamanlis feels the heat of greece 's economic situation karamanlis said greece was weathering the credit crunch better than other eu members and sent a message to markets that , despite the crisis , the economy was solid .
" greece is covering and will -lrb- continue -rrb- to cover its borrowing needs smoothly , " he said .
the killing of grigoropoulos ignited simmering anger over a series of scandals , unpopular reforms and misfired economic measures as the credit crunch reached greece .
police sources say they are running out of teargas after using more than 4,600 capsules in the last week and have urgently contacted israel and germany for more stocks .
" everyone wants this government of murderers to fall .
the government in four years has only carried out reforms against students , " said maria tsoupri , 22 .
" we do n't see a future .
we have a future only through struggle . "
karamanlis , whose new democracy party has a one-seat majority and has seen its popularity ratings dive in recent months , expressed sorrow at the shooting but said the violence that followed was the work of extremists .
media criticized the government 's slow response to the crisis .
" the bell tolls for karamanlis , " ta nea newspaper said on its front page , while ethnos said " government under siege ; education protests escalate . "
rain subsides and rioters again take to the streets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anger at the shooting and social conditions is fuelling the riots heavy rain helped curtail demonstrations compared to previous days .
the protests inspired small protests in some european cities , sowing fears of copy-cat riots elsewhere .
police said 432 people , including many foreign immigrants , have been detained , with 176 of them charged with violence and looting .
many greeks are angry that the policeman charged with murdering the teenager has not expressed remorse .
epaminondas korkoneas , 37 , testified that he fired warning shots in self-defense which ricocheted .
he and his police partner , charged as an accomplice , are being held in jail pending trial , which could take months .
greeks rushing to work on friday were keen for their cities to return to normal after the protests , which the greek commerce confederation said caused 200 million euros -lrb- $ 265.3 million -rrb- of damage to more than 500 shops in athens alone .

the country officially joined the schengen agreement on friday , dec .
12 , opening its borders to much of europe . for the 700,000 commuters who cross the borders between european union countries and switzerland every day , life got just a little bit easier on friday .
as clocks struck midnight , switzerland officially joined the schengen agreement , meaning passports will no longer be checked at the border crossings between the confederation and the rest of europe .
" schengen means " there will be " no systematic control of the borders anymore , " michaela rickenbacker , the chief of the swiss border police , told local radio .
however , she admitted , most systematic checks have already been removed .
people will feel the difference , but only slightly .
border checks will remain in place for custom issues .
for non-eu residents , the big difference will be that a schengen visa will get them into switzerland , and a swiss visa will grant them access to the rest of europe .
passengers on flights between swiss airports and other schengen-zone destinations , however , will continue to have to show their passports until march 29 , to allow for airports to implement necessary changes .
swiss interested in security cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving into switzerland will get a little easier swiss officials said they joined the agreement largely to gain access to schengen security information , granting them better knowledge about terrorism , criminal threats and asylum seekers .
the system also allows them to share their intelligence with other members .
" previously , switzerland was considered as an island " by the criminals , hans arzethauser , a spokesman for the swiss border security force , told afp news agency . " this new system gives us one more security tool and helps us to identify wanted people , stolen vehicles and asylum seekers , " he said . ironically , switzerland will now have to put up a border crossing where it has not had one for decades , on the border with the tiny principality of liechtenstein .
as the principality has no airport - except for a small heliport - and is landlocked between austria and switzerland , most people have no way in or out of the country without going through a schengen country .
schengen set to get bigger liechtenstein is tentatively set to join the agreement next year .
the schengen passport-free zone was originally created by france , germany , belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg in 1985 near the luxembourg town of schengen .
it was put into practice in 1990 and expanded to cover the larger eu in 1995 , except for the islands of britain and ireland , which remained outside the pact .
non-eu members norway and iceland also joined the zone in 2001 , and in 2007 , nine new eu member states , mostly in central and eastern europe , joined as well . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 150 gang members agreed to attend the sessions on " neutral ground " at the city 's sheriff court in october .
they were confronted with the effects of gang violence and offered help to turn their lives around .
more sessions have been planned in the hope of offering help to some 780 members of 55 gangs in glasgow .
the £ 5m community initiative to reduce violence is led by scotland 's violence reduction unit -lrb- vru -rrb- .
it is based on the so-called " boston miracle " , which reduced violent crime in the us city by about 50 % in two years during the 1990s .
the boston ceasefire project saw gang members invited to meetings with police and church leaders where they were told things had to change .
gang culture is deeply ingrained in parts of the city can boston offer glasgow a miracle ?
those who embraced the chance were offered jobs , counselling and other forms of support .
gang members who ignored the message were threatened with longer , harsher sentences in federal prisons .
scotland 's vru decided to use a similar approach earlier this year in glasgow .
working with strathclyde police , they invited 220 people along to glasgow sherriff court on 24 october for a gang summit .
at least five people were invited from each of the 55 gangs targeted in the city .
two sessions were held - one in the morning for those aged 15 and under , and one in the afternoon for those aged 16 and over .
about 150 gang members agreed to attend and were brought to the court by minibus with police officers on board to stop any violence .
pursuit warning during a carefully scripted meeting the gang members heard from a senior police officer , an accident and emergency consultant , members of their community and the parent of a victim .
they were also shown an interactive map which identified glasgow gangs , their members and the territory in which they operated .
the senior police officer then told the gang members that if any of them - including members not present - committed an assault or murder , they would be pursued as a whole group .
the vru said this often had the effect of pushing gangs to police their own behaviour . "
the law needs to be enforced but it 's also time to try something new " kenny macaskill justice secretary at the end of each session , gang members were given the freephone number of a " one-stop shop " where they could access education , health services , careers advice and social services .
to date some 63 of the 150 gang members who attended the october sessions have taken up the offer of help , with more coming forward every day .
the vru are planning to hold at least four more sessions until every member of the 55 city gangs targeted has attended .
det ch sup john carnochan , head of vru , said : " gangs are not necessarily a bad thing - gangs are formed by people coming together with a common purpose , so strathclyde police is a gang , journalists are a gang , politicians are a gang .
" it 's what the gang does when it comes together that is the issue .
if they were meeting to play football , or basketball , or baseball , no-one would mind .
" but the reason they meet is violence , and that can not and will not be tolerated . "
justice secretary kenny macaskill said : " for too long now areas of glasgow have been blighted by gangs and gang violence .
" but enough is enough .
it can not go on .
the law needs to be enforced but it 's also time to try something new , something bold , and sort the problem at source .
" i believe this initiative can make a difference and that is why the scottish government has invested £ 1.6m to make the project a reality . "

advertisement us probation officer chris gillis carries out a night visit more than 100 glasgow gang members have taken part in talks with police as part of a us-inspired scheme to curb violence , it has emerged .
about 150 gang members agreed to attend the sessions on " neutral ground " at the city 's sheriff court in october .
they were confronted with the effects of gang violence and offered help to turn their lives around .
more sessions have been planned in the hope of offering help to some 780 members of 55 gangs in glasgow .
the £ 5m community initiative to reduce violence is led by scotland 's violence reduction unit -lrb- vru -rrb- .
it is based on the so-called " boston miracle " , which reduced violent crime in the us city by about 50 % in two years during the 1990s .
the boston ceasefire project saw gang members invited to meetings with police and church leaders where they were told things had to change .
gang culture is deeply ingrained in parts of the city can boston offer glasgow a miracle ?
those who embraced the chance were offered jobs , counselling and other forms of support .
gang members who ignored the message were threatened with longer , harsher sentences in federal prisons .
scotland 's vru decided to use a similar approach earlier this year in glasgow .
working with strathclyde police , they invited 220 people along to glasgow sherriff court on 24 october for a gang summit .
at least five people were invited from each of the 55 gangs targeted in the city .
two sessions were held - one in the morning for those aged 15 and under , and one in the afternoon for those aged 16 and over .
about 150 gang members agreed to attend and were brought to the court by minibus with police officers on board to stop any violence .
pursuit warning during a carefully scripted meeting the gang members heard from a senior police officer , an accident and emergency consultant , members of their community and the parent of a victim .
they were also shown an interactive map which identified glasgow gangs , their members and the territory in which they operated .
the senior police officer then told the gang members that if any of them - including members not present - committed an assault or murder , they would be pursued as a whole group .
the vru said this often had the effect of pushing gangs to police their own behaviour .
the law needs to be enforced but it 's also time to try something new kenny macaskill justice secretary at the end of each session , gang members were given the freephone number of a " one-stop shop " where they could access education , health services , careers advice and social services .
to date some 63 of the 150 gang members who attended the october sessions have taken up the offer of help , with more coming forward every day .
the vru are planning to hold at least four more sessions until every member of the 55 city gangs targeted has attended .
det ch sup john carnochan , head of vru , said : " gangs are not necessarily a bad thing - gangs are formed by people coming together with a common purpose , so strathclyde police is a gang , journalists are a gang , politicians are a gang .
" it 's what the gang does when it comes together that is the issue .
if they were meeting to play football , or basketball , or baseball , no-one would mind .
" but the reason they meet is violence , and that can not and will not be tolerated . "
justice secretary kenny macaskill said : " for too long now areas of glasgow have been blighted by gangs and gang violence .
" but enough is enough .
it can not go on .
the law needs to be enforced but it 's also time to try something new , something bold , and sort the problem at source .

this is despite assembly government plans to develop two centres at hospitals in cardiff and swansea .
writing to the deputy chief medical officer , professor mike harmer , the surgeons say a single site would provide a " safe and effective service " .
prof harmer said the consultants ' views would be considered .
in september , health minister edwina hart announced a " clinical network " would allow services to stay at the university hospital of wales , cardiff and morriston hospital , swansea .
it meant specialist staff would work at the two sites , keeping them both open .
this followed a review led by professor james steers , a consultant neurosurgeon from edinburgh .
" we welcome the view from the neurosurgeons , " said prof harmer .
" this will be considered as part of the ongoing implementation of the steers report recommendations . "
a sustainable future can only be achieved with a single neurosurgery unit richard hatfield , consultant neurosurgeon dr alan axford of hywel dda nhs trust is to lead a group looking at how to implement that decision in the new year .
patients in north wales will continue to receive treatment at walton hospital , liverpool .
but richard hatfield , a consultant neurosurgeon at the university hospital of wales , cardiff , said sustaining two units was " not viable " .
he warned that non-emergency treatments may have to be cut back before the end of the year if the situation remained the same .
" the way things are going at the moment even by after christmas we 'll be having difficulty providing a full service , " he told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme .
" the difficulties are really taken in the form of having enough junior staff to provide 24 hour services and something will have to give .
" a sustainable future can only be achieved with a single neurosurgery unit . "
professor ann rosser from cardiff university 's school of biosciences said she feared political interference was jeopardising the work of research teams there .
" from the point of view of developing really high quality international research there 's a critical mass that 's required and we really need a centre of excellence here in cardiff , " she said .
' unsustainable ' in 2006 , a review by health commission wales recommended complex surgery should only be carried out in cardiff and warned that keeping two sites open would be unsustainable .
but plans to close the neurosurgery unit at morriston hospital were put on hold after a high profile campaign .
conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said ms hart should " start listening to the experts " .
" this idea that we can continue in the medium and long term by having two sites is a nonsense and i think the minister has to accept that only one site is viable in the long term , " he said .
liberal democrat peter black said there was a danger services in both cities would " wither on the vine " if the concerns of consultants were not addressed .
' travelling distance ' " i have argued from the beginning that there needs to be a single neurosurgical service and that swansea is the logical place to site it , " he said .
" it has good communications links , is geographically central and together with the bristol service will ensure that the whole of south wales is within easy travelling distance of a service . "
abertawe bro morgannwg university nhs trust said it fully supported the recommendations of prof steers ' report .
" we will be working with dr alan axford to implement the recommendations of the report , and with cardiff and vale nhs trust to develop the services for all patients , right across south wales , " it said .
" while mr axford 's work with the implementation group is ongoing it would be inappropriate for the trust to comment any further . "
responding to mr morgan 's and mr black 's comments , a spokesperson for ms hart said : " the minister has invested a lot of time and effort in these issues to ensure that there is a good service provided to all the people of wales .
" unfortunately , she finds it all too predictable that opposition members would seek to make mischief in this way . "

at the age of 12 , alan , -lrb- not his real name -rrb- had drunk himself unconscious and was being revived by paramedics after attending a friend 's birthday party .
he had drunk a bottle of vodka , along with half a bottle of martini .
but he had already been consuming huge amounts of alcohol for a year before that watershed incident brought his problem to the attention of his shocked parents .
" i work full-time and i would send him to a child minders , " said the distraught mother from bournemouth .
" unbeknown to me , alan had stopped going after school and had started hanging around with much older children - the wrong crowd basically . "
further signs that all was not well with him began surfacing in primary school and continued into his secondary schooling , where he was constantly " getting into trouble " .
i think a lot of it was probably my fault , i did not keep a closer eye on him jane children , alcohol and the law doubts over drink laws however , his parents bore the full brunt of the side effects symptomatic of excessive drinking .

over the years , alan has also destroyed most of the family furniture .
neither he nor jane have been able cope with his drinking , which spiralled out of control - both have been prescribed anti-depressants .
alan was eventually diagnosed as an alcoholic at 15 , by which time he was consuming about 10 to 15 cans of lager a day .

anti-social behaviour research shows alan 's story is not only far from unique but one that is familiar to a growing number of families across britain .
portsmouth is one city which has obtained government funding to combat under-age drinking .
the paulsgrove area has the highest percentage of 11-16 year olds in the city , and is currently the area with the highest rate of under-age drinkers according to hampshire police .

in particular , cheltenham road and allaway avenue featured on the force 's top 10 worst streets for anti-social behaviour offences and collectively accounted for more than 20 % of this type of offence in the city , a police spokeswoman said .
insp eddie charlton , of hampshire police , said : " the alcohol tends to give them a bit more bravado and makes them do more stupid things - criminal damage , being abusive to residents and generally making their neighbours and their community 's lives much more miserable . "
last year , alcohol concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted in its report on the government 's alcohol harm reduction strategy .
the study 's figures showed on average boys aged 11 to 13 were drinking 50 % more alcohol in 2006 than in 2000 .
the alcohol consumption figure for girls almost doubled in the same period .
dr nick sheron , a liver specialist at southampton university hospitals trust , believes the " easy accessibility of cheap alcohol " is one of the major factors fuelling under-age drinking .
" the government should increase tax on alcohol in line with income gradually in order to redress the balance , " he said .
" there has been a tenfold increase in liver deaths since the 1970s .

at the age of 12 , alan , -lrb- not his real name -rrb- had drunk himself unconscious and was being revived by paramedics after attending a friend 's birthday party .
he had drunk a bottle of vodka , along with half a bottle of martini .
but he had already been consuming huge amounts of alcohol for a year before that watershed incident brought his problem to the attention of his shocked parents .
" i work full-time and i would send him to a child minders , " said the distraught mother from bournemouth .
" unbeknown to me , alan had stopped going after school and had started hanging around with much older children - the wrong crowd basically . "
further signs that all was not well with him began surfacing in primary school and continued into his secondary schooling , where he was constantly " getting into trouble " .
i think a lot of it was probably my fault , i did not keep a closer eye on him jane children , alcohol and the law doubts over drink laws however , his parents bore the full brunt of the side effects symptomatic of excessive drinking .
" he has quite violent rages when he is drunk , " added jane .
" he would head-butt the wall or punch the door - every single door in our house had to be replaced . "
over the years , alan has also destroyed most of the family furniture .
neither he nor jane have been able cope with his drinking , which spiralled out of control - both have been prescribed anti-depressants .
alan was eventually diagnosed as an alcoholic at 15 , by which time he was consuming about 10 to 15 cans of lager a day .
it was then doctors warned him if he continued along this destructive path he would be dead at 25 .
however , alan , now 20 , did try two years ago to start afresh by completing an apprenticeship to become a painter and decorator .
but he crashed his car while drunk and lost his job as a result .
he is now on police bail awaiting trial for alcohol-related violence , according to jane .
" i think a lot of it was probably my fault , i did not keep a closer eye on him , " she said .
anti-social behaviour research shows alan 's story is not only far from unique but one that is familiar to a growing number of families across britain .
portsmouth is one city which has obtained government funding to combat under-age drinking .
the paulsgrove area has the highest percentage of 11-16 year olds in the city , and is currently the area with the highest rate of under-age drinkers according to hampshire police .
a new " weekend project " , funded with £ 24,000 from the home office , is aimed at educating young people and their parents about the dangers of under-age drinking and offering support .
figures showed children aged 11 to 13 are drinking more alcohol police figures showed 659 alcohol-related anti-social behaviour offences were recorded in paulsgrove from 1 march to 31 august this year .
in particular , cheltenham road and allaway avenue featured on the force 's top 10 worst streets for anti-social behaviour offences and collectively accounted for more than 20 % of this type of offence in the city , a police spokeswoman said .
insp eddie charlton , of hampshire police , said : " the alcohol tends to give them a bit more bravado and makes them do more stupid things - criminal damage , being abusive to residents and generally making their neighbours and their community 's lives much more miserable . "
last year , alcohol concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted in its report on the government 's alcohol harm reduction strategy .
the study 's figures showed on average boys aged 11 to 13 were drinking 50 % more alcohol in 2006 than in 2000 .
the alcohol consumption figure for girls almost doubled in the same period .
dr nick sheron , a liver specialist at southampton university hospitals trust , believes the " easy accessibility of cheap alcohol " is one of the major factors fuelling under-age drinking .
" the government should increase tax on alcohol in line with income gradually in order to redress the balance , " he said .
" there has been a tenfold increase in liver deaths since the 1970s .
" i think we have got the balance wrong and it 's the young people who are paying the price for that . "

at the age of 12 , alan , -lrb- not his real name -rrb- had drunk himself unconscious and was being revived by paramedics after attending a friend 's birthday party .
he had drunk a bottle of vodka , along with half a bottle of martini .
but he had already been consuming huge amounts of alcohol for a year before that watershed incident brought his problem to the attention of his shocked parents .

over the years , alan has also destroyed most of the family furniture .
neither he nor jane have been able cope with his drinking , which spiralled out of control - both have been prescribed anti-depressants .
alan was eventually diagnosed as an alcoholic at 15 , by which time he was consuming about 10 to 15 cans of lager a day .
it was then doctors warned him if he continued along this destructive path he would be dead at 25 .
however , alan , now 20 , did try two years ago to start afresh by completing an apprenticeship to become a painter and decorator .
but he crashed his car while drunk and lost his job as a result .
he is now on police bail awaiting trial for alcohol-related violence , according to jane .
" i think a lot of it was probably my fault , i did not keep a closer eye on him , " she said .
anti-social behaviour research shows alan 's story is not only far from unique but one that is familiar to a growing number of families across britain .
portsmouth is one city which has obtained government funding to combat under-age drinking .
the paulsgrove area has the highest percentage of 11-16 year olds in the city , and is currently the area with the highest rate of under-age drinkers according to hampshire police .
a new " weekend project " , funded with £ 24,000 from the home office , is aimed at educating young people and their parents about the dangers of under-age drinking and offering support .
figures showed children aged 11 to 13 are drinking more alcohol police figures showed 659 alcohol-related anti-social behaviour offences were recorded in paulsgrove from 1 march to 31 august this year .
in particular , cheltenham road and allaway avenue featured on the force 's top 10 worst streets for anti-social behaviour offences and collectively accounted for more than 20 % of this type of offence in the city , a police spokeswoman said .
insp eddie charlton , of hampshire police , said : " the alcohol tends to give them a bit more bravado and makes them do more stupid things - criminal damage , being abusive to residents and generally making their neighbours and their community 's lives much more miserable . "
last year , alcohol concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted in its report on the government 's alcohol harm reduction strategy .
the study 's figures showed on average boys aged 11 to 13 were drinking 50 % more alcohol in 2006 than in 2000 .
the alcohol consumption figure for girls almost doubled in the same period .
dr nick sheron , a liver specialist at southampton university hospitals trust , believes the " easy accessibility of cheap alcohol " is one of the major factors fuelling under-age drinking .
" the government should increase tax on alcohol in line with income gradually in order to redress the balance , " he said .
" there has been a tenfold increase in liver deaths since the 1970s .
" i think we have got the balance wrong and it 's the young people who are paying the price for that . "

at the age of 12 , alan , -lrb- not his real name -rrb- had drunk himself unconscious and was being revived by paramedics after attending a friend 's birthday party .
he had drunk a bottle of vodka , along with half a bottle of martini .
but he had already been consuming huge amounts of alcohol for a year before that watershed incident brought his problem to the attention of his shocked parents .
" i work full-time and i would send him to a child minders , " said the distraught mother from bournemouth .
" unbeknown to me , alan had stopped going after school and had started hanging around with much older children - the wrong crowd basically . "
further signs that all was not well with him began surfacing in primary school and continued into his secondary schooling , where he was constantly " getting into trouble " .
i think a lot of it was probably my fault , i did not keep a closer eye on him jane children , alcohol and the law doubts over drink laws however , his parents bore the full brunt of the side effects symptomatic of excessive drinking .
" he has quite violent rages when he is drunk , " added jane .
" he would head-butt the wall or punch the door - every single door in our house had to be replaced . "
over the years , alan has also destroyed most of the family furniture .
neither he nor jane have been able cope with his drinking , which spiralled out of control - both have been prescribed anti-depressants .
alan was eventually diagnosed as an alcoholic at 15 , by which time he was consuming about 10 to 15 cans of lager a day .
it was then doctors warned him if he continued along this destructive path he would be dead at 25 .
however , alan , now 20 , did try two years ago to start afresh by completing an apprenticeship to become a painter and decorator .
but he crashed his car while drunk and lost his job as a result .
he is now on police bail awaiting trial for alcohol-related violence , according to jane .
" i think a lot of it was probably my fault , i did not keep a closer eye on him , " she said .
anti-social behaviour research shows alan 's story is not only far from unique but one that is familiar to a growing number of families across britain .
portsmouth is one city which has obtained government funding to combat under-age drinking .
the paulsgrove area has the highest percentage of 11-16 year olds in the city , and is currently the area with the highest rate of under-age drinkers according to hampshire police .
a new " weekend project " , funded with £ 24,000 from the home office , is aimed at educating young people and their parents about the dangers of under-age drinking and offering support .
figures showed children aged 11 to 13 are drinking more alcohol police figures showed 659 alcohol-related anti-social behaviour offences were recorded in paulsgrove from 1 march to 31 august this year .
in particular , cheltenham road and allaway avenue featured on the force 's top 10 worst streets for anti-social behaviour offences and collectively accounted for more than 20 % of this type of offence in the city , a police spokeswoman said .
insp eddie charlton , of hampshire police , said : " the alcohol tends to give them a bit more bravado and makes them do more stupid things - criminal damage , being abusive to residents and generally making their neighbours and their community 's lives much more miserable . "
last year , alcohol concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted in its report on the government 's alcohol harm reduction strategy .
the study 's figures showed on average boys aged 11 to 13 were drinking 50 % more alcohol in 2006 than in 2000 .
the alcohol consumption figure for girls almost doubled in the same period .
dr nick sheron , a liver specialist at southampton university hospitals trust , believes the " easy accessibility of cheap alcohol " is one of the major factors fuelling under-age drinking .
" the government should increase tax on alcohol in line with income gradually in order to redress the balance , " he said .
" there has been a tenfold increase in liver deaths since the 1970s .
" i think we have got the balance wrong and it 's the young people who are paying the price for that . "
