they 'll be joined this year by delegates from australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa .
climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .
it 's an ambitious undertaking for a three-day summit and already there are signs that the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- may not be able to accomplish much .
profound disagreements between several of the nations combined with the political weakness of some participants means that few expect the g8 meetings to go beyond a series of well-intentioned statements on some of the world 's most pressing topics .
climate change remains on the agenda ahead of the conference , diplomats around the world have been debating a replacement for the kyoto protocol on climate change , which expires in 2012 .
but japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said on june 17 that no agreement on medium-term goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached at the g8 .
efforts to get member countries to agree on a next step have long been hindered by a clash between the world 's biggest polluters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect another kyoto protocol , some analysts warn four members - european union heavyweights germany , britain , france and italy - have already pledged to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent of 1990 levels no matter what the world does , and 30 percent if other major powers do the same .
but the united states , which has refused to ratify kyoto out of fears that it could harm its economy , says a new deal would be ineffective if rapidly developing countries - and potential rivals such as india and china - were not held to the same standards .

those developing economies hit back , arguing that it is unfair to ask them to make expensive changes to their industrial models if the west is not going to do the same .
and those western countries which have signed on are struggling to fulfill the terms of the pact .
the most recent figures from the eu 's emissions-monitoring scheme , released on april 2 , showed that in 2007 the industrial plants and power stations of germany and britain not only failed to cut emissions : they boosted them , by 1.88 and 2.16 percent respectively .
france and italy , the other eu members of the g8 , only managed negligible cuts - 0.27 percent and 0.47 percent respectively .
that failure by germany and britain - two of the most vocal advocates for international deals to cut emissions - could well end up as their achilles heel in climate talks .
it also leaves russia holding the cards , as analysts are unsure how new president dmitry medvedev will react .
moscow 's belated support tipped the balance to bring the kyoto protocol into effect in 2005 .
others warn , however , that the resurgent state could say its reviving industrial base should not be hampered by western-imposed emissions caps .
a weakened world economy should be top priority though environmentalists might like to see climate change at the top of the agenda at this year 's meeting as it was at last year 's , the japanese summit is set against the backdrop of growing fears worldwide about rising interest rates and resurgent inflation .

in parts of central europe , inflation tops 17 percent . meanwhile , hundreds of millions of poor people around the world face a bleak prospect as the most basic commodities become more and more expensive .
such an uncertain economic environment is hardly conducive to the world 's leading trade powers reaching a conclusion in the so-called doha round on agricultural subsidies .
g8 finance ministers expressed concern at the growth of consumer prices , but disagreed over its root causes .
italy 's giulio tremonti was among those pointing a finger at speculators , while us treasury secretary henry paulson said the influence of speculation was negligible .

climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .
it 's an ambitious undertaking for a three-day summit and already there are signs that the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- may not be able to accomplish much .

but the united states , which has refused to ratify kyoto out of fears that it could harm its economy , says a new deal would be ineffective if rapidly developing countries - and potential rivals such as india and china - were not held to the same standards .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are struggling to cope with higher food prices at a pre-summit meeting on june 14 , g8 finance ministers warned that the international economy faces headwinds amid concerns that contracting growth and rising inflation means that the specter of 1970 's-style stagflation could be on the horizon .
" a benign outcome does not look very likely , " kenneth wattret , bnp paribas ' chief eurozone economist told the dpa news agency .
annual inflation in the eu 's 15-member eurozone surged to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent in may , largely due to rising food and oil prices .
to ward off these inflationary pressures triggered by spiraling oil and food prices , the european central bank is expected to hike interest rates in the days leading up to the summit .
bleak prospects while inflation in china eased to a still high 7.7 percent in may , prices in india jumped to a 13-year high of 11.05 percent for the week ending june 7 .
in parts of central europe , inflation tops 17 percent . meanwhile , hundreds of millions of poor people around the world face a bleak prospect as the most basic commodities become more and more expensive .
such an uncertain economic environment is hardly conducive to the world 's leading trade powers reaching a conclusion in the so-called doha round on agricultural subsidies .

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .
lingering anger over eu treaty comments gusenbauer and faymann enraged their junior coalition partner when they announced their intention to hold popular votes on future eu treaties in a letter to austria 's biggest newspaper in late june without informing the conservatives .
molterer said that the social democrats had left the common ground of the coalition agreement and called for a " european perspective for our country . "
the green party and the right-wing freedom party have announced they would support the conservatives in a parliamentary decision on early elections , thus guaranteeing a majority .

he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "
france , italy reconsidering aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent months the world bank has estimated that about $ 10 billion in emergency aid is needed to help poor countries deal with a global food and fuel price increase .
as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .

" the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "

as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole .

" germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .

the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .
warsaw wants defense system polish prime minister donald tusk 's government has been lobbying washington to provide a thaad , or patriot-type air defense system in exchange for hosting the silos .
tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .

the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .

the pilots want better pay , and the passengers are feeling the crunch . german pilots on a 24 hour strike have forced the cancellation of more than 600 cityline and eurowings flights on monday .
thousands of passengers were given the option of finding other flights or using the german rail system .
lufthansa , which owns the two airlines , is not releasing the exact number of passengers affected , though the biggest impact was at the major german airports in frankfurt , munich and düsseldorf . the pilots ' union cockpit called some 1,000 pilots at cityline and eurowings out on a 24-hour strike that was to end at midnight monday .
the union maintains that the companies have not presented an offer worthy of negotiations in the current round of pay talks . the head of tariff policies at cockpit , ilona ritter , told ap that the pilots ’ union was waiting for “ the airlines to move on their demands and come up with an offer . ” lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said that an offer has been on the table for the past four weeks . more strikes in the works lufthansa was also holding negotiations with the labor union ver.di concerning some 60,000 ground and cabin crew members .
however , these talks fell apart last week with no resolution to the problem .
ver.di has given lufthansa a deadline of wednesday to come up with an offer .
in the event that an agreement can ’ t be made by then , the labor union will vote on whether or not they should strike . call before you fly lufthansa is expressing regret over the strike , urging passengers to call before heading to the airport and , if possible , to drive or take the train .
lufthansa spokeswoman renate hocke says the airline finds it “ very unfortunate that passengers are bearing the brunt of this . ” cityline is a subsidiary of lufthansa , which also holds a 49 percent stake eurowings .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong .

" serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong .

but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "
france , italy reconsidering aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent months the world bank has estimated that about $ 10 billion in emergency aid is needed to help poor countries deal with a global food and fuel price increase .
as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "
france , italy reconsidering aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent months the world bank has estimated that about $ 10 billion in emergency aid is needed to help poor countries deal with a global food and fuel price increase .
as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .

they 'll be joined this year by delegates from australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa .
climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .
it 's an ambitious undertaking for a three-day summit and already there are signs that the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- may not be able to accomplish much .
profound disagreements between several of the nations combined with the political weakness of some participants means that few expect the g8 meetings to go beyond a series of well-intentioned statements on some of the world 's most pressing topics .
climate change remains on the agenda ahead of the conference , diplomats around the world have been debating a replacement for the kyoto protocol on climate change , which expires in 2012 .
but japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said on june 17 that no agreement on medium-term goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached at the g8 .
efforts to get member countries to agree on a next step have long been hindered by a clash between the world 's biggest polluters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect another kyoto protocol , some analysts warn four members - european union heavyweights germany , britain , france and italy - have already pledged to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent of 1990 levels no matter what the world does , and 30 percent if other major powers do the same .
but the united states , which has refused to ratify kyoto out of fears that it could harm its economy , says a new deal would be ineffective if rapidly developing countries - and potential rivals such as india and china - were not held to the same standards .
" unless china and india are at the table and unless they agree to the goal ... then i do n't see how any international agreement can be effective , " us president george w bush told eu officials at an eu-us summit in slovenia earlier this month .
who should lead the way ?
those developing economies hit back , arguing that it is unfair to ask them to make expensive changes to their industrial models if the west is not going to do the same .
and those western countries which have signed on are struggling to fulfill the terms of the pact .
the most recent figures from the eu 's emissions-monitoring scheme , released on april 2 , showed that in 2007 the industrial plants and power stations of germany and britain not only failed to cut emissions : they boosted them , by 1.88 and 2.16 percent respectively .
france and italy , the other eu members of the g8 , only managed negligible cuts - 0.27 percent and 0.47 percent respectively .
that failure by germany and britain - two of the most vocal advocates for international deals to cut emissions - could well end up as their achilles heel in climate talks .
it also leaves russia holding the cards , as analysts are unsure how new president dmitry medvedev will react .
moscow 's belated support tipped the balance to bring the kyoto protocol into effect in 2005 .
others warn , however , that the resurgent state could say its reviving industrial base should not be hampered by western-imposed emissions caps .
a weakened world economy should be top priority though environmentalists might like to see climate change at the top of the agenda at this year 's meeting as it was at last year 's , the japanese summit is set against the backdrop of growing fears worldwide about rising interest rates and resurgent inflation .
climate change may have to take a backseat to the globe 's weakening economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are struggling to cope with higher food prices at a pre-summit meeting on june 14 , g8 finance ministers warned that the international economy faces headwinds amid concerns that contracting growth and rising inflation means that the specter of 1970 's-style stagflation could be on the horizon .
" a benign outcome does not look very likely , " kenneth wattret , bnp paribas ' chief eurozone economist told the dpa news agency .
annual inflation in the eu 's 15-member eurozone surged to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent in may , largely due to rising food and oil prices .
to ward off these inflationary pressures triggered by spiraling oil and food prices , the european central bank is expected to hike interest rates in the days leading up to the summit .
bleak prospects while inflation in china eased to a still high 7.7 percent in may , prices in india jumped to a 13-year high of 11.05 percent for the week ending june 7 .
in parts of central europe , inflation tops 17 percent . meanwhile , hundreds of millions of poor people around the world face a bleak prospect as the most basic commodities become more and more expensive .
such an uncertain economic environment is hardly conducive to the world 's leading trade powers reaching a conclusion in the so-called doha round on agricultural subsidies .
g8 finance ministers expressed concern at the growth of consumer prices , but disagreed over its root causes .
italy 's giulio tremonti was among those pointing a finger at speculators , while us treasury secretary henry paulson said the influence of speculation was negligible .
" it is a complicated issue which can not be solved in the short term , " japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said of rising food and oil prices , adding that the g8 planned to " set the direction by sending a message .

japan , the host of the g8 summit , has called an " outreach " session on wednesday on how to tackle climate change .
among the participants is also chinese president hu jintao who is pressing the rich industrial nations to adopt concrete short and medium-term targets to curb the output of greenhouse gases , a major cause of global warming . china ’ s carbon-driven economy has been growing at double digits in recent years .
some scientists believe china has already overtaken the united states as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
hence , the country is facing mounting pressure to cut emissions .
ma jun , the head of the chinese public and environment research center in beijing describes the measures china has taken to tackle the global challenge .
this includes a national plan that the government introduced last year : “ we have a responsibility to the world to reduce our emissions and china wants to be regarded as a responsible country .
china has already taken some actions , for example , the inclusion of energy efficiency and pollution-reducing policies in the new five year plan .
within five years we aim to up-grade the efficiency of energy consumption by at least four percent and reduce major pollutant discharges by 10 percent . ”
open to discussions china refuses so far to accept binding targets for emissions , saying the international community should respect its right to develop .
though it is not a member of g-8 industrialized countries whose leaders are meeting in northern japan this week , it has been invited to give its views on tackling the issue .
last week , su wei , director-general of the office of china ’ s national leading group on climate change said that beijing was ready to discuss any issues about responding to climate change .
this includes discussions on long-term commitments and on setting targets for different industrial sectors , a proposal put forward by japan .
environment expert ma jun again : “ developed countries are mainly responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced in the past 150-200 years .
this is a historic problem and developed countries should take responsibility and show leadership in cutting emissions .
we will also shoulder our share of responsibilities , but with an approach which is different from the kyoto protocol and other un regulations . ”
demand for a fair treaty in 1997 , representatives from 149 countries approved the kyoto protocol with an aim to control the carbon emissions in developed countries .
under the protocol developed countries were required to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases by an average of five percent below their 1990 levels by 2010 .
but there has hardly been significant progress .
the pact also suffered a massive blow when the us pulled out of it in 2001 , saying implementing it would have a huge impact on its economy .
as the kyoto protocol is expiring in 2012 , the international community is struggling to reach a consensus on a new treaty .
rich nations have been demanding that emerging economies such as china to also commit to emission cuts , a demand unacceptable to beijing so far .
ma jun explains : “ we need a fair global agreement .
and for that some big emitting countries are required to make changes and developing countries should also set up their own carbon emission reduction goals . ”
at the same time , ma jun also insists that developed and developing countries should also cooperate and share technologies . rose ting 07/07/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

" hitler represents a decisive part of berlin 's history which we ca n't just pretend did not happen , " the company said in a statement .
a 41-year-old man broke the head off the figure after he had been egged on by drinking mates in a bar .
german public broadcaster ard said tussaud 's was likely to improve security at the amusement on berlin 's unter den linden boulevard .
no call for speedy repairs but a leader of germany 's main jewish group said monday he saw no pressing need to repair the figure .
" i would not be unhappy if the effigy did not come back , " said stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews .
public figures have been careful not to directly acclaim the attack by frank l. , who faces a criminal damage charge .
the self-confessed attacker has told german newspapers he once worked as a policeman in berlin , but decided that work did not suit his punk-music-influenced lifestyle .
he was unemployed for several years before being trained to care for old people in a home .
he said friends in a bar had discussed wrecking the effigy and he had boasted he would do it , leaving him little choice .
he said he spent hours plucking up courage to carry out the attack .
police have not confirmed if the barroom motive is true .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .
" i think we 've got a signal from the american side that they are ready to negotiate , " paszkowski told tvn 24 .
poland reluctant to commit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tusk said no deal has been made washington has been concerned that poland is getting cold feet on plans to station 10 missiles there to ward off potential attacks by " rogue " states such as iran .
the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .
warsaw wants defense system polish prime minister donald tusk 's government has been lobbying washington to provide a thaad , or patriot-type air defense system in exchange for hosting the silos .
tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .
russia remains opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have agreed to disagree on the issue russia has express displeasure with the idea of having a us missile shield next door .
in recent months , the kremlin has softened its rhetoric and has focused instead on getting security guarantees .
but russia 's new president , medvedev , laid out his opposition to the idea in a meeting with us president george w. bush .
the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .
" while there 's some areas of disagreement , there 's also areas where i know we can work together for the common good , " bush said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .
" i think we 've got a signal from the american side that they are ready to negotiate , " paszkowski told tvn 24 .
poland reluctant to commit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tusk said no deal has been made washington has been concerned that poland is getting cold feet on plans to station 10 missiles there to ward off potential attacks by " rogue " states such as iran .
the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .
warsaw wants defense system polish prime minister donald tusk 's government has been lobbying washington to provide a thaad , or patriot-type air defense system in exchange for hosting the silos .
tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .
russia remains opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have agreed to disagree on the issue russia has express displeasure with the idea of having a us missile shield next door .
in recent months , the kremlin has softened its rhetoric and has focused instead on getting security guarantees .
but russia 's new president , medvedev , laid out his opposition to the idea in a meeting with us president george w. bush .
the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .
" while there 's some areas of disagreement , there 's also areas where i know we can work together for the common good , " bush said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.07.2008 new german marriage law causes controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law removes the need for a civil ceremony in germany , marriage has been controlled by the state for over a century , with religious ceremonies optional .
a new law should change all that , but it 's raising some questions - especially among immigrants . german couples will soon be able to get married in church without first going through a civil ceremony in the registry office for the first time in 130 years .
the new rules were recently announced with several other changes to the personenstandsrecht , or law of civil status , and take effect starting in january 2009 . civil marriages were introduced in germany in 1875 , when purely religious unions were made illegal .
couples are still allowed to marry in churches , synagogues and other religious institutions , but only after first having a civil ceremony .
priests had faced the possibility of jail or being fined for marrying couples who had not concluded a civil marriage before going to the altar , although in recent years the offence has been treated as a minor misdemeanor . going backwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the the new rules will lead to multiple and forced marriages many are unhappy with the changes , including seyran ates , a lawyer and women 's rights activist .
she has criticized the new laws , telling the german daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that they will open the floodgates for multiple and forced marriages among muslims .
under islamic law , a man is allowed to be married to four separate women at any one time .
however , women and children have very few rights in purely religious unions . " from now on , a practice that is forbidden in turkey can take place freely here , " ates said . the head of central council of ex-muslims , mina ahadi , has characterized the planned changes as a step backwards .
women are often forced into marriages conducted by imams and have no rights .
ahadi added that in addition to muslim men possibly engaging in multiple unions , this change will also open the door for minors to be taken as brides .
ahadi is calling on the german parliament to reverse the decision . politicians speak out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly wed couple emerges from the church members of the german parliament , or bundestag , say that it wo n't just be muslim men who abuse the system .
max stadler , a representative from the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party said that the state does much more than hand out marriage certificates .
under german law , proof that a former marriage is completely dissolved must be shown prior to a civil union . left party member wolfgang neskovic warned that the new law may lead to " bizarre discrepancies , " especially if a couple chooses to have both a civil and religious wedding .

the pilots want better pay , and the passengers are feeling the crunch . german pilots on a 24 hour strike have forced the cancellation of more than 600 cityline and eurowings flights on monday .
thousands of passengers were given the option of finding other flights or using the german rail system .
lufthansa , which owns the two airlines , is not releasing the exact number of passengers affected , though the biggest impact was at the major german airports in frankfurt , munich and düsseldorf . the pilots ' union cockpit called some 1,000 pilots at cityline and eurowings out on a 24-hour strike that was to end at midnight monday .
the union maintains that the companies have not presented an offer worthy of negotiations in the current round of pay talks . the head of tariff policies at cockpit , ilona ritter , told ap that the pilots ’ union was waiting for “ the airlines to move on their demands and come up with an offer . ” lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said that an offer has been on the table for the past four weeks . more strikes in the works lufthansa was also holding negotiations with the labor union ver.di concerning some 60,000 ground and cabin crew members .
however , these talks fell apart last week with no resolution to the problem .
ver.di has given lufthansa a deadline of wednesday to come up with an offer .
in the event that an agreement can ’ t be made by then , the labor union will vote on whether or not they should strike . call before you fly lufthansa is expressing regret over the strike , urging passengers to call before heading to the airport and , if possible , to drive or take the train .
lufthansa spokeswoman renate hocke says the airline finds it “ very unfortunate that passengers are bearing the brunt of this . ” cityline is a subsidiary of lufthansa , which also holds a 49 percent stake eurowings .
together the two airlines transport some 18 million passengers a year all across europe .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.07.2008 new german marriage law causes controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law removes the need for a civil ceremony in germany , marriage has been controlled by the state for over a century , with religious ceremonies optional .
a new law should change all that , but it 's raising some questions - especially among immigrants . german couples will soon be able to get married in church without first going through a civil ceremony in the registry office for the first time in 130 years .
the new rules were recently announced with several other changes to the personenstandsrecht , or law of civil status , and take effect starting in january 2009 . civil marriages were introduced in germany in 1875 , when purely religious unions were made illegal .
couples are still allowed to marry in churches , synagogues and other religious institutions , but only after first having a civil ceremony .
priests had faced the possibility of jail or being fined for marrying couples who had not concluded a civil marriage before going to the altar , although in recent years the offence has been treated as a minor misdemeanor . going backwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the the new rules will lead to multiple and forced marriages many are unhappy with the changes , including seyran ates , a lawyer and women 's rights activist .
she has criticized the new laws , telling the german daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that they will open the floodgates for multiple and forced marriages among muslims .
under islamic law , a man is allowed to be married to four separate women at any one time .
however , women and children have very few rights in purely religious unions . " from now on , a practice that is forbidden in turkey can take place freely here , " ates said . the head of central council of ex-muslims , mina ahadi , has characterized the planned changes as a step backwards .
women are often forced into marriages conducted by imams and have no rights .
ahadi added that in addition to muslim men possibly engaging in multiple unions , this change will also open the door for minors to be taken as brides .
ahadi is calling on the german parliament to reverse the decision . politicians speak out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly wed couple emerges from the church members of the german parliament , or bundestag , say that it wo n't just be muslim men who abuse the system .
max stadler , a representative from the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party said that the state does much more than hand out marriage certificates .
under german law , proof that a former marriage is completely dissolved must be shown prior to a civil union . left party member wolfgang neskovic warned that the new law may lead to " bizarre discrepancies , " especially if a couple chooses to have both a civil and religious wedding . " in the event of both a civil and religious double marriage then one is , for all intents and purposes , married to two partners , " he added . new law not finalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of couples get married in germany every year there does seem to be some hope for the critics .
social democrat dieter wiefelspuetz , a member of the bundestag , has called for a review of the new legislation after the summer break . wiefelspuetz warned that if even just a fraction of the apprehensions that have been expressed becomes a reality , then the social structure of the nation will experience a massive backslide . despite the new rules , all couples choosing to tie the knot in church only should beware .
their marriage has little legal force : rights of inheritance , tax advantages , support in case of divorce and other standard rights of next-of-kin can not be legally enforced . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .
even so , rubisch forecast : " from now on only moderate gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth can be expected . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hitler represents a decisive part of berlin 's history which we ca n't just pretend did not happen , " the company said in a statement .
a 41-year-old man broke the head off the figure after he had been egged on by drinking mates in a bar .
german public broadcaster ard said tussaud 's was likely to improve security at the amusement on berlin 's unter den linden boulevard .
no call for speedy repairs but a leader of germany 's main jewish group said monday he saw no pressing need to repair the figure .
" i would not be unhappy if the effigy did not come back , " said stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews .
public figures have been careful not to directly acclaim the attack by frank l. , who faces a criminal damage charge .
the self-confessed attacker has told german newspapers he once worked as a policeman in berlin , but decided that work did not suit his punk-music-influenced lifestyle .
he was unemployed for several years before being trained to care for old people in a home .
he said friends in a bar had discussed wrecking the effigy and he had boasted he would do it , leaving him little choice .
he said he spent hours plucking up courage to carry out the attack .
police have not confirmed if the barroom motive is true .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .

" serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .

" nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .
even so , rubisch forecast : " from now on only moderate gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth can be expected . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .
" i think we 've got a signal from the american side that they are ready to negotiate , " paszkowski told tvn 24 .
poland reluctant to commit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tusk said no deal has been made washington has been concerned that poland is getting cold feet on plans to station 10 missiles there to ward off potential attacks by " rogue " states such as iran .
the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .
warsaw wants defense system polish prime minister donald tusk 's government has been lobbying washington to provide a thaad , or patriot-type air defense system in exchange for hosting the silos .
tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .

in recent months , the kremlin has softened its rhetoric and has focused instead on getting security guarantees .
but russia 's new president , medvedev , laid out his opposition to the idea in a meeting with us president george w. bush .
the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "

as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "
france , italy reconsidering aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent months the world bank has estimated that about $ 10 billion in emergency aid is needed to help poor countries deal with a global food and fuel price increase .
as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi recently announced plans to cut italian development aid by 170 million euros annually for the next three years .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong .

" serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa .

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .

the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .
warsaw wants defense system polish prime minister donald tusk 's government has been lobbying washington to provide a thaad , or patriot-type air defense system in exchange for hosting the silos .
tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .

in recent months , the kremlin has softened its rhetoric and has focused instead on getting security guarantees .
but russia 's new president , medvedev , laid out his opposition to the idea in a meeting with us president george w. bush .
the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .
lingering anger over eu treaty comments gusenbauer and faymann enraged their junior coalition partner when they announced their intention to hold popular votes on future eu treaties in a letter to austria 's biggest newspaper in late june without informing the conservatives .
molterer said that the social democrats had left the common ground of the coalition agreement and called for a " european perspective for our country . "

a 41-year-old man broke the head off the figure after he had been egged on by drinking mates in a bar .
german public broadcaster ard said tussaud 's was likely to improve security at the amusement on berlin 's unter den linden boulevard .
no call for speedy repairs but a leader of germany 's main jewish group said monday he saw no pressing need to repair the figure .
" i would not be unhappy if the effigy did not come back , " said stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews .
public figures have been careful not to directly acclaim the attack by frank l. , who faces a criminal damage charge .
the self-confessed attacker has told german newspapers he once worked as a policeman in berlin , but decided that work did not suit his punk-music-influenced lifestyle .
he was unemployed for several years before being trained to care for old people in a home .
he said friends in a bar had discussed wrecking the effigy and he had boasted he would do it , leaving him little choice .
he said he spent hours plucking up courage to carry out the attack .
police have not confirmed if the barroom motive is true .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .

the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .

tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .

the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .

" hitler represents a decisive part of berlin 's history which we ca n't just pretend did not happen , " the company said in a statement .
a 41-year-old man broke the head off the figure after he had been egged on by drinking mates in a bar .
german public broadcaster ard said tussaud 's was likely to improve security at the amusement on berlin 's unter den linden boulevard .
no call for speedy repairs but a leader of germany 's main jewish group said monday he saw no pressing need to repair the figure .
" i would not be unhappy if the effigy did not come back , " said stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews .
public figures have been careful not to directly acclaim the attack by frank l. , who faces a criminal damage charge .
the self-confessed attacker has told german newspapers he once worked as a policeman in berlin , but decided that work did not suit his punk-music-influenced lifestyle .
he was unemployed for several years before being trained to care for old people in a home .
he said friends in a bar had discussed wrecking the effigy and he had boasted he would do it , leaving him little choice .
he said he spent hours plucking up courage to carry out the attack .
police have not confirmed if the barroom motive is true .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g8 leaders tackle global issues g8 summit ends with pledges on food , oil and the climate g8 leaders agree to halve emissions by 2050 g8 promises steps against zimbabwe but divisions remain africa 's plight dominates first day of g8 summit nuclear power -pipe- 07.07.2008 germany in hot seat as g8 pushes nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 powers are pushing nuclear as an alternative amid spiraling oil and gas prices moves to boost the role of nuclear power in the global energy mix at this week 's summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations could be the most difficult issue for german chancellor merkel . indeed , merkel goes into the talks with g8 leaders saddled with a law passed by germany 's former social democrat-led -lrb- spd -rrb- government aimed out phasing out nuclear power by 2021 , which she is opposed to . this now forms part of the coalition agreement her conservative christian democrat-led political bloc forged with the spd about three years ago to form the government she now heads . but with italy 's elections in april paving the way for a more pro-nuclear coalition headed by silvio berlusconi , germany is now the only member of the g8 club resisting expanding nuclear power as part of efforts to address the threat posed by global warming . ready for a nuclear rethink ? however , sensing a shift in the public mood in germany about extending the life of the nation 's remaining 17 nuclear reactors , merkel and her supporters have attempted to fire up a fresh campaign for a german rethink on phasing out atomic power in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear is still strong in germany , but it is weakening amid spiraling oil and gas prices , an opinion poll commissioned by german public broadcaster ard and released this month found that 51 percent wanted the nation to continue along the path to phasing out nuclear energy . but 44 percent of those polled by the pollsters infratest dimap wanted a reconsideration .
this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "

anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pilots want better pay , and the passengers are feeling the crunch . german pilots on a 24 hour strike have forced the cancellation of more than 600 cityline and eurowings flights on monday .
thousands of passengers were given the option of finding other flights or using the german rail system .
lufthansa , which owns the two airlines , is not releasing the exact number of passengers affected , though the biggest impact was at the major german airports in frankfurt , munich and düsseldorf . the pilots ' union cockpit called some 1,000 pilots at cityline and eurowings out on a 24-hour strike that was to end at midnight monday .
the union maintains that the companies have not presented an offer worthy of negotiations in the current round of pay talks . the head of tariff policies at cockpit , ilona ritter , told ap that the pilots ’ union was waiting for “ the airlines to move on their demands and come up with an offer . ” lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said that an offer has been on the table for the past four weeks . more strikes in the works lufthansa was also holding negotiations with the labor union ver.di concerning some 60,000 ground and cabin crew members .
however , these talks fell apart last week with no resolution to the problem .
ver.di has given lufthansa a deadline of wednesday to come up with an offer .
in the event that an agreement can ’ t be made by then , the labor union will vote on whether or not they should strike . call before you fly lufthansa is expressing regret over the strike , urging passengers to call before heading to the airport and , if possible , to drive or take the train .
lufthansa spokeswoman renate hocke says the airline finds it “ very unfortunate that passengers are bearing the brunt of this . ” cityline is a subsidiary of lufthansa , which also holds a 49 percent stake eurowings .
together the two airlines transport some 18 million passengers a year all across europe .
regular lufthansa flights , including international , will not be affected by the strike . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .

japan , the host of the g8 summit , has called an " outreach " session on wednesday on how to tackle climate change .
among the participants is also chinese president hu jintao who is pressing the rich industrial nations to adopt concrete short and medium-term targets to curb the output of greenhouse gases , a major cause of global warming . china ’ s carbon-driven economy has been growing at double digits in recent years .
some scientists believe china has already overtaken the united states as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
hence , the country is facing mounting pressure to cut emissions .
ma jun , the head of the chinese public and environment research center in beijing describes the measures china has taken to tackle the global challenge .
this includes a national plan that the government introduced last year : “ we have a responsibility to the world to reduce our emissions and china wants to be regarded as a responsible country .
china has already taken some actions , for example , the inclusion of energy efficiency and pollution-reducing policies in the new five year plan .
within five years we aim to up-grade the efficiency of energy consumption by at least four percent and reduce major pollutant discharges by 10 percent . ”
open to discussions china refuses so far to accept binding targets for emissions , saying the international community should respect its right to develop .
though it is not a member of g-8 industrialized countries whose leaders are meeting in northern japan this week , it has been invited to give its views on tackling the issue .
last week , su wei , director-general of the office of china ’ s national leading group on climate change said that beijing was ready to discuss any issues about responding to climate change .
this includes discussions on long-term commitments and on setting targets for different industrial sectors , a proposal put forward by japan .
environment expert ma jun again : “ developed countries are mainly responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced in the past 150-200 years .
this is a historic problem and developed countries should take responsibility and show leadership in cutting emissions .
we will also shoulder our share of responsibilities , but with an approach which is different from the kyoto protocol and other un regulations . ”
demand for a fair treaty in 1997 , representatives from 149 countries approved the kyoto protocol with an aim to control the carbon emissions in developed countries .
under the protocol developed countries were required to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases by an average of five percent below their 1990 levels by 2010 .

japan , the host of the g8 summit , has called an " outreach " session on wednesday on how to tackle climate change .
among the participants is also chinese president hu jintao who is pressing the rich industrial nations to adopt concrete short and medium-term targets to curb the output of greenhouse gases , a major cause of global warming . china ’ s carbon-driven economy has been growing at double digits in recent years .
some scientists believe china has already overtaken the united states as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
hence , the country is facing mounting pressure to cut emissions .
ma jun , the head of the chinese public and environment research center in beijing describes the measures china has taken to tackle the global challenge .
this includes a national plan that the government introduced last year : “ we have a responsibility to the world to reduce our emissions and china wants to be regarded as a responsible country .
china has already taken some actions , for example , the inclusion of energy efficiency and pollution-reducing policies in the new five year plan .
within five years we aim to up-grade the efficiency of energy consumption by at least four percent and reduce major pollutant discharges by 10 percent . ”
open to discussions china refuses so far to accept binding targets for emissions , saying the international community should respect its right to develop .
though it is not a member of g-8 industrialized countries whose leaders are meeting in northern japan this week , it has been invited to give its views on tackling the issue .
last week , su wei , director-general of the office of china ’ s national leading group on climate change said that beijing was ready to discuss any issues about responding to climate change .
this includes discussions on long-term commitments and on setting targets for different industrial sectors , a proposal put forward by japan .
environment expert ma jun again : “ developed countries are mainly responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced in the past 150-200 years .
this is a historic problem and developed countries should take responsibility and show leadership in cutting emissions .
we will also shoulder our share of responsibilities , but with an approach which is different from the kyoto protocol and other un regulations . ”
demand for a fair treaty in 1997 , representatives from 149 countries approved the kyoto protocol with an aim to control the carbon emissions in developed countries .
under the protocol developed countries were required to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases by an average of five percent below their 1990 levels by 2010 .
but there has hardly been significant progress .
the pact also suffered a massive blow when the us pulled out of it in 2001 , saying implementing it would have a huge impact on its economy .

they 'll be joined this year by delegates from australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa .
climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .
it 's an ambitious undertaking for a three-day summit and already there are signs that the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- may not be able to accomplish much .
profound disagreements between several of the nations combined with the political weakness of some participants means that few expect the g8 meetings to go beyond a series of well-intentioned statements on some of the world 's most pressing topics .
climate change remains on the agenda ahead of the conference , diplomats around the world have been debating a replacement for the kyoto protocol on climate change , which expires in 2012 .
but japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said on june 17 that no agreement on medium-term goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached at the g8 .
efforts to get member countries to agree on a next step have long been hindered by a clash between the world 's biggest polluters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect another kyoto protocol , some analysts warn four members - european union heavyweights germany , britain , france and italy - have already pledged to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent of 1990 levels no matter what the world does , and 30 percent if other major powers do the same .
but the united states , which has refused to ratify kyoto out of fears that it could harm its economy , says a new deal would be ineffective if rapidly developing countries - and potential rivals such as india and china - were not held to the same standards .
" unless china and india are at the table and unless they agree to the goal ... then i do n't see how any international agreement can be effective , " us president george w bush told eu officials at an eu-us summit in slovenia earlier this month .
who should lead the way ?
those developing economies hit back , arguing that it is unfair to ask them to make expensive changes to their industrial models if the west is not going to do the same .
and those western countries which have signed on are struggling to fulfill the terms of the pact .
the most recent figures from the eu 's emissions-monitoring scheme , released on april 2 , showed that in 2007 the industrial plants and power stations of germany and britain not only failed to cut emissions : they boosted them , by 1.88 and 2.16 percent respectively .
france and italy , the other eu members of the g8 , only managed negligible cuts - 0.27 percent and 0.47 percent respectively .
that failure by germany and britain - two of the most vocal advocates for international deals to cut emissions - could well end up as their achilles heel in climate talks .
it also leaves russia holding the cards , as analysts are unsure how new president dmitry medvedev will react .
moscow 's belated support tipped the balance to bring the kyoto protocol into effect in 2005 .
others warn , however , that the resurgent state could say its reviving industrial base should not be hampered by western-imposed emissions caps .
a weakened world economy should be top priority though environmentalists might like to see climate change at the top of the agenda at this year 's meeting as it was at last year 's , the japanese summit is set against the backdrop of growing fears worldwide about rising interest rates and resurgent inflation .
climate change may have to take a backseat to the globe 's weakening economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are struggling to cope with higher food prices at a pre-summit meeting on june 14 , g8 finance ministers warned that the international economy faces headwinds amid concerns that contracting growth and rising inflation means that the specter of 1970 's-style stagflation could be on the horizon .
" a benign outcome does not look very likely , " kenneth wattret , bnp paribas ' chief eurozone economist told the dpa news agency .
annual inflation in the eu 's 15-member eurozone surged to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent in may , largely due to rising food and oil prices .
to ward off these inflationary pressures triggered by spiraling oil and food prices , the european central bank is expected to hike interest rates in the days leading up to the summit .
bleak prospects while inflation in china eased to a still high 7.7 percent in may , prices in india jumped to a 13-year high of 11.05 percent for the week ending june 7 .
in parts of central europe , inflation tops 17 percent . meanwhile , hundreds of millions of poor people around the world face a bleak prospect as the most basic commodities become more and more expensive .
such an uncertain economic environment is hardly conducive to the world 's leading trade powers reaching a conclusion in the so-called doha round on agricultural subsidies .
g8 finance ministers expressed concern at the growth of consumer prices , but disagreed over its root causes .
italy 's giulio tremonti was among those pointing a finger at speculators , while us treasury secretary henry paulson said the influence of speculation was negligible .
" it is a complicated issue which can not be solved in the short term , " japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said of rising food and oil prices , adding that the g8 planned to " set the direction by sending a message .

they 'll be joined this year by delegates from australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa .
climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .
it 's an ambitious undertaking for a three-day summit and already there are signs that the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- may not be able to accomplish much .
profound disagreements between several of the nations combined with the political weakness of some participants means that few expect the g8 meetings to go beyond a series of well-intentioned statements on some of the world 's most pressing topics .
climate change remains on the agenda ahead of the conference , diplomats around the world have been debating a replacement for the kyoto protocol on climate change , which expires in 2012 .
but japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said on june 17 that no agreement on medium-term goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached at the g8 .
efforts to get member countries to agree on a next step have long been hindered by a clash between the world 's biggest polluters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect another kyoto protocol , some analysts warn four members - european union heavyweights germany , britain , france and italy - have already pledged to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent of 1990 levels no matter what the world does , and 30 percent if other major powers do the same .
but the united states , which has refused to ratify kyoto out of fears that it could harm its economy , says a new deal would be ineffective if rapidly developing countries - and potential rivals such as india and china - were not held to the same standards .
" unless china and india are at the table and unless they agree to the goal ... then i do n't see how any international agreement can be effective , " us president george w bush told eu officials at an eu-us summit in slovenia earlier this month .
who should lead the way ?
those developing economies hit back , arguing that it is unfair to ask them to make expensive changes to their industrial models if the west is not going to do the same .
and those western countries which have signed on are struggling to fulfill the terms of the pact .
the most recent figures from the eu 's emissions-monitoring scheme , released on april 2 , showed that in 2007 the industrial plants and power stations of germany and britain not only failed to cut emissions : they boosted them , by 1.88 and 2.16 percent respectively .
france and italy , the other eu members of the g8 , only managed negligible cuts - 0.27 percent and 0.47 percent respectively .
that failure by germany and britain - two of the most vocal advocates for international deals to cut emissions - could well end up as their achilles heel in climate talks .
it also leaves russia holding the cards , as analysts are unsure how new president dmitry medvedev will react .
moscow 's belated support tipped the balance to bring the kyoto protocol into effect in 2005 .
others warn , however , that the resurgent state could say its reviving industrial base should not be hampered by western-imposed emissions caps .
a weakened world economy should be top priority though environmentalists might like to see climate change at the top of the agenda at this year 's meeting as it was at last year 's , the japanese summit is set against the backdrop of growing fears worldwide about rising interest rates and resurgent inflation .
climate change may have to take a backseat to the globe 's weakening economy .

they 'll be joined this year by delegates from australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa .
climate change , the globe 's weakening economy and rising food and oil costs will top the agenda .
it 's an ambitious undertaking for a three-day summit and already there are signs that the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- may not be able to accomplish much .
profound disagreements between several of the nations combined with the political weakness of some participants means that few expect the g8 meetings to go beyond a series of well-intentioned statements on some of the world 's most pressing topics .
climate change remains on the agenda ahead of the conference , diplomats around the world have been debating a replacement for the kyoto protocol on climate change , which expires in 2012 .
but japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said on june 17 that no agreement on medium-term goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be reached at the g8 .
efforts to get member countries to agree on a next step have long been hindered by a clash between the world 's biggest polluters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't expect another kyoto protocol , some analysts warn four members - european union heavyweights germany , britain , france and italy - have already pledged to cut their emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent of 1990 levels no matter what the world does , and 30 percent if other major powers do the same .
but the united states , which has refused to ratify kyoto out of fears that it could harm its economy , says a new deal would be ineffective if rapidly developing countries - and potential rivals such as india and china - were not held to the same standards .
" unless china and india are at the table and unless they agree to the goal ... then i do n't see how any international agreement can be effective , " us president george w bush told eu officials at an eu-us summit in slovenia earlier this month .
who should lead the way ?
those developing economies hit back , arguing that it is unfair to ask them to make expensive changes to their industrial models if the west is not going to do the same .
and those western countries which have signed on are struggling to fulfill the terms of the pact .
the most recent figures from the eu 's emissions-monitoring scheme , released on april 2 , showed that in 2007 the industrial plants and power stations of germany and britain not only failed to cut emissions : they boosted them , by 1.88 and 2.16 percent respectively .
france and italy , the other eu members of the g8 , only managed negligible cuts - 0.27 percent and 0.47 percent respectively .
that failure by germany and britain - two of the most vocal advocates for international deals to cut emissions - could well end up as their achilles heel in climate talks .
it also leaves russia holding the cards , as analysts are unsure how new president dmitry medvedev will react .
moscow 's belated support tipped the balance to bring the kyoto protocol into effect in 2005 .
others warn , however , that the resurgent state could say its reviving industrial base should not be hampered by western-imposed emissions caps .
a weakened world economy should be top priority though environmentalists might like to see climate change at the top of the agenda at this year 's meeting as it was at last year 's , the japanese summit is set against the backdrop of growing fears worldwide about rising interest rates and resurgent inflation .
climate change may have to take a backseat to the globe 's weakening economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are struggling to cope with higher food prices at a pre-summit meeting on june 14 , g8 finance ministers warned that the international economy faces headwinds amid concerns that contracting growth and rising inflation means that the specter of 1970 's-style stagflation could be on the horizon .
" a benign outcome does not look very likely , " kenneth wattret , bnp paribas ' chief eurozone economist told the dpa news agency .
annual inflation in the eu 's 15-member eurozone surged to a 16-year high of 3.7 percent in may , largely due to rising food and oil prices .
to ward off these inflationary pressures triggered by spiraling oil and food prices , the european central bank is expected to hike interest rates in the days leading up to the summit .
bleak prospects while inflation in china eased to a still high 7.7 percent in may , prices in india jumped to a 13-year high of 11.05 percent for the week ending june 7 .
in parts of central europe , inflation tops 17 percent . meanwhile , hundreds of millions of poor people around the world face a bleak prospect as the most basic commodities become more and more expensive .
such an uncertain economic environment is hardly conducive to the world 's leading trade powers reaching a conclusion in the so-called doha round on agricultural subsidies .
g8 finance ministers expressed concern at the growth of consumer prices , but disagreed over its root causes .
italy 's giulio tremonti was among those pointing a finger at speculators , while us treasury secretary henry paulson said the influence of speculation was negligible .
" it is a complicated issue which can not be solved in the short term , " japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said of rising food and oil prices , adding that the g8 planned to " set the direction by sending a message .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "
france , italy reconsidering aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent months the world bank has estimated that about $ 10 billion in emergency aid is needed to help poor countries deal with a global food and fuel price increase .
as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "

anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .
lingering anger over eu treaty comments gusenbauer and faymann enraged their junior coalition partner when they announced their intention to hold popular votes on future eu treaties in a letter to austria 's biggest newspaper in late june without informing the conservatives .
molterer said that the social democrats had left the common ground of the coalition agreement and called for a " european perspective for our country . "
the green party and the right-wing freedom party have announced they would support the conservatives in a parliamentary decision on early elections , thus guaranteeing a majority .
the social democrats are expected to issue a formal response monday afternoon . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .

the pilots want better pay , and the passengers are feeling the crunch . german pilots on a 24 hour strike have forced the cancellation of more than 600 cityline and eurowings flights on monday .
thousands of passengers were given the option of finding other flights or using the german rail system .
lufthansa , which owns the two airlines , is not releasing the exact number of passengers affected , though the biggest impact was at the major german airports in frankfurt , munich and düsseldorf . the pilots ' union cockpit called some 1,000 pilots at cityline and eurowings out on a 24-hour strike that was to end at midnight monday .
the union maintains that the companies have not presented an offer worthy of negotiations in the current round of pay talks . the head of tariff policies at cockpit , ilona ritter , told ap that the pilots ’ union was waiting for “ the airlines to move on their demands and come up with an offer . ” lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said that an offer has been on the table for the past four weeks . more strikes in the works lufthansa was also holding negotiations with the labor union ver.di concerning some 60,000 ground and cabin crew members .
however , these talks fell apart last week with no resolution to the problem .
ver.di has given lufthansa a deadline of wednesday to come up with an offer .
in the event that an agreement can ’ t be made by then , the labor union will vote on whether or not they should strike . call before you fly lufthansa is expressing regret over the strike , urging passengers to call before heading to the airport and , if possible , to drive or take the train .
lufthansa spokeswoman renate hocke says the airline finds it “ very unfortunate that passengers are bearing the brunt of this . ” cityline is a subsidiary of lufthansa , which also holds a 49 percent stake eurowings .
together the two airlines transport some 18 million passengers a year all across europe .
regular lufthansa flights , including international , will not be affected by the strike . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g8 leaders tackle global issues g8 summit ends with pledges on food , oil and the climate g8 leaders agree to halve emissions by 2050 g8 promises steps against zimbabwe but divisions remain africa 's plight dominates first day of g8 summit nuclear power -pipe- 07.07.2008 germany in hot seat as g8 pushes nuclear power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 powers are pushing nuclear as an alternative amid spiraling oil and gas prices moves to boost the role of nuclear power in the global energy mix at this week 's summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations could be the most difficult issue for german chancellor merkel . indeed , merkel goes into the talks with g8 leaders saddled with a law passed by germany 's former social democrat-led -lrb- spd -rrb- government aimed out phasing out nuclear power by 2021 , which she is opposed to . this now forms part of the coalition agreement her conservative christian democrat-led political bloc forged with the spd about three years ago to form the government she now heads . but with italy 's elections in april paving the way for a more pro-nuclear coalition headed by silvio berlusconi , germany is now the only member of the g8 club resisting expanding nuclear power as part of efforts to address the threat posed by global warming . ready for a nuclear rethink ? however , sensing a shift in the public mood in germany about extending the life of the nation 's remaining 17 nuclear reactors , merkel and her supporters have attempted to fire up a fresh campaign for a german rethink on phasing out atomic power in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to nuclear is still strong in germany , but it is weakening amid spiraling oil and gas prices , an opinion poll commissioned by german public broadcaster ard and released this month found that 51 percent wanted the nation to continue along the path to phasing out nuclear energy . but 44 percent of those polled by the pollsters infratest dimap wanted a reconsideration .
this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hitler represents a decisive part of berlin 's history which we ca n't just pretend did not happen , " the company said in a statement .
a 41-year-old man broke the head off the figure after he had been egged on by drinking mates in a bar .
german public broadcaster ard said tussaud 's was likely to improve security at the amusement on berlin 's unter den linden boulevard .
no call for speedy repairs but a leader of germany 's main jewish group said monday he saw no pressing need to repair the figure .
" i would not be unhappy if the effigy did not come back , " said stephen kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews .
public figures have been careful not to directly acclaim the attack by frank l. , who faces a criminal damage charge .
the self-confessed attacker has told german newspapers he once worked as a policeman in berlin , but decided that work did not suit his punk-music-influenced lifestyle .
he was unemployed for several years before being trained to care for old people in a home .
he said friends in a bar had discussed wrecking the effigy and he had boasted he would do it , leaving him little choice .
he said he spent hours plucking up courage to carry out the attack .
police have not confirmed if the barroom motive is true .
many germans were upset that hitler was included in a commercial amusement close to the holocaust memorial and other memory sites .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .
approval still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants a fast response barroso 's proposal will need to be formally approved by the european parliament and the eu 's member states , with commission officials expecting this procedure to be completed by november . on monday , borroso also urged g8 leaders not to backtrack on their earlier pledge to raise the amount of annual aid given to the developing world by $ 50 billion by 2010 .
at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .
" we hope it will encourage eu member states to raise their own commitment bilaterally and also encourage the rest of the g8 to do more . "
france , italy reconsidering aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent months the world bank has estimated that about $ 10 billion in emergency aid is needed to help poor countries deal with a global food and fuel price increase .
as for the $ 50 billion pledged by the g8 in 2005 , a compliance panel found that the group will fall $ 40 billion short of its target if current spending plans continue .
anti-poverty groups warned g8 countries against abandoning the previous aid promise .
that would be a " betrayal of the promise , " oxfam said .
" we desperately need to see more money , and it has to be new money , " max lawson of oxfam told the dpa news agency .
" the $ 50 billion are absolutely critical . "
activists accused france , italy and canada of skimping on aid to africa .
oxfam praised germany , britain and the united states for raising their share of aid .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi recently announced plans to cut italian development aid by 170 million euros annually for the next three years .

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.07.2008 new german marriage law causes controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law removes the need for a civil ceremony in germany , marriage has been controlled by the state for over a century , with religious ceremonies optional .
a new law should change all that , but it 's raising some questions - especially among immigrants . german couples will soon be able to get married in church without first going through a civil ceremony in the registry office for the first time in 130 years .
the new rules were recently announced with several other changes to the personenstandsrecht , or law of civil status , and take effect starting in january 2009 . civil marriages were introduced in germany in 1875 , when purely religious unions were made illegal .
couples are still allowed to marry in churches , synagogues and other religious institutions , but only after first having a civil ceremony .
priests had faced the possibility of jail or being fined for marrying couples who had not concluded a civil marriage before going to the altar , although in recent years the offence has been treated as a minor misdemeanor . going backwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear the the new rules will lead to multiple and forced marriages many are unhappy with the changes , including seyran ates , a lawyer and women 's rights activist .
she has criticized the new laws , telling the german daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung that they will open the floodgates for multiple and forced marriages among muslims .
under islamic law , a man is allowed to be married to four separate women at any one time .
however , women and children have very few rights in purely religious unions . " from now on , a practice that is forbidden in turkey can take place freely here , " ates said . the head of central council of ex-muslims , mina ahadi , has characterized the planned changes as a step backwards .
women are often forced into marriages conducted by imams and have no rights .
ahadi added that in addition to muslim men possibly engaging in multiple unions , this change will also open the door for minors to be taken as brides .
ahadi is calling on the german parliament to reverse the decision . politicians speak out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly wed couple emerges from the church members of the german parliament , or bundestag , say that it wo n't just be muslim men who abuse the system .
max stadler , a representative from the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party said that the state does much more than hand out marriage certificates .
under german law , proof that a former marriage is completely dissolved must be shown prior to a civil union . left party member wolfgang neskovic warned that the new law may lead to " bizarre discrepancies , " especially if a couple chooses to have both a civil and religious wedding . " in the event of both a civil and religious double marriage then one is , for all intents and purposes , married to two partners , " he added . new law not finalized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of couples get married in germany every year there does seem to be some hope for the critics .
social democrat dieter wiefelspuetz , a member of the bundestag , has called for a review of the new legislation after the summer break . wiefelspuetz warned that if even just a fraction of the apprehensions that have been expressed becomes a reality , then the social structure of the nation will experience a massive backslide . despite the new rules , all couples choosing to tie the knot in church only should beware .
their marriage has little legal force : rights of inheritance , tax advantages , support in case of divorce and other standard rights of next-of-kin can not be legally enforced . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .
even so , rubisch forecast : " from now on only moderate gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth can be expected . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .
lingering anger over eu treaty comments gusenbauer and faymann enraged their junior coalition partner when they announced their intention to hold popular votes on future eu treaties in a letter to austria 's biggest newspaper in late june without informing the conservatives .
molterer said that the social democrats had left the common ground of the coalition agreement and called for a " european perspective for our country . "
the green party and the right-wing freedom party have announced they would support the conservatives in a parliamentary decision on early elections , thus guaranteeing a majority .

" high food prices are already turning back the clock on development gains .
to avoid further suffering , we are calling on world leaders to deliver a full range of immediate needs , including food assistance , " said ban . " the world faces three simultaneous crises - a food crisis , a climate crisis and a development crisis , " ban told reporters .
" the three crises are deeply interconnected and need to be addressed as such . " " summits can not solve all the world 's ills ... but i believe this summit can make an important start , here and now , to focus on the needs of the most vulnerable , " zoellick added . merkel demands action on food and fuel crises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a cap on rising food and fuel prices german chancellor angela merkel said the african leaders demanded action as the global food and fuel crisis has hit the continent 's most vulnerable people the hardest . " the african countries expressed their fears that many of the millennium development goals will be more difficult to reach if commodity prices keep rising like they are at the moment , " she told reporters . japanese officials said african leaders had been unanimous in urging the g8 to stick to their 2005 pledge to raise annual aid to developing countries by 50 billion dollars by 2010 . but ban noted that as much as 62 billion dollars per year would be needed by then in order to meet the millennium development goals - a series of un-sponsored targets which include halving the number of starving people by 2015 . the aid group oxfam quoted sources as saying g8 negotiators were late monday deadlocked on the issue of aid promises to africa . the draft text of a communiqué on development does not include a reiteration of a promise by g8 leaders three years ago to provide 50 billion dollars extra in aid by 2010 , half of it earmarked for africa . " we must see the 50 billion dollars aid promise back in the communiqué , " said max lawson of oxfam international . all sides acknowledged that the problem of hunger , spiraling food and oil prices and the impact of global warming are strictly related . energy targets causing strife between members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the g8 countries see nuclear power as a solution but while european union commission president jose manuel barroso urged g8 leaders to agree on " meaningful , " " ambitious " and " binding " long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , germany found itself isolated as the united states , backed by six other g8 members , pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a possible way out . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . " there is no question ... that nuclear energy , responsibly developed by countries capable of managing it , is an essential component of cutting greenhouse gas emissions , " connaughton said . while france , britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of nuclear energy , the german government has only just agreed to phase out its nuclear reactors by 2021 . despite angela merkel , the chancellor , being herself in favor of atomic energy , it is widely unpopular among the german electorate . " nuclear power is not the main factor in trying to protect the environment , " she told german reporters as she moved to prevent the summit from making a reference to nuclear energy in its final communiqué . climate and economy on second day 's agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change will be addressed on the second day climate change was to feature more prominently on tuesday , when g8 leaders were due to turn to the main items on their official agenda . among them is the slowdown in the global economy and accelerating inflation . monday 's opening day was preceded by a series of bilateral meetings , most notably between bush and russian president dmitry medvedev , who was described as " a smart guy " by his american counterpart . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts polled by dow jones newswires had expected the leading indicator to gain 0.8 percent . the decrease was nonetheless an improvement from april , when industrial orders fell by 1.8 percent on a monthly basis .
but for natixis analyst costa brunner , the latest decline " is definitely an alarming sign for the german industry and the economy as a whole . " postbank 's fabienne riefer said the german industrial sector 's " best days are behind it , " while matthias rubisch at commerzbank declared : " the boom in the manufacturing sector is over . " germany falls in line germany , which is also the world 's leading exporter at present , has resisted a slowdown seen in other eurozone countries and the united states but is now headed for a patch of much weaker growth . " western europe now follows the us into a marked downturn , " rubisch said . for brunner , the order data underscored " an accelerating risk to the cooling down of important trading partners . " adding to evidence that the german economy could be heading for a slowdown as the year unfolds , data released last week showed german factory orders falling for the sixth consequence month in may .
slumping production in germany 's key industrial sector and the nation 's building industry lead the overall fall in output , monday 's figures showed . domestic consumption down analysts had expected industrial production to increase by a very modest 0.2 per cent in may .
however , when the two months of april and may are compared to february and march , german output contracted by 1.8 per cent . last week , the german retail federation hde cut its 2008 forecast for domestic consumption growth to 1.5 percent after first-half results came in lower than expected .
it was one of a number of increasing signs that an anticipated pickup this year in german consumption and domestic investment would not occur . but while domestic orders fell by 2.7 percent in may , foreign demand grew by 0.8 percent , a ministry statement said .
exports have still managed to hold up , and german companies report their foreign order books are still fairly full .
even so , rubisch forecast : " from now on only moderate gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth can be expected . " dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president dmitry medvedev made it clear to george w. bush that he is unhappy about the missile shield . polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski was travelling to washington on monday , july 7 to try and elicit guarantees of us military protection for his country .
poland has demanded billions of dollars in us investment to upgrade its air defenses , including patriot ground-to-air missiles .
sikorski will meet with us secretary of state condoleezza rice .
he will also meet republican presidential candidate john mccain and speak to democratic hopeful barack obama by phone , foreign ministry spokesman piotr paszkowski told afp news agency .
" i think we 've got a signal from the american side that they are ready to negotiate , " paszkowski told tvn 24 .
poland reluctant to commit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tusk said no deal has been made washington has been concerned that poland is getting cold feet on plans to station 10 missiles there to ward off potential attacks by " rogue " states such as iran .
the missiles are part of a defense shield that will also include a radar facility in neighboring czech republic .
discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .
the czech government agreed to house the radar base three months ago , but it still has to be ratified by parliament .
" we have n't rejected anything .
the proof is that talks are continuing .
we want to continue this to a happy conclusion .
it 's about reinforcing our security .
we need to consider our interests , " sikorski was quoted as saying by poland 's pap news agency .
warsaw wants defense system polish prime minister donald tusk 's government has been lobbying washington to provide a thaad , or patriot-type air defense system in exchange for hosting the silos .
tusk said a guarantee from washington is all that is missing to move the deal forward .
" we can agree anytime , tomorrow , in a week , in a month , as long as we have real guarantees for our security , " he said .
the us had earlier announced that a " tentative agreement " had been reached , but poland 's defense minister bogdan klich later said that there was no deal .
russia remains opposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they have agreed to disagree on the issue russia has express displeasure with the idea of having a us missile shield next door .
in recent months , the kremlin has softened its rhetoric and has focused instead on getting security guarantees .
but russia 's new president , medvedev , laid out his opposition to the idea in a meeting with us president george w. bush .
the two leaders held talks on the side of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- meeting being held in japan .
" there are certain questions on our agenda where we agree , and these are the matters pertaining to iran , north korea , " medvedev said .
" but then certainly there are others with respect to european affairs and missile defense where we have differences . " medvedev , who frequently referred to the us president as " george , " said he would seek to intensify dialogue with the us during the remaining six months of the bush administration .
bush signalled that he could do business with the new russian president , whom he described as someone who could be trusted .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .

at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .

but critics say it wo n't be enough . european commission president jose manuel barroso announced the emergency farm aid package on monday , july 7 .
barroso is in japan for this week 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit where the leaders of the world 's wealthiest nations are expected to discuss soaring food prices .
" the eu really can give a boost to agriculture in developing countries , " barroso said in announcing the aid package , which he said represented " a strong and rapid agricultural supply response . "
the money would come from unused european farm subsidies and would be mainly directed at africa .
it would bring the total agricultural aid provided by europe to poor countries in 2008 and 2009 to 1.8 billion euros .
" the commission has moved fast to respond to the food price crisis and its impact in particular on developing countries , " barroso said .

at least half of this extra money should go to africa , they said at the time .
" we have to show that we are ready to deliver on our commitments , " barroso said , noting that europe had provided 60 percent of worldwide development aid in 2007 .
" there is no going back . " seen as a " positive step " the eu has been criticized for the 40 billion euros in subsidies paid to european farmers .
these subsidies damage poor countries ' agricultural competitiveness , critics say .
" a lot of things about europe 's agricultural policies are not great for africa , but this is a really positive step , " oliver buston , a spokesman for the anti-poverty one campaign , told reuters news agency .

discussions on the missile shield have been dragging on since may 2007 .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .
lingering anger over eu treaty comments gusenbauer and faymann enraged their junior coalition partner when they announced their intention to hold popular votes on future eu treaties in a letter to austria 's biggest newspaper in late june without informing the conservatives .
molterer said that the social democrats had left the common ground of the coalition agreement and called for a " european perspective for our country . "
the green party and the right-wing freedom party have announced they would support the conservatives in a parliamentary decision on early elections , thus guaranteeing a majority .

the pilots want better pay , and the passengers are feeling the crunch . german pilots on a 24 hour strike have forced the cancellation of more than 600 cityline and eurowings flights on monday .
thousands of passengers were given the option of finding other flights or using the german rail system .
lufthansa , which owns the two airlines , is not releasing the exact number of passengers affected , though the biggest impact was at the major german airports in frankfurt , munich and düsseldorf . the pilots ' union cockpit called some 1,000 pilots at cityline and eurowings out on a 24-hour strike that was to end at midnight monday .
the union maintains that the companies have not presented an offer worthy of negotiations in the current round of pay talks . the head of tariff policies at cockpit , ilona ritter , told ap that the pilots ’ union was waiting for “ the airlines to move on their demands and come up with an offer . ” lufthansa spokesman thomas jachnow said that an offer has been on the table for the past four weeks . more strikes in the works lufthansa was also holding negotiations with the labor union ver.di concerning some 60,000 ground and cabin crew members .
however , these talks fell apart last week with no resolution to the problem .
ver.di has given lufthansa a deadline of wednesday to come up with an offer .
in the event that an agreement can ’ t be made by then , the labor union will vote on whether or not they should strike . call before you fly lufthansa is expressing regret over the strike , urging passengers to call before heading to the airport and , if possible , to drive or take the train .
lufthansa spokeswoman renate hocke says the airline finds it “ very unfortunate that passengers are bearing the brunt of this . ” cityline is a subsidiary of lufthansa , which also holds a 49 percent stake eurowings .
together the two airlines transport some 18 million passengers a year all across europe .

this represented an increase of 8 percent since december 2007 . moreover , with merkel and her supporters opposed to winding back nuclear power , the question has sparked fresh tensions in her coalition with the spd and raised the prospect of atomic energy emerging as a key issue at next year national german election . speaking ahead of her trip to japan for the g8 summit , merkel lashed out at the decision to end nuclear power in germany , saying it was " absolutely wrong . "
she repeated her call for a mix of energy sources for europe 's biggest economy including fossil fuels and renewable power as well nuclear plans . g8 climate goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big climate decisions are not likely to come out of this summit the last g8 summit in germany agreed that industrial powers would " consider seriously " at least halving carbon emissions blamed for global warming by 2050 .
but critics say that the agreement is meaningless without binding targets for what to do in the mid-term to 2020 . european commission chief jose manuel barroso voiced hope that the summit in the mountain resort of toyako would at least agree on the principle of each g8 nation setting its own mid-term target . " serious consideration is not enough ; we need a decision , " barroso told reporters .
" it is not likely that during this summit we will achieve a concrete numerical target for a mid-term agreement , " he said . but " if we come with a long-term commitment of a 50 percent reduction by 2050 and a principle agreement on mid-term reduction , we can speak of success , " he said . a pro-nuclear g8 on sunday , barroso joined the debate in germany on the future of nuclear power , telling the bild am sonntag newspaper that atomic energy could help to ease the current energy crisis . a g8 communiqué stressing the importance of nuclear power in the battle to combat climate change could initially cause germany a measure of political discomfort .
but it could also have the effect of bolstering the chancellor 's case for jettisoning germany 's current anti-nuclear law . the us , backed by six other g8 members , has pointed to the building of more nuclear power plants as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions . briefing the press on the sidelines of the g8 , us president george w. bush 's environment advisor , jim connaughton , stressed the " green " properties of nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power france developed nuclear energy to reduce foreign energy dependence after the oil shock of the 1970s .
it now receives nearly 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power and is a net exporter of electricity .
the country has been constructing its first european pressurized reactor , or epr , on the normandy coast .
it is expected to go into service in 2012 . nuclear power provides 30 percent of japan 's electricity .
the country is working to increase this to 37 percent by 2009 and 41 percent by 2017 . britain , canada , italy , russia are all broadly in favor of atomic power . an eu survey published last thursday found that some 44 percent of europeans are either " totally in favor " or " fairly in favor " of nuclear energy , according to the survey , carried out in february and march . the last time the survey was carried out in 2005 the figure was 37 percent . nuclear campaign chancellor merkel 's supporters have launched a campaign to reverse germany 's push to shut down its nuclear reactors , also declaring " atomic energy is an ecological energy . " nuclear supporters have also begun to argue that germany could fail to meet future commitments to cut the co2 emissions that cause global warming unless it reverses the phasing out law and extends the life of nuclear reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's spd wants to put the focus on renewables , not nuclear but merkel 's environment minister sigmar gabriel , an spd member , has hit back , insisting that " the risks of this technology could not be played down . "
instead , the spd has sought to underscore the importance of pushing ahead with developing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power . with this mind , infrastructure minister wolfgang tiefensee , also a spd member , has announced a dramatic expansion of wind energy , including the building of wind parks in the sea . " we are emphasizing renewal energy and not atomic energy , " tiefensee told germany 's weekly welt am sonntag , adding that the aim was to make the nation independent of foreign sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to sources within the social democratic party , gusenbauer told the party leadership on monday that he would not run for chancellor in the upcoming vote .
he proposed current party leader and transport minister werner faymann as the new top candidate , austrian media reported .
vice chancellor wilhelm molterer , the leader of the people 's party , said the social democrats ' current leadership crisis had led the cabinet into a " dead end " and elections by september were the only way out .
gusenbauer unpopular indirectly , he also alluded to his party 's anger over a recent change in eu policy by gusenbauer .
in mid-june , gusenbauer effectively stepped down as head of the social democratic party amid low approval ratings .
he appointed werner faymann as interim party chief until his formal election in autumn .
" the austrian social democratic party is without leadership and is not able to take on a leadership role in federal government , " molterer said .
lingering anger over eu treaty comments gusenbauer and faymann enraged their junior coalition partner when they announced their intention to hold popular votes on future eu treaties in a letter to austria 's biggest newspaper in late june without informing the conservatives .
molterer said that the social democrats had left the common ground of the coalition agreement and called for a " european perspective for our country . "
the green party and the right-wing freedom party have announced they would support the conservatives in a parliamentary decision on early elections , thus guaranteeing a majority .

in the exclusive interview with the bbc , mr kant told midlands transport correspondent peter plisner that his company would continue to invest in new models .
he said : " whatever would be required for the upliftment of these plans for the sustained profitability of the plan we will be doing it because it 's a company owned by us . "
following much speculation about a modern revival of the old iconic e-type jaguar , mr kant refused to talk about the exact nature of planned future models , but did not rule out the prospect of a new e-type .
he said : " we have taken a lot of feedback and from people who are knowledgeable about this .
" we are putting it all together and we will try to work out things that will be in the best interests of the company . "
when it bought the two brands from ford , tata pledged to leave the existing management and workforce in place and signed up to the companies ' existing business plans .
luxury brands mr kant said : " if the economy assumptions are not as per the plan , if the price assumptions are not as per the plan or the cost assumptions do not come out as per the plan then the plans will have to be looked at . "
expressing confidence it can return jaguar to profit , tata cited its experience in korea where it now owns the truck firm daewoo .
mr kant made it clear it would be following the same principles .
he also maintained his company would own the jaguar and land rover brands for a long time .
kant said : " we are there for the long haul .
we are not some people who have come here for two quarters or three quarters .
" we understand the automobile business and we are going to be there for good . "
the two companies have sites at solihull and castle bromwich , near birmingham , whitley in coventry , gaydon in warwickshire and halewood on merseyside .
they were being sold for £ 1.15bn with ford paying £ 600m into the pension fund of the luxury brands .

there is plenty of traffic on the roads in mumbai you notice it even before you leave the airport car park and we were told the journey to the hotel would take about an hour despite the fact it was close to midnight and only a 15-mile -lrb- 24.14km -rrb- journey .
during the day journey times get even longer .
and we thought congestion in the midlands was bad .
new dealership i had gone to india to investigate the motoring giant tata , which recently bought jaguar and land rover from ford .
mumbai 's rich are buying more and more expensive cars while young children beg on the street and people sleep rough .
two years ago rolls royce returned to mumbai .
a new dealership brought the uk brand back to the city for the first time in half a century .
for those who can not afford cars there are plenty of other forms of transport , including taxis .
rolls royce has returned to mumbai mumbai seems to have more of them than any other city i have been to and they are also incredibly cheap .
jaguars are not yet sold in india , although that might change now that tata has taken over the brand .
we talked to one person who already owns a jag .
bollywood star jackie schroff has one of the earliest jaguars made .
another thing i noticed early on was the amount of business tata is involved in .
best seller one analyst told me that when he wakes up he uses tata products and when he goes to bed it is tata .
the company is into everything and the signs around mumbai are everywhere .
from buses , lorries and cars to water , crisps and tea it is all made by tata .
motorbikes are also popular in india , but you will be surprised when you see that not all riders wear helmets .
even if they do it is usually only the driver .
a loophole in the law appears to let them off the hook , although not when it comes to safety in an accident .
motorbikes are popular with people in india after a few days in mumbai we moved to pune along what can only be described as the bumpiest motorway i have ever travelled on .
pune is where tata has one of its biggest car plants .
more than 1,000 vehicles a day emerge from the factory .
it is also the place where much of the development work has been done on the nano , the world 's cheapest car .
it was unveiled in january and the world 's press loved it .
as one of the first uk journalists to be given access to the car i felt honoured .
sitting in the car , although it is small , it feels incredibly spacious .
technology centre elsewhere in the plant workers were busy making tata 's most popular model , the indica .
it is a best seller for them , although when the same car was rebranded , the city rover here did not sell so well .
some might remember top gear presenter james may saying it was the worst car he had ever driven .
tata admits they learnt important lessons from its dealings with mg rover .
but despite the collapse of mg rover , a british connection with tata remains .
it is employing scores of engineers from the uk to help improve the quality of the india product .
the company has also set up a technology centre in coventry .
while in pune i met up with dr clive hickman , tata 's head of engineering .
he talks enthusiastically about both tata and the cars they are producing and seems confident that if tata 's cars are launched again in the uk , the reception will be very different from what greeted the city rover .
a new version of the indica is due to be launched in india very soon .

there is plenty of traffic on the roads in mumbai you notice it even before you leave the airport car park and we were told the journey to the hotel would take about an hour despite the fact it was close to midnight and only a 15-mile -lrb- 24.14km -rrb- journey .
during the day journey times get even longer .
and we thought congestion in the midlands was bad .
new dealership i had gone to india to investigate the motoring giant tata , which recently bought jaguar and land rover from ford .
mumbai 's rich are buying more and more expensive cars while young children beg on the street and people sleep rough .
two years ago rolls royce returned to mumbai .
a new dealership brought the uk brand back to the city for the first time in half a century .
for those who can not afford cars there are plenty of other forms of transport , including taxis .
rolls royce has returned to mumbai mumbai seems to have more of them than any other city i have been to and they are also incredibly cheap .
jaguars are not yet sold in india , although that might change now that tata has taken over the brand .
we talked to one person who already owns a jag .
bollywood star jackie schroff has one of the earliest jaguars made .
another thing i noticed early on was the amount of business tata is involved in .
best seller one analyst told me that when he wakes up he uses tata products and when he goes to bed it is tata .
the company is into everything and the signs around mumbai are everywhere .
from buses , lorries and cars to water , crisps and tea it is all made by tata .
motorbikes are also popular in india , but you will be surprised when you see that not all riders wear helmets .
even if they do it is usually only the driver .
a loophole in the law appears to let them off the hook , although not when it comes to safety in an accident .
motorbikes are popular with people in india after a few days in mumbai we moved to pune along what can only be described as the bumpiest motorway i have ever travelled on .
pune is where tata has one of its biggest car plants .
more than 1,000 vehicles a day emerge from the factory .
it is also the place where much of the development work has been done on the nano , the world 's cheapest car .
it was unveiled in january and the world 's press loved it .
as one of the first uk journalists to be given access to the car i felt honoured .
sitting in the car , although it is small , it feels incredibly spacious .
technology centre elsewhere in the plant workers were busy making tata 's most popular model , the indica .
it is a best seller for them , although when the same car was rebranded , the city rover here did not sell so well .
some might remember top gear presenter james may saying it was the worst car he had ever driven .
tata admits they learnt important lessons from its dealings with mg rover .
but despite the collapse of mg rover , a british connection with tata remains .
it is employing scores of engineers from the uk to help improve the quality of the india product .
the company has also set up a technology centre in coventry .
while in pune i met up with dr clive hickman , tata 's head of engineering .
he talks enthusiastically about both tata and the cars they are producing and seems confident that if tata 's cars are launched again in the uk , the reception will be very different from what greeted the city rover .
a new version of the indica is due to be launched in india very soon .

" stop wasting so much food , " is the headline in the daily mail , describing what it says are the prime minister 's household management tips .
the guardian says saving food will become as important as saving energy .
meanwhile , the independent claims supermarkets will be told to drop " three for two " deals on food .
' no way back ' the daily telegraph reports that some labour mps are saying there would be " no way back " for gordon brown if labour loses this month 's glasgow east by-election .
one of the government 's safest seats has turned into a possible disaster area , the paper continues .
according to the independent , a senior government member warns of moves to replace mr brown in september if labour remains in the opinion poll doldrums .
the times talks of a " disastrous " start to labour 's glasgow campaign .
holidays on hold a growing number of executives in britain are scrapping their summer holidays , the guardian reports .
a survey by the chartered management institute shows one in four are not using their full entitlement as the credit crunch takes its toll .
it seems that fears of redundancy , financial constraints and work overload are the main reasons .
it found 23 % were using holiday time to develop skills designed to make them " recession-proof " .
day of champions images of rafael nadal 's triumph at wimbledon and lewis hamilton 's victory in the british grand prix compete for space on the front pages .
it was , the daily express says , a day of sporting drama that gripped millions .
in the sun , hamilton 's formula one triumph and laura robson 's girl 's singles win at wimbledon " lifted the gloom of the credit crunch " .
" rafa is king of the courts , " declares the daily mirror , hailing what it calls the greatest wimbledon final .

council strikes on 16 and 17 july mean the grand brangwyn hall is out of bounds and instead ceremonies will be on a lawn near the campus entrance .
students have set up a protest group on social networking site facebook .
the university regretted the situation but reassured students that marquees were often used successfully elsewhere .
it comes after discussions were held with the council and union unison to try to ensure the hall was exempt from strike action over pay .
a spokesman for swansea council said the union initially rejected this option but eventually agreed to an exemption on friday afternoon .
i 'm not happy and wondering if it 's worth bothering when it 's clearly going to be a disaster dafydd vaughan hoped to graduate at brangwyn hall , like his parents by this stage it was too late for the university to rearrange its plans to use the marquee for 12 ceremonies from 14 to 18 july , he said .
angry students set up their facebook protest when they heard about the plans in letters on friday , and by sunday , it had more than 240 members .
computer science student dafydd vaughan , 21 , from abergavenny , said he was hoping to follow in the footsteps of his parents , bob and sue vaughan , who both graduated at brangwyn hall .
' building site ' " i 'm livid .
the campus is currently a building site , " he said .
" i was looking forward to my graduation and have already ordered my gown and photographs .
" i 'm not happy and wondering if it 's worth bothering when it 's clearly going to be a disaster . "
he said there other venues not under council control which would be more appropriate on campus such as the taliesin theatre , which is on campus .
dafydd 's father bob said : " as a graduate of swansea university myself i am outraged that my son will not have the opportunity to celebrate his achievements over the last four years in a fitting way . "
students on the facebook group are also worried about the fact the marquee will be erected on fulton green - which they claim is a " roundabout " at the university 's entrance .
brangwyn hall is usually used for swansea 's graduation ceremonies but the university has reassured them that traffic will be banned in the area for the graduation week .
they are also concerned that some guests who are unable to fit into the marquee will have to watch the proceedings via a video link to a nearby lecture theatre .
but the university says the marquee should be able to hold more guests than can normally be accommodated in brangwyn hall .
only guests invited in addition to the allocated two guests per student should have to use the lecture theatre , it said in a statement .
professor richard b davies , vice-chancellor of swansea university , said : " this is not the first time the graduation ceremonies have been held at the university campus , or the first time high-profile events or gatherings have taken place on fulton green .
" the university is doing everything in its power to ensure an enjoyable and memorable occasion for all graduating students this year . "
a swansea council spokesman said : " it is disappointing that these events at the brangwyn hall were cancelled owing to unison 's industrial action . "

here , we examine plaid 's response and on subsequent days , labour and the opposition .
on 6 july , 2007 , labour party members said yes to a coalition at a special conference in cardiff - a clear yes , but undoubtedly an if-we-really-have-to kind of yes .
the day after , plaid members flocked to pontrhydfendigaid to shout yes from the rooftops .
on the gate of the conference hall , party officers quickly removed a home-made placard , condemning plaid for keeping labour in government - the party they 'd based their whole campaign on pledging to kick into touch .
the 95 % plus who said yes to the deal before heading for home would hardly have noticed and twelve months later plaid seem to be openly voicing plans to kick labour into touch at the next election , thanks to the ballot boxes and this time , leading a government .
what would those ordinary plaid members have wanted out of the deal ?
a chance at being in government for the first time ever and a stable one at that ?
yes , of course .
wish list a referendum on or before 2011 ?
undoubtedly .
an updated welsh language act ?
yes and a welsh language daily newspaper as promised in the deal with labour along with the establishment of a properly funded , properly managed federal college .
today the plaid leadership sends them its message : you may not be able to put a tick next to anything on that wish list yet - in fact you can put a cross next to the idea of a daily newspaper - but in government plaid has " created a new welsh agenda " , one that 's put plaid cymru 's aspirations " at the forefront of the political agenda " .
in other words , we may not have delivered on that wish list but stick with us .
most of their supporters have and will .
with government - thanks to labour , though you 'd be had pressed to know that if you read plaid 's assessment of this first year - comes credibility and all in all plaid 's year has been a pretty good one .
concerns ministers have hit the mark mostly - even if culture minister rhodri glyn thomas missed it spectacularly last week when he somewhat inexplicably named the wrong winner of the wales book of the year .
the local election results were much better than last time round .
but some are worried that plaid is forgetting its grassroots .
you only need to look at the kicking plaid took in gwynedd on 1 may and the lack of support locally for its parliamentary candidate in ceredigion to know that .
their concerns ?
that plaid is enjoying being in government but forgetting who put them there , treading too lightly on the path towards delivering the constitutional reform that would have compelled most supporters to vote yes twelve months ago .
they may look forward to the imminent election of party president as an opportunity to air their views .

here , we examine plaid 's response and on subsequent days , labour and the opposition .
on 6 july , 2007 , labour party members said yes to a coalition at a special conference in cardiff - a clear yes , but undoubtedly an if-we-really-have-to kind of yes .
the day after , plaid members flocked to pontrhydfendigaid to shout yes from the rooftops .
on the gate of the conference hall , party officers quickly removed a home-made placard , condemning plaid for keeping labour in government - the party they 'd based their whole campaign on pledging to kick into touch .
the 95 % plus who said yes to the deal before heading for home would hardly have noticed and twelve months later plaid seem to be openly voicing plans to kick labour into touch at the next election , thanks to the ballot boxes and this time , leading a government .
what would those ordinary plaid members have wanted out of the deal ?
a chance at being in government for the first time ever and a stable one at that ?
yes , of course .
wish list a referendum on or before 2011 ?
undoubtedly .
an updated welsh language act ?
yes and a welsh language daily newspaper as promised in the deal with labour along with the establishment of a properly funded , properly managed federal college .
today the plaid leadership sends them its message : you may not be able to put a tick next to anything on that wish list yet - in fact you can put a cross next to the idea of a daily newspaper - but in government plaid has " created a new welsh agenda " , one that 's put plaid cymru 's aspirations " at the forefront of the political agenda " .
in other words , we may not have delivered on that wish list but stick with us .
most of their supporters have and will .
with government - thanks to labour , though you 'd be had pressed to know that if you read plaid 's assessment of this first year - comes credibility and all in all plaid 's year has been a pretty good one .
concerns ministers have hit the mark mostly - even if culture minister rhodri glyn thomas missed it spectacularly last week when he somewhat inexplicably named the wrong winner of the wales book of the year .
the local election results were much better than last time round .
but some are worried that plaid is forgetting its grassroots .
you only need to look at the kicking plaid took in gwynedd on 1 may and the lack of support locally for its parliamentary candidate in ceredigion to know that .
their concerns ?
that plaid is enjoying being in government but forgetting who put them there , treading too lightly on the path towards delivering the constitutional reform that would have compelled most supporters to vote yes twelve months ago .
they may look forward to the imminent election of party president as an opportunity to air their views .
what next ?
walking the tightrope that lets plaid work with labour in torfaen and a couple of other councils , work with the conservatives in anyone-but-labour coalitions in rather more county halls and claim credit for policies pursued in cardiff bay that keep the grassroots happy .
