eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .
" this is not the kenya that we know . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odinga told steinmeier he was willing to negotiate violence broke out in the eastern african country following the disputed re-election of kenya 's president mwai kibaki on dec .

3 , by germany 's car industry association , the vda , vda statistics also showed that about 243,000 new cars hit german roads in december , about 20 percent fewer than in the same period one year ago .
however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.01.2008 european car markets hit by fuel tax , global insecurity in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automobile choices are increasing , but fewer europeans chose to buy in 2007 new eu regulations on car pollution , domestic fuel tax hikes , escalating oil prices and global financial insecurity have all contributed in making 2007 an annus horribilis for the european car industry . soaring energy prices and an unpopular tax hikes were blamed as car sales in germany slumped to a 17-year low in 2007 . german car sales dropped by 9 percent last year to 3.15 million , reaching the lowest level since the country was unified after the fall of the berlin wall over 17 years ago , according to figures released thursday , jan .
3 , by germany 's car industry association , the vda , vda statistics also showed that about 243,000 new cars hit german roads in december , about 20 percent fewer than in the same period one year ago .
however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .

for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .

after ex-terrorists gave news interviews last year hinting that one of the masked gunmen was never brought to justice , federal prosecutors reopened the inquiry , but the leftists refused to answer questions though prosecutors said they had no right to withhold information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar 's petition for clemency was denied by the german president last year mohnhaupt , folkerts and a former raf leader who is still in jail , christian klar , would be imprisoned for contempt if the arrest order is upheld .
german law provides for up to six months custody to force people to cooperate with the law . the agony of 1977 , when assassinations and kidnappings by raf terrorists reached a peak , continues to transfix germany , with a substantial number of people from the same generation regarding the group 's members as flawed heroes . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , dreamed of making germany a communist state and believed it could provoke a revolution by its campaign of violence against business and political leaders . it later dissolved itself . buback was shot dead from a motorcycle by two masked attackers who never admitted their identities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .

foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.01.2008 reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants will have to decide on their citizenship soon reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner . for an estimated 3,300 young germans of immigrant backgrounds , the new year brings a tough choice - should they keep the citizenship of the country they were born in or that of their parents ' home country ?
these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .

"
a court agreed and said station was not obligated to air the ad . according to the law in 14 of germany 's 16 states , including hesse , all political parties have a right to airtime on public radio stations prior to elections .
broadcasters are permitted to issue a disclaimer saying that the spot 's contents are purely the responsibility of the party . frankfurt-based hessischer rundfunk said the ad contained provocative material .
the ad was scheduled to run on friday , jan .
4 , and called for the deportation of non-germans with " foreign cultures , " according to media reports .
the right-wing extremist party is known for promoting xenophobia and its legality has come into question in the german parliament . the npd had appealed to the state administrative court in frankfurt for an interim court order against the broadcaster , a court spokesman said on wednesday .
but the court denied the party 's claim on thursday , according to hessischer rundfunk . " the cause of freedom of expression and the parties ' freedom to campaign can not lead to public broadcasters being forced to spread campaign messages that contain racist or inhuman ideology , " said helmut reitze , the broadcaster 's director general . hesse 's foreigners ' advisory council -lrb- agah -rrb- also expressed its approval of the broadcaster 's decision .

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .

the right-wing extremist party is known for promoting xenophobia and its legality has come into question in the german parliament . the npd had appealed to the state administrative court in frankfurt for an interim court order against the broadcaster , a court spokesman said on wednesday .
but the court denied the party 's claim on thursday , according to hessischer rundfunk . " the cause of freedom of expression and the parties ' freedom to campaign can not lead to public broadcasters being forced to spread campaign messages that contain racist or inhuman ideology , " said helmut reitze , the broadcaster 's director general . hesse 's foreigners ' advisory council -lrb- agah -rrb- also expressed its approval of the broadcaster 's decision .

since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .
on average , they rated their happiness at 6.2 . germans in the west of the country appear to be happier than those in the east , according to the poll .
western inhabitants rate their happiness at an average of 7.5 points while eastern inhabitants rate it marginally less at 6.9 . the survey also shows that germans in their 30s are the happiest age group with a rating of 7.9 on the happy scale . so if you 're a 30-something , employed person with job security , living in the west of germany , you must be feeling pretty pleased with things right now . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.01.2008 reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants will have to decide on their citizenship soon reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner . for an estimated 3,300 young germans of immigrant backgrounds , the new year brings a tough choice - should they keep the citizenship of the country they were born in or that of their parents ' home country ?
these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .
" we 'll see if there 's a legal process that then changes things . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .

however , he has told reporters that he is open to international mediation and proposed setting up a temporary power-sharing government until a second election could be held . lambsdorff said that the recent violence would likely damage kenya 's reputation as a democratic country . presidential victor still unclear paul east , deputy head of the commonwealth election observer group , said that it 's not possible to establish an election winner at this time , according to the associated press . he demanded that the election results be reevaluated by an independent judge , as did ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in germany 's parliament . speaking thursday morning on germany 's zdf television channel , polenz said the west 's influence on kenya was minimal .

"
a court agreed and said station was not obligated to air the ad . according to the law in 14 of germany 's 16 states , including hesse , all political parties have a right to airtime on public radio stations prior to elections .
broadcasters are permitted to issue a disclaimer saying that the spot 's contents are purely the responsibility of the party . frankfurt-based hessischer rundfunk said the ad contained provocative material .
the ad was scheduled to run on friday , jan .
4 , and called for the deportation of non-germans with " foreign cultures , " according to media reports .
the right-wing extremist party is known for promoting xenophobia and its legality has come into question in the german parliament . the npd had appealed to the state administrative court in frankfurt for an interim court order against the broadcaster , a court spokesman said on wednesday .
but the court denied the party 's claim on thursday , according to hessischer rundfunk . " the cause of freedom of expression and the parties ' freedom to campaign can not lead to public broadcasters being forced to spread campaign messages that contain racist or inhuman ideology , " said helmut reitze , the broadcaster 's director general . hesse 's foreigners ' advisory council -lrb- agah -rrb- also expressed its approval of the broadcaster 's decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.01.2008 reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants will have to decide on their citizenship soon reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner . for an estimated 3,300 young germans of immigrant backgrounds , the new year brings a tough choice - should they keep the citizenship of the country they were born in or that of their parents ' home country ?
these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .
" we 'll see if there 's a legal process that then changes things . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.01.2008 reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants will have to decide on their citizenship soon reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner . for an estimated 3,300 young germans of immigrant backgrounds , the new year brings a tough choice - should they keep the citizenship of the country they were born in or that of their parents ' home country ?
these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .
" this is not the kenya that we know . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odinga told steinmeier he was willing to negotiate violence broke out in the eastern african country following the disputed re-election of kenya 's president mwai kibaki on dec .

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .
" this is not the kenya that we know . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odinga told steinmeier he was willing to negotiate violence broke out in the eastern african country following the disputed re-election of kenya 's president mwai kibaki on dec .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .

rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .
" we 'll see if there 's a legal process that then changes things . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue conservative politicians in the state of hesse are latching on to the issue of how to deal with crime committed by young foreigners to score points with voters in a key regional election later this month .
-lrb- 02.01.2008 -rrb- germany allows more people to hold dual citizenship germany is allowing more people to hold dual citizenship thanks to changes in its immigration law .
the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality .

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .
" this is not the kenya that we know . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odinga told steinmeier he was willing to negotiate violence broke out in the eastern african country following the disputed re-election of kenya 's president mwai kibaki on dec .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice also appealed to the opposition leader for a peaceful resolution . " in a free society , everyone has the right to demonstrate , " alexander graf lambsdorff , head of the eu 's election monitoring team for the kenya polls , told deutsche welle .
" however , both the opposition and the government are called on to prevent further violence . " democracy is at stake lambsdorff said that , while europe and the us should assist kenya , " only the kenyans themselves can decide their country 's future . "
kibaki and odinga have to move away from their extreme positions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 340 people have been killed and 100,000 have been pushed out of their homes odinga sees himself as the rightful victor in last week 's presidential elections and has accused kibaki of fixing the results . in an interview with the bbc , he called thursday 's protest march " the beginning of a long process " to secure democracy in the country .
however , he has told reporters that he is open to international mediation and proposed setting up a temporary power-sharing government until a second election could be held . lambsdorff said that the recent violence would likely damage kenya 's reputation as a democratic country . presidential victor still unclear paul east , deputy head of the commonwealth election observer group , said that it 's not possible to establish an election winner at this time , according to the associated press . he demanded that the election results be reevaluated by an independent judge , as did ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in germany 's parliament . speaking thursday morning on germany 's zdf television channel , polenz said the west 's influence on kenya was minimal .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .

however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .

" " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .

3 , by germany 's car industry association , the vda , vda statistics also showed that about 243,000 new cars hit german roads in december , about 20 percent fewer than in the same period one year ago .
however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .

these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .
on average , they rated their happiness at 6.2 . germans in the west of the country appear to be happier than those in the east , according to the poll .
western inhabitants rate their happiness at an average of 7.5 points while eastern inhabitants rate it marginally less at 6.9 . the survey also shows that germans in their 30s are the happiest age group with a rating of 7.9 on the happy scale . so if you 're a 30-something , employed person with job security , living in the west of germany , you must be feeling pretty pleased with things right now . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .
" this is not the kenya that we know . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odinga told steinmeier he was willing to negotiate violence broke out in the eastern african country following the disputed re-election of kenya 's president mwai kibaki on dec .
27 .
since then , some 340 people have been killed in the unrest and the kenyan red cross estimates that 100,000 people have become refugees . germany , us call for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier asked odinga in a telephone conversation on wednesday to " avoid provocation and violence . "
he talked with kenyan foreign minister raphael tuju as well , insisting that the police adopt a policy of de-escalation . according to the german foreign ministry , odinga agreed to encourage peaceful behavior among his followers .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also appealed to the opposition leader for a peaceful resolution . " in a free society , everyone has the right to demonstrate , " alexander graf lambsdorff , head of the eu 's election monitoring team for the kenya polls , told deutsche welle .
" however , both the opposition and the government are called on to prevent further violence . " democracy is at stake lambsdorff said that , while europe and the us should assist kenya , " only the kenyans themselves can decide their country 's future . "
kibaki and odinga have to move away from their extreme positions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 340 people have been killed and 100,000 have been pushed out of their homes odinga sees himself as the rightful victor in last week 's presidential elections and has accused kibaki of fixing the results . in an interview with the bbc , he called thursday 's protest march " the beginning of a long process " to secure democracy in the country .
however , he has told reporters that he is open to international mediation and proposed setting up a temporary power-sharing government until a second election could be held . lambsdorff said that the recent violence would likely damage kenya 's reputation as a democratic country . presidential victor still unclear paul east , deputy head of the commonwealth election observer group , said that it 's not possible to establish an election winner at this time , according to the associated press . he demanded that the election results be reevaluated by an independent judge , as did ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in germany 's parliament . speaking thursday morning on germany 's zdf television channel , polenz said the west 's influence on kenya was minimal .
he called on china , which has close economic ties to the african country , to send a " clear message " to the kenyan government . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .

the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .

3 , by germany 's car industry association , the vda , vda statistics also showed that about 243,000 new cars hit german roads in december , about 20 percent fewer than in the same period one year ago .
however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .
on average , they rated their happiness at 6.2 . germans in the west of the country appear to be happier than those in the east , according to the poll .
western inhabitants rate their happiness at an average of 7.5 points while eastern inhabitants rate it marginally less at 6.9 . the survey also shows that germans in their 30s are the happiest age group with a rating of 7.9 on the happy scale . so if you 're a 30-something , employed person with job security , living in the west of germany , you must be feeling pretty pleased with things right now . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 03.01.2008 european car markets hit by fuel tax , global insecurity in 2007 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automobile choices are increasing , but fewer europeans chose to buy in 2007 new eu regulations on car pollution , domestic fuel tax hikes , escalating oil prices and global financial insecurity have all contributed in making 2007 an annus horribilis for the european car industry . soaring energy prices and an unpopular tax hikes were blamed as car sales in germany slumped to a 17-year low in 2007 . german car sales dropped by 9 percent last year to 3.15 million , reaching the lowest level since the country was unified after the fall of the berlin wall over 17 years ago , according to figures released thursday , jan .
3 , by germany 's car industry association , the vda , vda statistics also showed that about 243,000 new cars hit german roads in december , about 20 percent fewer than in the same period one year ago .
however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.01.2008 reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants will have to decide on their citizenship soon reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner . for an estimated 3,300 young germans of immigrant backgrounds , the new year brings a tough choice - should they keep the citizenship of the country they were born in or that of their parents ' home country ?
these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .

"
he talked with kenyan foreign minister raphael tuju as well , insisting that the police adopt a policy of de-escalation . according to the german foreign ministry , odinga agreed to encourage peaceful behavior among his followers .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also appealed to the opposition leader for a peaceful resolution . " in a free society , everyone has the right to demonstrate , " alexander graf lambsdorff , head of the eu 's election monitoring team for the kenya polls , told deutsche welle .
" however , both the opposition and the government are called on to prevent further violence . " democracy is at stake lambsdorff said that , while europe and the us should assist kenya , " only the kenyans themselves can decide their country 's future . "
kibaki and odinga have to move away from their extreme positions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 340 people have been killed and 100,000 have been pushed out of their homes odinga sees himself as the rightful victor in last week 's presidential elections and has accused kibaki of fixing the results . in an interview with the bbc , he called thursday 's protest march " the beginning of a long process " to secure democracy in the country .
however , he has told reporters that he is open to international mediation and proposed setting up a temporary power-sharing government until a second election could be held . lambsdorff said that the recent violence would likely damage kenya 's reputation as a democratic country . presidential victor still unclear paul east , deputy head of the commonwealth election observer group , said that it 's not possible to establish an election winner at this time , according to the associated press . he demanded that the election results be reevaluated by an independent judge , as did ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in germany 's parliament . speaking thursday morning on germany 's zdf television channel , polenz said the west 's influence on kenya was minimal .
he called on china , which has close economic ties to the african country , to send a " clear message " to the kenyan government . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a court agreed and said station was not obligated to air the ad . according to the law in 14 of germany 's 16 states , including hesse , all political parties have a right to airtime on public radio stations prior to elections .
broadcasters are permitted to issue a disclaimer saying that the spot 's contents are purely the responsibility of the party . frankfurt-based hessischer rundfunk said the ad contained provocative material .
the ad was scheduled to run on friday , jan .
4 , and called for the deportation of non-germans with " foreign cultures , " according to media reports .
the right-wing extremist party is known for promoting xenophobia and its legality has come into question in the german parliament . the npd had appealed to the state administrative court in frankfurt for an interim court order against the broadcaster , a court spokesman said on wednesday .
but the court denied the party 's claim on thursday , according to hessischer rundfunk . " the cause of freedom of expression and the parties ' freedom to campaign can not lead to public broadcasters being forced to spread campaign messages that contain racist or inhuman ideology , " said helmut reitze , the broadcaster 's director general . hesse 's foreigners ' advisory council -lrb- agah -rrb- also expressed its approval of the broadcaster 's decision . " democracy and the principle of equal chances in the elections do n't mean that inhuman and racist ideas should be spread on public radio , " agah head yilmaz memisoglu said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all !

despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .

after ex-terrorists gave news interviews last year hinting that one of the masked gunmen was never brought to justice , federal prosecutors reopened the inquiry , but the leftists refused to answer questions though prosecutors said they had no right to withhold information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar 's petition for clemency was denied by the german president last year mohnhaupt , folkerts and a former raf leader who is still in jail , christian klar , would be imprisoned for contempt if the arrest order is upheld .
german law provides for up to six months custody to force people to cooperate with the law . the agony of 1977 , when assassinations and kidnappings by raf terrorists reached a peak , continues to transfix germany , with a substantial number of people from the same generation regarding the group 's members as flawed heroes . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , dreamed of making germany a communist state and believed it could provoke a revolution by its campaign of violence against business and political leaders . it later dissolved itself . buback was shot dead from a motorcycle by two masked attackers who never admitted their identities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .
on average , they rated their happiness at 6.2 . germans in the west of the country appear to be happier than those in the east , according to the poll .
western inhabitants rate their happiness at an average of 7.5 points while eastern inhabitants rate it marginally less at 6.9 . the survey also shows that germans in their 30s are the happiest age group with a rating of 7.9 on the happy scale . so if you 're a 30-something , employed person with job security , living in the west of germany , you must be feeling pretty pleased with things right now . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .
on average , they rated their happiness at 6.2 . germans in the west of the country appear to be happier than those in the east , according to the poll .
western inhabitants rate their happiness at an average of 7.5 points while eastern inhabitants rate it marginally less at 6.9 . the survey also shows that germans in their 30s are the happiest age group with a rating of 7.9 on the happy scale . so if you 're a 30-something , employed person with job security , living in the west of germany , you must be feeling pretty pleased with things right now . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .
3 .
after ex-terrorists gave news interviews last year hinting that one of the masked gunmen was never brought to justice , federal prosecutors reopened the inquiry , but the leftists refused to answer questions though prosecutors said they had no right to withhold information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar 's petition for clemency was denied by the german president last year mohnhaupt , folkerts and a former raf leader who is still in jail , christian klar , would be imprisoned for contempt if the arrest order is upheld .
german law provides for up to six months custody to force people to cooperate with the law . the agony of 1977 , when assassinations and kidnappings by raf terrorists reached a peak , continues to transfix germany , with a substantial number of people from the same generation regarding the group 's members as flawed heroes . the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , dreamed of making germany a communist state and believed it could provoke a revolution by its campaign of violence against business and political leaders . it later dissolved itself . buback was shot dead from a motorcycle by two masked attackers who never admitted their identities . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .

" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .

he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .

these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .

3 , by germany 's car industry association , the vda , vda statistics also showed that about 243,000 new cars hit german roads in december , about 20 percent fewer than in the same period one year ago .
however , sales in december 2006 came on the back of a surge as car buyers attempted to avoid the increase in the value-added-tax -lrb- vat -rrb- which was introduced in january 2007 . in contrast , german car production climbed to its highest level ever , powered ahead by record car exports . last year was the fifth consecutive year that german exports have risen , increasing to hit a new record of 4.3 million passenger vehicles .
three of every four german produced cars are exported . german auto exports ended 2007 on a high note with car exports jumping 9 percent in december , the vda said .
foreign orders were up 7 percent . continuing uncertainty bodes ill for 2008 sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising fuel prices are likely to affect car sales in 2008 the hefty 3 percent increase in vat was blamed for 2007 's slump along with rising petrol prices driven by instability in the middle east , and the on-going debate about climate change . economists said they fear that worries about weakening consumer spending , oil at a record high and concerns that the us sub-prime mortgage crisis might spread and could continue to hit car sales in the coming year . but the vda said a rebound in sales in the last quarter of 2007 " leads us to hope for a slight improvement of the domestic market in 2008 . " " we expect a slight recovery in the car business during 2008 , " said vda president matthias wissmann said at the release of the figures on thursday . other european markets faired better in 2007 , but only on the back of the europe-wide trend of surge buying in the face of impending tax hikes . increases in france , holland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people rushed to buy suvs before tax hikes came in in france , the motor industry managed a tepid 3.2 percent rise in year-on-year sales , shifting 2.064 million units , boosted by a spike in december sales ahead of penalties on big cylinder cars .
penalties for car pollution , from 200 euros to 2,600 euros -lrb- $ 295 to $ 3,813 -rrb- per vehicle , came into force at the end of 2007 . the french market has been struggling for the past five years after booming sales of over 2.2 million cars a year between1999 and 2002 .
since 2003 , sales have been hovering just over the 2 million mark , while 2005 and 2006 both saw sales dip below 2 million . a similar boost in sales gave the dutch market a rosier complexion at the end of the year but again , this was due to a looming rise in tax on gas guzzlers .
sales in the netherlands rose by 4 percent to 504,197 cars , marginally exceeding the industry 's annual expectations of 500,000 . however , the dutch automotive industry has said it expects a 3.4 percent decline to 487,000 vehicles in 2008 . both france and the netherlands could well experience a similar dramatic slump in 2008 to that experienced in germany as the tax on fuel and certain vehicles starts to bite . environmental issues were quoted by the british smmt industry body for the 3.1 percent dip in the uk market until november last year . meanwhile , italy recorded a rise in sales , selling 2.49 million new cars , a year-on-year increase of 7 percent , according to figures published by the transport ministry . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.01.2008 reformed citizenship laws pose dilemma for young germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrants will have to decide on their citizenship soon reformed citizenship laws mean that , starting this year , young germans with immigrant backgrounds who have thus far had dual citizenship will have to choose between being a german or a foreigner . for an estimated 3,300 young germans of immigrant backgrounds , the new year brings a tough choice - should they keep the citizenship of the country they were born in or that of their parents ' home country ?
these are youth who turn 18 this year and made use of reformed citizenship laws in 2000 to become naturalized germans .
so far , they were allowed to have dual citizenship .
but this year , they can expect to receive a letter from authorities on their birthdays urging them to choose one or the other passport .
if they fail to do that , they automatically lose their german passports when they turn 23 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many naturalized germans , the forced choice could lead to a conflict of loyalites being forced to choose between nationalities could mean a conflict of identity and loyalties for these youth , said kenan kolat , chairman of the turkish community in germany .
turks make up the largest group of immigrants in germany , with an estimated 2.3 million of them resident in the country .
" most are n't really aware of the problem .
but that will change in the next months , " kolat told the daily frankfurter rundschau .
" the government could send a signal and win over these young people by doing away with the forced choice , " he said .
controversial compromise the seemingly bewildering situation dates back to a radical overhaul of citizenship laws in 2000 by the government of chancellor gerhard schröder .
the ruling coalition made up of the social democrats and greens liberalized germany 's restrictive citizenship laws , which had previously only recognized the principle of nationality by blood .
for instance , an ethnic german from kazakhstan who had never lived in germany could claim citizenship , but a turk born and raised in germany who spoke only german could not .
the reform now allows foreigners who have lived in germany for eight years to apply for naturalization .
but the original plan to allow their children born in germany to automatically become german failed in the face of fierce opposition by conservative parties who controlled the upper house of parliament .
as a compromise , it was decided that naturalized children would have to decide at the age of 18 whether they wanted to keep their german passport or their foreign one .
law outdated , say experts the law has sparked debate among german politicians and immigration experts , many of whom argue that the legislation is outdated and counterproductive .
" we have to soon consider whether what we decided eight years ago was n't completely wrong , " said dieter wiefelspütz , domestic policy expert of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , adding that it was time to scratch the law .
uwe berlitt , a federal judge , told the frankfurter rundschau that the citizenship law could run counter to ongoing efforts to better integrate foreigners and immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany defies a european trend towards dual citizenship those who have their german citizenship taken away will continue to live in germany , berlitt pointed out .
the difference would be that they would be treated as second-class citizens .
he urged politicians to have a pragmatic , non-ideological debate about dual citizenship .
rainer hofmann , a legal expert in frankfurt , pointed out that a long-running goal of german politics to prevent dual nationality wherever possible was outdated .
dual nationality is a " europe-wide trend , " hofmann said during a debate on the issue in parliament in december .
it corresponds to the situation of those affected " who often have strong emotional , personal , legal and social links to both countries . "
in august , the german interior ministry confirmed that people applying for german citizenship no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland .
few new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by those changes , since most do n't come from eu countries .
conservatives unlikely to scratch the law while some fear the citizenship law will prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare - an estimated 300,000 young germans of immigrant extraction are to be affected by it in the next few years - there seems little chance of a political majority emerging against it in the near future .
wolfgang bosbach , head of the parliamentary group of angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said he was in favor of going back to the pre-2000 german citizenship law based on blood .
meanwhile , another senior cdu politician currently stands accused of stirring up hostility against foreigners in a bid to win a crucial regional election .
roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , won the regional elections there in 1999 after launching a controversial signature campaign against the then planned dual-citizenship law .
for now , kolat of the turkish community recommended that those affected by the law bide their time and wait with their decision as long as possible .
" you should try to keep both the german and turkish passport , " kolat told the daily die tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- .
" we 'll see if there 's a legal process that then changes things . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu observers say last week 's elections results , which led to the unrest , should be reviewed . kenyan police used tear gas and water cannons on thursday as thousands of supporters of opposition leader raila odinga took to the streets in downtown nairobi , shouting " peace " and singing the national anthem .
despite a government ban , odinga had called for a peaceful rally in uhuru park , which would unofficially crown him " president of the people . " " kill us all ! " cried a group of demonstrators , kneeling before riot police who fired warning shots into the air . nobel peace prize laureate desmond tutu , in kenya as a mediator , said the country 's reputation as a model of stability had been shattered . " i do n't think there is anybody who would be unmoved by the pictures that are coming out - of people who burned to death in a church , " he said , referring to an ethnically motivated attack on 30 members of kibaki 's kikuyu tribe earlier this week .
" this is not the kenya that we know . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : odinga told steinmeier he was willing to negotiate violence broke out in the eastern african country following the disputed re-election of kenya 's president mwai kibaki on dec .

"
he talked with kenyan foreign minister raphael tuju as well , insisting that the police adopt a policy of de-escalation . according to the german foreign ministry , odinga agreed to encourage peaceful behavior among his followers .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice also appealed to the opposition leader for a peaceful resolution . " in a free society , everyone has the right to demonstrate , " alexander graf lambsdorff , head of the eu 's election monitoring team for the kenya polls , told deutsche welle .
" however , both the opposition and the government are called on to prevent further violence . " democracy is at stake lambsdorff said that , while europe and the us should assist kenya , " only the kenyans themselves can decide their country 's future . "
kibaki and odinga have to move away from their extreme positions , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 340 people have been killed and 100,000 have been pushed out of their homes odinga sees himself as the rightful victor in last week 's presidential elections and has accused kibaki of fixing the results . in an interview with the bbc , he called thursday 's protest march " the beginning of a long process " to secure democracy in the country .
however , he has told reporters that he is open to international mediation and proposed setting up a temporary power-sharing government until a second election could be held . lambsdorff said that the recent violence would likely damage kenya 's reputation as a democratic country . presidential victor still unclear paul east , deputy head of the commonwealth election observer group , said that it 's not possible to establish an election winner at this time , according to the associated press . he demanded that the election results be reevaluated by an independent judge , as did ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in germany 's parliament . speaking thursday morning on germany 's zdf television channel , polenz said the west 's influence on kenya was minimal .
he called on china , which has close economic ties to the african country , to send a " clear message " to the kenyan government . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can be the affirmation of others , the reaching of the pinnacle of success or the discovery of love .
but for germans , it seems that happiness is something else . a new survey conducted by the bertelsmann foundation shows that those germans who enjoy the benefits of so-called " jobs for life " - positions such as those in governmental , educational and institutional employment - are the happiest people in the country . the results are unsurprising .
these jobs offer security until retirement , impressive benefit packages and a contractual comfort zone which is impervious to scandal , laziness and the end of usefulness . imagine being in a job where you can sit undisturbed in your own office every day , underperforming and using up resources while still bringing home a tasty salary and accumulating a tidy retirement package , safe in the knowledge that only committing mass murder will result in you getting the sack .
would n't you be happy ? throw in the guilty pleasures gained from making other people 's jobs harder , slowing productivity to a crawl and firing off inane e-mails on the hour about random office observations and you 're looking at employment nirvana . secure employment gets a high happiness score bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employed , secure 30-somethings in western germany on the bertelsmann happiness rating system offered to those taking part in the poll , these lucky people rated their existence , on average , as a 7.9 on the scale where one was miserable as sin and ten was ecstatic . however , unemployed people in germany were not that far behind .
on average , they rated their happiness at 6.2 . germans in the west of the country appear to be happier than those in the east , according to the poll .
western inhabitants rate their happiness at an average of 7.5 points while eastern inhabitants rate it marginally less at 6.9 . the survey also shows that germans in their 30s are the happiest age group with a rating of 7.9 on the happy scale . so if you 're a 30-something , employed person with job security , living in the west of germany , you must be feeling pretty pleased with things right now . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they are n't likely to go back behind bars anytime soon . the judge called for the arrest of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leader of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , was released on parole less than a year ago and knut folkerts , who was paroled in 1995 after serving part of a life term for the murder of siegfried buback , west germany 's federal prosecutor at the time . however neither faces immediate arrest , since the order gave them leave to appeal and was frozen for the time being , federal prosecutors said thursday , jan .

jiang xingchang , vice-president of the supreme people 's court -lrb- spc -rrb- , said that the move was because lethal injections were considered more humane .
critics say china executes more people than any country in the world .
but beijing is gradually reforming its use of the death penalty .
last year the supreme court ordered judges to be more sparing in its imposition .
half of china 's 404 intermediate people 's courts - which carry out most of the country 's executions - now use lethal injections , jiang xingchang told the china daily .
mr jiang said that the method would eventually be used in all intermediate people 's courts , but he gave no timescale for the shift .
china 's death penalty china is believed to execute more people than rest of the world combined non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement carry death penalty other crimes include murder , rape , robbery and drug offences china does not publish official figures on executions many cases are based on confessions and trials often take less than a day , observers say " the spc will help equip intermediate courts with all required facilities and train more professionals , particularly in the central and western regions , " he told china daily .
death row inmates and their families backed the move , he said .
the other method involves prisoners being shot in the back of the head .
in recent months , the lethal injection has become a subject of much debate in the us .
the us supreme court is currently considering a case brought by two death row inmates who say the method inflicts unnecessary pain and suffering .
china 's chief justice xiao yang , meanwhile , told the newspaper that china was " working towards " more limited use of the death penalty , but ruled out ending the practice .
" we can not talk about abolishing or controlling the use of death sentences in the abstract without considering ground realities and social security conditions , " the daily quoted him as saying .
china does not release official statistics of its executions .
rights group amnesty international says that based on media reports an estimated 1,010 people were executed in 2006 - more than 60 % of global executions - but it described this number as only the tip of the iceberg .

jiang xingchang , vice-president of the supreme people 's court -lrb- spc -rrb- , said that the move was because lethal injections were considered more humane .
critics say china executes more people than any country in the world .
but beijing is gradually reforming its use of the death penalty .
last year the supreme court ordered judges to be more sparing in its imposition .
half of china 's 404 intermediate people 's courts - which carry out most of the country 's executions - now use lethal injections , jiang xingchang told the china daily .
mr jiang said that the method would eventually be used in all intermediate people 's courts , but he gave no timescale for the shift .
china 's death penalty china is believed to execute more people than rest of the world combined non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement carry death penalty other crimes include murder , rape , robbery and drug offences china does not publish official figures on executions many cases are based on confessions and trials often take less than a day , observers say " the spc will help equip intermediate courts with all required facilities and train more professionals , particularly in the central and western regions , " he told china daily .
death row inmates and their families backed the move , he said .
the other method involves prisoners being shot in the back of the head .
in recent months , the lethal injection has become a subject of much debate in the us .
the us supreme court is currently considering a case brought by two death row inmates who say the method inflicts unnecessary pain and suffering .
china 's chief justice xiao yang , meanwhile , told the newspaper that china was " working towards " more limited use of the death penalty , but ruled out ending the practice .
" we can not talk about abolishing or controlling the use of death sentences in the abstract without considering ground realities and social security conditions , " the daily quoted him as saying .
china does not release official statistics of its executions .

a committee of mps said " poor preparation " meant the department of communities and local government -lrb- dclg -rrb- lost its nerve and failed to deliver .
hips were supposed to be introduced in full from 1 june , but were implemented in stages for various sized properties .
the government said it deliberately phased the roll-out of hips " to ensure smooth implementation " .
hips , now compulsory for all homes being sold in england and wales , are intended to speed and improve the sale of homes and give buyers an energy rating for the property .
they were initially meant to include a report on the condition of the property - but the government decided to make that element voluntary .
introduction delayed the slimmed down packs , containing title deeds , local searches and an energy performance certificate , were then meant to be introduced from 1 june - but the week before , that was delayed until august - and then only for properties with at least four bedrooms .
in september they became compulsory for properties with three bedrooms , and in december for those with one or two bedrooms . "
there were not enough inspectors because clg first watered down and then repeatedly delayed the introduction of hips " mps ' report mps on the communities and local government select committee were not convinced by the reasons given for the problems in introducing hips .
they said both ministers and officials were not " forthcoming in oral evidence " .
permanent secretary peter housden had blamed an initial lack of qualified home inspectors and " conditions in the housing and mortgage market generally " .
but the mps ' report said there was a lack of inspectors because people were reluctant to pay out for training " for jobs the government would not guarantee would exist " .
earning potential and when home condition reports were dropped as a compulsory part of the hips , the " earning potential of those jobs dropped dramatically " , the mps said .
" there were not enough inspectors because clg first watered down and then repeatedly delayed the introduction of hips , " they said . "
we made a deliberate decision to phase the roll-out in order to ensure smooth implementation " iain wright housing minister and they said housing minister yvette cooper was " repeatedly unclear " about precisely what market conditions had caused the delay .
they also blamed a failure to win over " stakeholders " , like the royal institution of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- , who sought a judicial review of the decision to introduce hips at all - delaying them further .
they concluded the decisions to delay hips " were taken on political , rather than economic grounds , owing more to a failure of nerve in the face of vocal opposition from the press and others , than to general conditions prevailing in the housing market itself . "
' chaos and confusion ' shadow housing minister grant shapps criticised the " shambolic and secretive way " in which hips were introduced saying : " at a time when the housing market needs certainty and stability , labour provided chaos and confusion . "
but housing minister iain wright said : " it was not possible to introduce hips in june because of the rics legal action against the energy performance certificate and , due to the resulting uncertainty , the number of assessors available .
" and we made a deliberate decision to phase the roll-out in order to ensure smooth implementation . "
he said they had wanted to get an independent assessment of the impact of the first phase of hips before continuing , giving " changes taking place in the housing market over the autumn " .

permanent secretary peter housden had blamed an initial lack of qualified home inspectors and " conditions in the housing and mortgage market generally " .
but the mps ' report said there was a lack of inspectors because people were reluctant to pay out for training " for jobs the government would not guarantee would exist " .

they concluded the decisions to delay hips " were taken on political , rather than economic grounds , owing more to a failure of nerve in the face of vocal opposition from the press and others , than to general conditions prevailing in the housing market itself . "
' chaos and confusion ' shadow housing minister grant shapps criticised the " shambolic and secretive way " in which hips were introduced saying : " at a time when the housing market needs certainty and stability , labour provided chaos and confusion . "

" people have been very generous and we have also been contacted by people outside the town . "
mrs clark said as well as money , people had donated basic items the family would need in the months to come .
" they have not got anywhere to put them at the moment so we are storing them for now , " she said .
" we are not going to stop -lsb- collecting -rsb- for some time . "

the list was compiled by asking music critics and broadcasters for their favourite new artists , with the winner and full top 10 to be revealed on friday .
duffy 's journey from singing waitress to rising star once in a while , a startling new voice seemingly comes out of nowhere .
duffy 's home town of nefyn , north-west wales , is not known as a hotbed of timeless , rousing soul , and her parents did not buy many records .
" i started singing blues and soul songs when i was really young , " the 23-year-old explains .
" and i did n't really have a record collection that would explain that . "
nor did she grow up in a musical family .
" my mum does a terrible version of patsy cline 's crazy , " she says .
" my nan played the accordion in the war . "
she was even kicked out of the school choir for being too " rough round the edges " .
duffy says she did not fully discover how to use her voice until she was spotted by jeanette lee , a former member of public image limited and now duffy 's manager and mentor .
duffy has been described as the new dusty springfield only when lee put duffy into the studio to start recording her debut album several years ago did the singer begin to harness the full force of her vocal chords .
" i 'd never had the opportunity until i was in a studio and somebody pushed me up to those notes , " duffy says .
" i remember the day and i found something new .
so i 'm just learning about my voice at the moment as well . "
she has learnt enough to draw comparisons with dusty springfield , combining the poise of the late legend with the power of lulu and the pitch of dolly parton .
' exciting and fierce ' duffy insists she is still learning about the classic artists to whom she is compared .
" i did n't really know who dusty was and what she stood for , " she says .
" and now i understand her search for quality and her determination as an artist , and everything she achieved in this great collection of songs .
it was exciting and fierce and you never knew what the day was going to bring duffy on writing and recording with bernard butler " literally in the last month , i have only really started to understand . "
now she understands , she says she has a " long way to go " before she deserves those comparisons .
her debut album rockferry , released in the uk in march , may be a start .
some songs were written and recorded with former suede guitarist bernard butler , some with jimmy hogarth - who has worked with james blunt , james morrison and kt tunstall - and the rest with steve booker .
" with bernard it was exciting and fierce and you never knew what the day was going to bring , " duffy says .
" he 's a real artist and it 's really a great experience .
" with jimmy hogarth i 'd go in nine times out of 10 with an idea up my sleeve , and we 'd have six hours and go for it and write a song .
" and i met steve booker by compete coincidence .
i was looking for somewhere to live about a year ago , knocked on a door , met a songwriter , went to a studio and had an amazing two weeks writing the two last songs on the record . "
the end result , she says is " a real mix , which brings out different qualities in me " .
" which i like , because i think there 's different shades to everyone , and that 's what i was trying to get . "
' danceability ' the styles on the album reflect duffy 's own four-year journey from small town to big city , singing waitress to star-in-waiting .
" i started writing a record and reflecting what is , i think , southern soul , which is a slower paced soul , " she says .
" a little bit more from the country .
there 's no rush in the country .
" and then you get to the city and you face this northern soul - very upbeat , danceability , because the pace of life 's a little quicker .
" so i faced that in making the record .
i started in a place that was really laid back , came to the city and had the shock of my life and have had the most exciting times . "
almost 150 uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in the sound of 2008 poll .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile a top 10 .

" my nan played the accordion in the war . "
she was even kicked out of the school choir for being too " rough round the edges " .
duffy says she did not fully discover how to use her voice until she was spotted by jeanette lee , a former member of public image limited and now duffy 's manager and mentor .
duffy has been described as the new dusty springfield only when lee put duffy into the studio to start recording her debut album several years ago did the singer begin to harness the full force of her vocal chords .
" i 'd never had the opportunity until i was in a studio and somebody pushed me up to those notes , " duffy says .
" i remember the day and i found something new .
so i 'm just learning about my voice at the moment as well . "
she has learnt enough to draw comparisons with dusty springfield , combining the poise of the late legend with the power of lulu and the pitch of dolly parton .
' exciting and fierce ' duffy insists she is still learning about the classic artists to whom she is compared .
" i did n't really know who dusty was and what she stood for , " she says .
" and now i understand her search for quality and her determination as an artist , and everything she achieved in this great collection of songs .
it was exciting and fierce and you never knew what the day was going to bring duffy on writing and recording with bernard butler " literally in the last month , i have only really started to understand . "
now she understands , she says she has a " long way to go " before she deserves those comparisons .
her debut album rockferry , released in the uk in march , may be a start .
some songs were written and recorded with former suede guitarist bernard butler , some with jimmy hogarth - who has worked with james blunt , james morrison and kt tunstall - and the rest with steve booker .
" with bernard it was exciting and fierce and you never knew what the day was going to bring , " duffy says .
" he 's a real artist and it 's really a great experience .
" with jimmy hogarth i 'd go in nine times out of 10 with an idea up my sleeve , and we 'd have six hours and go for it and write a song .
" and i met steve booker by compete coincidence .
i was looking for somewhere to live about a year ago , knocked on a door , met a songwriter , went to a studio and had an amazing two weeks writing the two last songs on the record . "
the end result , she says is " a real mix , which brings out different qualities in me " .
" which i like , because i think there 's different shades to everyone , and that 's what i was trying to get . "
' danceability ' the styles on the album reflect duffy 's own four-year journey from small town to big city , singing waitress to star-in-waiting .
" i started writing a record and reflecting what is , i think , southern soul , which is a slower paced soul , " she says .
" a little bit more from the country .
there 's no rush in the country .
" and then you get to the city and you face this northern soul - very upbeat , danceability , because the pace of life 's a little quicker .
" so i faced that in making the record .
i started in a place that was really laid back , came to the city and had the shock of my life and have had the most exciting times . "

the office of rail regulation began the inquiry after west coast mainline work overran by two days .
the works at rugby have left the line closed between birmingham international and northampton and virgin has advised passengers not to use its trains .
london 's liverpool street station was also closed on wednesday due to overrunning works but has now reopened .
the railway terminal opened to passengers on thursday morning , a day late , after being closed for 10 days for work on a bridge and overheard cables .
have your say " i can not afford to go on a train so i use my car " darrell hughes send us your comments virgin said passengers could claim compensation if their journeys had been affected by the west coast mainline delays .
network rail apologised for the delays and said it was working " flat out " to restore normal services .
chris gibb , managing director of virgin trains , told the bbc that network rail said the line around rugby station would not reopen until 0500 gmt on friday .
birmingham international station was also forced to close on wednesday morning after a small fire broke out .
nobody was injured .
the regulator 's inquiry could lead to sanctions including a financial penalty .
tales of travel misery rail regulator chairman chris bolt said : " we fined network rail for its project planning and management failings after it failed to complete the portsmouth re-signalling project last christmas .
" it is extremely disappointing to have a repeat of that experience on key parts of the network . "
network rail has apologised to passengers for the disruption caused by the " unacceptable " overrun .
a spokesman said the " critical issue " was a shortage of specialist engineering staff , but additional manpower had been drafted in and was working hard to restore the services as quickly as possible .
operations and customer services director robin gisby said : " both these overruns are completely unacceptable and an urgent investigation into what has gone wrong has been launched . "
' major inconvenience ' the delays come as train passengers across the uk face above-inflation fare rises of up to 11 % .
regulated fares , which include most season tickets , are going up by an average of 4.8 % , and many unregulated fares are set to rise by much more .
consumer groups said the rises were unjustified , but train operators said they were needed for improvements .
rail operator virgin said it was exasperated about the west coast mainline delays and advised its passengers not to travel .
mr gibb said : " this is a major inconvenience to tens of thousands of our customers returning to work and it is not acceptable . "
replacement bus services were being provided between birmingham , coventry and northampton , but they were expected to add two hours to journey times .
the work had originally been expected to be finished by new year 's eve , as network rail had been hoping to complete the works over the festive period when there were fewer passengers .
virgin had already lodged a complaint with the rail regulator after network rail announced on 21 december that the works would run into new year 's eve .
passengers to and from london are being urged to use alternative routes as follows : birmingham - chiltern railways to marylebone nuneaton - cross country / east midlands trains via leicester to st pancras rugby - drive to kettering then east midlands trains to st pancras north west england - trans pennine express / east midlands trains via sheffield to st pancras north wales - virgin trains / cross country / chiltern railways via birmingham to marylebone scotland - national express east coast to king 's cross you can read a selection of readers ' comments below : as an employee for virgin trains , i would hope that passengers realise that the delays have been caused by network rail not completing engineering works and not by virgin trains .
far too often , people see delays on the railways and automatically blame the rail operator which in the majority of cases , it is not .

we have been given conflicting information from the travel phone line and both virgintrains.com and national rail website are telling us they can get back as normal via euston .

the journey was meant to be 1hr 40 mins but becomes a 45 min train journey , an 1 hr 30 mins bus journey followed by a 1 hr 30 mins train journey -lrb- although this is subject to delays -rrb- .

adrian , lichfield , uk i have been affected by the closure of liverpool street which delayed my journey to work .
i think the compensation offered for this sort of disruption is too low and the procedure to get it far too complicated .
local stations should be able to provide compensation on the day etc .

this has meant having to take a day as holiday but i felt this would be necessary at the time in order to avoid the usual nightmare of having to travel back from carlisle on the 1st of jan .
however it looks like it was a waste of a days holiday .
it is all well and good that virgin advise people to travel via alternate destinations however i have no option as i can not afford a new ticket and apparently the other train operators will not accept the value advance ticket which i purchased , meaning i 'm being punished for having bought my ticket well in advance .

the office of rail regulation began the inquiry after west coast mainline work overran by two days .
the works at rugby have left the line closed between birmingham international and northampton and virgin has advised passengers not to use its trains .
london 's liverpool street station was also closed on wednesday due to overrunning works but has now reopened .

network rail apologised for the delays and said it was working " flat out " to restore normal services .
chris gibb , managing director of virgin trains , told the bbc that network rail said the line around rugby station would not reopen until 0500 gmt on friday .
birmingham international station was also forced to close on wednesday morning after a small fire broke out .
nobody was injured .
the regulator 's inquiry could lead to sanctions including a financial penalty .

" it is extremely disappointing to have a repeat of that experience on key parts of the network . "
network rail has apologised to passengers for the disruption caused by the " unacceptable " overrun .
a spokesman said the " critical issue " was a shortage of specialist engineering staff , but additional manpower had been drafted in and was working hard to restore the services as quickly as possible .
operations and customer services director robin gisby said : " both these overruns are completely unacceptable and an urgent investigation into what has gone wrong has been launched . "
' major inconvenience ' the delays come as train passengers across the uk face above-inflation fare rises of up to 11 % .
regulated fares , which include most season tickets , are going up by an average of 4.8 % , and many unregulated fares are set to rise by much more .
consumer groups said the rises were unjustified , but train operators said they were needed for improvements .

mr gibb said : " this is a major inconvenience to tens of thousands of our customers returning to work and it is not acceptable . "
replacement bus services were being provided between birmingham , coventry and northampton , but they were expected to add two hours to journey times .
the work had originally been expected to be finished by new year 's eve , as network rail had been hoping to complete the works over the festive period when there were fewer passengers .
virgin had already lodged a complaint with the rail regulator after network rail announced on 21 december that the works would run into new year 's eve .
passengers to and from london are being urged to use alternative routes as follows : birmingham - chiltern railways to marylebone nuneaton - cross country / east midlands trains via leicester to st pancras rugby - drive to kettering then east midlands trains to st pancras north west england - trans pennine express / east midlands trains via sheffield to st pancras north wales - virgin trains / cross country / chiltern railways via birmingham to marylebone scotland - national express east coast to king 's cross you can read a selection of readers ' comments below : as an employee for virgin trains , i would hope that passengers realise that the delays have been caused by network rail not completing engineering works and not by virgin trains .

the office of rail regulation began the inquiry after west coast mainline work overran by two days .
the works at rugby have left the line closed between birmingham international and northampton and virgin has advised passengers not to use its trains .
london 's liverpool street station was also closed on wednesday due to overrunning works but has now reopened .

network rail apologised for the delays and said it was working " flat out " to restore normal services .
chris gibb , managing director of virgin trains , told the bbc that network rail said the line around rugby station would not reopen until 0500 gmt on friday .
birmingham international station was also forced to close on wednesday morning after a small fire broke out .
nobody was injured .
the regulator 's inquiry could lead to sanctions including a financial penalty .
tales of travel misery rail regulator chairman chris bolt said : " we fined network rail for its project planning and management failings after it failed to complete the portsmouth re-signalling project last christmas .
" it is extremely disappointing to have a repeat of that experience on key parts of the network . "
network rail has apologised to passengers for the disruption caused by the " unacceptable " overrun .
a spokesman said the " critical issue " was a shortage of specialist engineering staff , but additional manpower had been drafted in and was working hard to restore the services as quickly as possible .
operations and customer services director robin gisby said : " both these overruns are completely unacceptable and an urgent investigation into what has gone wrong has been launched . "
' major inconvenience ' the delays come as train passengers across the uk face above-inflation fare rises of up to 11 % .
regulated fares , which include most season tickets , are going up by an average of 4.8 % , and many unregulated fares are set to rise by much more .
consumer groups said the rises were unjustified , but train operators said they were needed for improvements .
rail operator virgin said it was exasperated about the west coast mainline delays and advised its passengers not to travel .
mr gibb said : " this is a major inconvenience to tens of thousands of our customers returning to work and it is not acceptable . "
replacement bus services were being provided between birmingham , coventry and northampton , but they were expected to add two hours to journey times .
the work had originally been expected to be finished by new year 's eve , as network rail had been hoping to complete the works over the festive period when there were fewer passengers .
virgin had already lodged a complaint with the rail regulator after network rail announced on 21 december that the works would run into new year 's eve .
passengers to and from london are being urged to use alternative routes as follows : birmingham - chiltern railways to marylebone nuneaton - cross country / east midlands trains via leicester to st pancras rugby - drive to kettering then east midlands trains to st pancras north west england - trans pennine express / east midlands trains via sheffield to st pancras north wales - virgin trains / cross country / chiltern railways via birmingham to marylebone scotland - national express east coast to king 's cross you can read a selection of readers ' comments below : as an employee for virgin trains , i would hope that passengers realise that the delays have been caused by network rail not completing engineering works and not by virgin trains .

so say security professionals predicting what net criminals will turn to in 2008 to catch people out .
the quasi-intimate nature of the sites makes people share information readily leaving them open to all kinds of other attacks , warn security firms .
detailed information gathered via the sites will also help tune spam runs or make phishing e-mail more convincing .
friendly faces there was no doubt that 2007 was the year that sites such as myspace , facebook , bebo , orkut rose to prominence as millions of people signed up to use them and started posting information about themselves and what they were up to .
but in 2008 these sites will become an attack vector for the hi-tech gangs who are now behind the vast majority of cyber crime .
mary landesman , senior security researcher at scansafe , said social sites would prove popular for two reasons .
" the technologies that play there and the third party add-ons make it an environment that is susceptible to compromise , " said ms landesman .
already at the end of 2007 brazilian users of google 's orkut were subject to an attack by a worm that tried to steal bank account details .
the malicious program , which also tried to hijack compromised computers , propagated via booby-trapped links placed on the personal page of orkut users .
still other attacks have tried to capitalise on the popularity of video clips seen on sites such as youtube by putting booby-trapped links on pages that show the short films .
alongside technical vulnerabilities in the networks go other problems with the amount of information that people share on social networking sites .
social sites help make phishing attacks look more plausible this data can give criminals knowledge about the names of employees at a company , insight in its managerial make-up or information about its processes to lend credibility to other attacks .
" that information can be very specific , very focused , " she said .
" it can mention company names , actual events and people . "
this information , said ms landesman , could help attackers embarking on social engineering attacks which attempt to con employees by posing as another worker or a business partner .
david porter , head of security and risk at detica , said the apparent familiarity of social network sites , which often help people build connections with people who share their interests and outlook meant many people were cavalier with their personal information .
" it is remarkable that people use social networking websites to publish details about their lives , loves , jobs and hobbies to the entire world that they would not dream of sharing with a stranger in a bar , " he said .
" such data is invaluable to identity fraudsters , " he said .
this move to exploit social network sites would also fuel a move away from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the windows operating system to gain control of a pc or steal data .
far better for the criminal , said paul king , senior security advisor for cisco , is to use those phishing e-mails to exploit the end user .
" so many attacks now are nothing to do with an exploit .
it 's about persuading you to click a link , " he said .
" there 's no vulnerability involved in you clicking on that .
none . "
the big challenge in 2008 for individuals and companies was coming to terms and recognising the sheer number of threats ranged against them .
but , he said , consumers and pc users should not feel stifled by all the potential security problems .
there were a lot of benefits to using social networking sites , said mr king and the downsides should not put people off using them .
" it 's about trying to manage risk rather than avoid risk , " he said .

so say security professionals predicting what net criminals will turn to in 2008 to catch people out .
the quasi-intimate nature of the sites makes people share information readily leaving them open to all kinds of other attacks , warn security firms .
detailed information gathered via the sites will also help tune spam runs or make phishing e-mail more convincing .
friendly faces there was no doubt that 2007 was the year that sites such as myspace , facebook , bebo , orkut rose to prominence as millions of people signed up to use them and started posting information about themselves and what they were up to .
but in 2008 these sites will become an attack vector for the hi-tech gangs who are now behind the vast majority of cyber crime .
mary landesman , senior security researcher at scansafe , said social sites would prove popular for two reasons .
" the technologies that play there and the third party add-ons make it an environment that is susceptible to compromise , " said ms landesman .
already at the end of 2007 brazilian users of google 's orkut were subject to an attack by a worm that tried to steal bank account details .
the malicious program , which also tried to hijack compromised computers , propagated via booby-trapped links placed on the personal page of orkut users .
still other attacks have tried to capitalise on the popularity of video clips seen on sites such as youtube by putting booby-trapped links on pages that show the short films .
alongside technical vulnerabilities in the networks go other problems with the amount of information that people share on social networking sites .
social sites help make phishing attacks look more plausible this data can give criminals knowledge about the names of employees at a company , insight in its managerial make-up or information about its processes to lend credibility to other attacks .
" that information can be very specific , very focused , " she said .
" it can mention company names , actual events and people . "
this information , said ms landesman , could help attackers embarking on social engineering attacks which attempt to con employees by posing as another worker or a business partner .
david porter , head of security and risk at detica , said the apparent familiarity of social network sites , which often help people build connections with people who share their interests and outlook meant many people were cavalier with their personal information .
" it is remarkable that people use social networking websites to publish details about their lives , loves , jobs and hobbies to the entire world that they would not dream of sharing with a stranger in a bar , " he said .
" such data is invaluable to identity fraudsters , " he said .
this move to exploit social network sites would also fuel a move away from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the windows operating system to gain control of a pc or steal data .
far better for the criminal , said paul king , senior security advisor for cisco , is to use those phishing e-mails to exploit the end user .
" so many attacks now are nothing to do with an exploit .
it 's about persuading you to click a link , " he said .
" there 's no vulnerability involved in you clicking on that .
none . "
the big challenge in 2008 for individuals and companies was coming to terms and recognising the sheer number of threats ranged against them .
but , he said , consumers and pc users should not feel stifled by all the potential security problems .
there were a lot of benefits to using social networking sites , said mr king and the downsides should not put people off using them .
" it 's about trying to manage risk rather than avoid risk , " he said .

" it is remarkable that people use social networking websites to publish details about their lives , loves , jobs and hobbies to the entire world that they would not dream of sharing with a stranger in a bar , " he said .
" such data is invaluable to identity fraudsters , " he said .
this move to exploit social network sites would also fuel a move away from attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the windows operating system to gain control of a pc or steal data .
far better for the criminal , said paul king , senior security advisor for cisco , is to use those phishing e-mails to exploit the end user .
" so many attacks now are nothing to do with an exploit .
it 's about persuading you to click a link , " he said .
" there 's no vulnerability involved in you clicking on that .
none . "
the big challenge in 2008 for individuals and companies was coming to terms and recognising the sheer number of threats ranged against them .
but , he said , consumers and pc users should not feel stifled by all the potential security problems .
there were a lot of benefits to using social networking sites , said mr king and the downsides should not put people off using them .

currently , government departments can not be held criminally responsible for data protection breaches .
but a report on the " truly shocking " loss of 25m people 's personal details by hm revenue and customs , the commons justice committee demands tougher laws .
the government welcomed the report and said it was considering measures to toughen up the data protection act .
the committee found there was a " widespread problem " and " systemic failings " in the government 's handling of personal data . "
it is frankly incredible , for example , that the measures hmrc has put in place were not already standard procedure " alan beith send us your comments its liberal democrat chairman alan beith said : " the scale of the data loss by government bodies and contractors is truly shocking but the evidence we have had points to further hidden problems .
" it is frankly incredible , for example , that the measures hmrc has put in place were not already standard procedure . "
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , he said information commissioner richard thomas , who gave evidence to the select committee , was warning of more personal data loss cases " in the pipeline " .
criminal value " -lrb- whitehall -rrb- departments are coming to him on almost a confessional basis , quite rightly , to report that they too have got problems . "
mr beith added : " it 's a very serious situation and it impairs the proper use of data , which is often very important both to individuals and in areas like child protection and dealing with criminal behaviour . "
proper data protection was still not routine , he warned , despite its " potentially immense value " among criminals . "
parliament is currently considering proposals to amend section 60 of the data protection act through the criminal justice and immigration bill " ministry of justice spokeswoman the report follows the loss of child benefit data on two discs sent unencrypted by hmrc in north east england to the national audit office in london .
further data losses have emerged as a result of investigations into how whitehall handles people 's details .
as well as new criminal laws , the committee wants stronger enforcement powers and better resources for the information commissioner .
' proper policing ' it also called for a legal obligation to report significant data losses to those affected and to the commissioner .
and mps said the need for a " proper approach " to data handling was even more important given the proposed database of every child in the uk , the proposed identity card scheme and moves to allow other eu member states access to data held in the uk on uk citizens .
the prime minister and chancellor apologised over the data loss row last month and an inquiry is under way , alongside a police investigation .
millions of families were told to be on the alert for fraudulent use of their details , which include children 's names , addresses and dates of birth and national insurance and bank details .
a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the need to strengthen data protection laws had been recognised before the child benefit discs were lost and a review had been commissioned in october .
" parliament is currently considering proposals to amend section 60 of the data protection act through the criminal justice and immigration bill , " she said .
" this will provide a custodial sanction as well as the existing fines for those found guilty of unlawfully obtaining or disclosing personal data . "

a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the need to strengthen data protection laws had been recognised before the child benefit discs were lost and a review had been commissioned in october .
" parliament is currently considering proposals to amend section 60 of the data protection act through the criminal justice and immigration bill , " she said .
" this will provide a custodial sanction as well as the existing fines for those found guilty of unlawfully obtaining or disclosing personal data . "

as well as new criminal laws , the committee wants stronger enforcement powers and better resources for the information commissioner .
' proper policing ' it also called for a legal obligation to report significant data losses to those affected and to the commissioner .
and mps said the need for a " proper approach " to data handling was even more important given the proposed database of every child in the uk , the proposed identity card scheme and moves to allow other eu member states access to data held in the uk on uk citizens .
the prime minister and chancellor apologised over the data loss row last month and an inquiry is under way , alongside a police investigation .
millions of families were told to be on the alert for fraudulent use of their details , which include children 's names , addresses and dates of birth and national insurance and bank details .
a ministry of justice spokeswoman said the need to strengthen data protection laws had been recognised before the child benefit discs were lost and a review had been commissioned in october .
" parliament is currently considering proposals to amend section 60 of the data protection act through the criminal justice and immigration bill , " she said .
" this will provide a custodial sanction as well as the existing fines for those found guilty of unlawfully obtaining or disclosing personal data . "
