" you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
bildunterschrift : emotions are running high in hesse 's election campaign , to the right , spd candidate ypsilanti peter struck , leader of the spd in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , called for clement to be thrown out of the party .
" whoever urges people not to vote spd should face exclusion from the party , " struck said at an election rally in bad homburg .
he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .
but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .
merkel 's cdu rules together with the spd in a " grand coalition " at the federal level .
kohl , fischer wade in controversy in an indication of the importance of the hesse election for german national politics and the passions it has generated , two former political heavyweights have weighed in the controversy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is to try and rally his party in hesse former chancellor and cdu member helmut kohl threw his weight behind koch on monday , jan 21 .
in an interview with mass-selling paper bild , koch said he supported koch 's position on juvenile crime .
" increasing crime committed by immigrants would n't be stemmed by making it a taboo , " kohl said .
after an absence from active politics for two years , former foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile campaigned his green party in hesse on monday .
polls show that the greens may lose ground in the state .
" a premier like this needs to be voted out of office , " fischer said about koch . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
bildunterschrift : emotions are running high in hesse 's election campaign , to the right , spd candidate ypsilanti peter struck , leader of the spd in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , called for clement to be thrown out of the party .
" whoever urges people not to vote spd should face exclusion from the party , " struck said at an election rally in bad homburg .
he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .
but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .
merkel 's cdu rules together with the spd in a " grand coalition " at the federal level .
kohl , fischer wade in controversy in an indication of the importance of the hesse election for german national politics and the passions it has generated , two former political heavyweights have weighed in the controversy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is to try and rally his party in hesse former chancellor and cdu member helmut kohl threw his weight behind koch on monday , jan 21 .
in an interview with mass-selling paper bild , koch said he supported koch 's position on juvenile crime .
" increasing crime committed by immigrants would n't be stemmed by making it a taboo , " kohl said .
after an absence from active politics for two years , former foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile campaigned his green party in hesse on monday .

" the road to russia is at this moment more open , and i 'll open the road to the european union . " tadic is generally seen as the pro-europe candidate .

it said germany had come out in support of the " one china " policy , which regard tibet and taiwan as chinese territory . the foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu also reinforced the message , saying beijing attributed " great importance " to friendly relations with germany . according to a report in spiegel magazine , merkel was aware that steinmeier had been exchanging letters with yang but was not informed about the details . yang is also expected in berlin on tuesday , jan 22 , for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and germany .

china was interested in extending " dialogue with germany on all levels , " the minister added . ties between china and germany plunged last year after merkel became the first the german leader to receive the dalai lama in the chancellery . her meeting with the exiled tibetan leader prompted china , which is hosting the olympic games from august , to cancel a series of high-level bilateral meetings and cultural events . the row raised fears among germany 's business leaders about the impact it could have on trade .
it also led to concerns that it could further complicate the west 's efforts to reach agreement with china on dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis . merkel said last week that she had no regrets about her historic meeting with the dalai lama , who has been branded a dangerous separatist by beijing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
bildunterschrift : emotions are running high in hesse 's election campaign , to the right , spd candidate ypsilanti peter struck , leader of the spd in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , called for clement to be thrown out of the party .
" whoever urges people not to vote spd should face exclusion from the party , " struck said at an election rally in bad homburg .
he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .
but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .
merkel 's cdu rules together with the spd in a " grand coalition " at the federal level .
kohl , fischer wade in controversy in an indication of the importance of the hesse election for german national politics and the passions it has generated , two former political heavyweights have weighed in the controversy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is to try and rally his party in hesse former chancellor and cdu member helmut kohl threw his weight behind koch on monday , jan 21 .
in an interview with mass-selling paper bild , koch said he supported koch 's position on juvenile crime .
" increasing crime committed by immigrants would n't be stemmed by making it a taboo , " kohl said .
after an absence from active politics for two years , former foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile campaigned his green party in hesse on monday .
polls show that the greens may lose ground in the state .
" a premier like this needs to be voted out of office , " fischer said about koch . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
bildunterschrift : emotions are running high in hesse 's election campaign , to the right , spd candidate ypsilanti peter struck , leader of the spd in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , called for clement to be thrown out of the party .
" whoever urges people not to vote spd should face exclusion from the party , " struck said at an election rally in bad homburg .
he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .

it said germany had come out in support of the " one china " policy , which regard tibet and taiwan as chinese territory . the foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu also reinforced the message , saying beijing attributed " great importance " to friendly relations with germany . according to a report in spiegel magazine , merkel was aware that steinmeier had been exchanging letters with yang but was not informed about the details . yang is also expected in berlin on tuesday , jan 22 , for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and germany .
they will discuss imposing further sanctions on iran for failing to halt sensitive nuclear work . merkel welcome in china ? meanwhile , german daily handelsblatt reported that chinese science and technology minister wang gang had said merkel is welcome in the chinese capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama sparked anger in china merkel is " welcome in beijing at any time , also for the olympic games , " wang told the business newspaper in an interview .
china was interested in extending " dialogue with germany on all levels , " the minister added . ties between china and germany plunged last year after merkel became the first the german leader to receive the dalai lama in the chancellery . her meeting with the exiled tibetan leader prompted china , which is hosting the olympic games from august , to cancel a series of high-level bilateral meetings and cultural events . the row raised fears among germany 's business leaders about the impact it could have on trade .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .

" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .
but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .
merkel 's cdu rules together with the spd in a " grand coalition " at the federal level .
kohl , fischer wade in controversy in an indication of the importance of the hesse election for german national politics and the passions it has generated , two former political heavyweights have weighed in the controversy .

in an interview with mass-selling paper bild , koch said he supported koch 's position on juvenile crime .
" increasing crime committed by immigrants would n't be stemmed by making it a taboo , " kohl said .
after an absence from active politics for two years , former foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile campaigned his green party in hesse on monday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .

he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .

" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
bildunterschrift : emotions are running high in hesse 's election campaign , to the right , spd candidate ypsilanti peter struck , leader of the spd in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , called for clement to be thrown out of the party .
" whoever urges people not to vote spd should face exclusion from the party , " struck said at an election rally in bad homburg .
he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .
but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .
merkel 's cdu rules together with the spd in a " grand coalition " at the federal level .
kohl , fischer wade in controversy in an indication of the importance of the hesse election for german national politics and the passions it has generated , two former political heavyweights have weighed in the controversy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is to try and rally his party in hesse former chancellor and cdu member helmut kohl threw his weight behind koch on monday , jan 21 .
in an interview with mass-selling paper bild , koch said he supported koch 's position on juvenile crime .
" increasing crime committed by immigrants would n't be stemmed by making it a taboo , " kohl said .
after an absence from active politics for two years , former foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile campaigned his green party in hesse on monday .
polls show that the greens may lose ground in the state .
" a premier like this needs to be voted out of office , " fischer said about koch . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german stocks continued their slide over worries about the us economy . just a few months ago westlb issued a statement assuring investors that its exposure to subprime securities in the united states was " relatively limited . " but the bank was much more vulnerable than it first admitted .
following a meeting of its owners late sunday , jan .
20 , westlb bank said the bank will need a bailout from stakeholders to offset a 1 billion euro loss .
the losses were caused in part by exposure to the subprime mortgage crisis in the united states . " the owners agree that in addition to the measures decided today , restructuring needs to be implemented and the bank 's refocusing should be accelerated , " westlb said in a statement . bank will face cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stocks continue downward march westlb is majority owned by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
westlb announced it was continuing talks to merge with state-owned helaba bank , a smaller frankfurt-based competitor .
the merger would create germany 's biggest state-owned bank . " our owners have proven that they stand fully behind the bank , " said westlb chief alexander stuhlmann . in a letter to investors stuhlmann said the bank could not exclude the possibility of additional losses in the future . the bank has said it will act quickly to reduce costs .
while media reports have said the bank plans to ax 2,000 jobs , a spokesman for westlb said the bank had not yet determined how it would go about reducing costs .

cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .

a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .

" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .

cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .

but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .

organizers plan to expand the service to include other groups as well . with every seventh european belonging to an ethnic minority , the federal union of european nationalities -lrb- fuen -rrb- works to provide a comprehensive picture of where the minorities are located , how they fare and what their legal status is in the countries where they live . fuen and the german interior ministry on thursday , jan .
17 , launched a new web portal with detailed information on the situation of german ethnic minorities throughout europe , but the site 's organizers say they plan to expand the online platform 's services . " if you have no knowledge at all regarding minorities , you need a certain overview : where do they come from , the historical aspect , the school aspect , " said frank nickelsen , fuen 's general-secretary and the person responsible for compiling much of the web-based material .
" in the near future we will also focus on very specific issues such as education , political participation and religion . " internet of increasing importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site currently documents only german minorities christoph bergner , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said he sees such web sites as increasingly important for ethnic minorities . " the internet will likely grow in importance among german minorities looking to maintain their cultural identity , " said bergner , who is also the german government 's commissioner for national minorities .
" i expect people to exchange experiences and help others who are in a similarly difficult position . " in denmark , france , poland , serbia , kazakhstan and hungary , there are an estimated two million ethnic german minority members spread across europe . nickelsen said he also believes ethnic minorities will turn to the internet to keep in touch and discuss issues related to their legal status , which differs from nation to nation .
the union also plans to expand the online platform to include other european minorities , he added . " a second step , for example , will be to focus on the non-kin state groups , " nickelsen said .
" i have members of the board who belong to a minority without a kin-state for example : a sorbian in germany and a cornish man in great britain . " an aid to dialog but addressing ethnic minorities ' concerns is of more than purely academic interest , according to fuen 's president , heinrich hansen , it can also help increase dialog and lower tension between ethnic groups with negative views of each other . " there is feeling that anyone who is different is dumb , " he said .
" that 's why my belief is that we need more dialog .
more dialog between majorities and minorities . " nickelsen said he hopes the site will help connect minority communities across europe and help them build a support network for themselves . " alone you are nothing ; you ca n't get your rights if you are alone , " he said .

it said germany had come out in support of the " one china " policy , which regard tibet and taiwan as chinese territory . the foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu also reinforced the message , saying beijing attributed " great importance " to friendly relations with germany . according to a report in spiegel magazine , merkel was aware that steinmeier had been exchanging letters with yang but was not informed about the details . yang is also expected in berlin on tuesday , jan 22 , for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and germany .

china was interested in extending " dialogue with germany on all levels , " the minister added . ties between china and germany plunged last year after merkel became the first the german leader to receive the dalai lama in the chancellery . her meeting with the exiled tibetan leader prompted china , which is hosting the olympic games from august , to cancel a series of high-level bilateral meetings and cultural events . the row raised fears among germany 's business leaders about the impact it could have on trade .
it also led to concerns that it could further complicate the west 's efforts to reach agreement with china on dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis . merkel said last week that she had no regrets about her historic meeting with the dalai lama , who has been branded a dangerous separatist by beijing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 21.01.2008 german luxury jewelers see profit boom despite gold rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many luxury items created by leicht jewelers the past year has seen a meteoric rise in gold prices , which is making life harder for mass market jewelry manufacturers .
but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .
the company specializes in the so-called " wellendorff rope " - a sensual-looking chain hand-made in 18 carat gold . " we do n't see any affect from the gold prices or diamond prices or from currency , " said the company 's managing director , christian wellendorff as he carefully unlocked a display box to show off a 13 m -lrb- 42 ft -rrb- long example of wellendorff rope that retails for 120,200 euros . " it 's like you buy a piece of art ; it 's not really the exchange rate that makes a decision on whether you want to buy or not , " wellendorff said , adding that his company 's turnover increased by 25 percent last year .
" either it 's beautiful and you want to have it and then you get it , or you do n't . " workmanship influences price operating from an unassuming building with a view of the town 's enz river is one of the world 's most famous luxury brands - faberge .
for jewelry companies operating at the high-end of the market , such as faberge , the cost of labor is the significant factor in determining the price . " traditionally faberge is using elaborate techniques and this means the value-added is in the craftsmanship ; it 's not so much the material , " said marcus mohr , the president of faberge jewelry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this faberge egg , showing the brandenburg gate , is made of 18 carat gold , jasper and diamonds according to mohr , russian-born peter carl faberge , who founded the company back in 1842 , once said he left the big diamonds to other jewelers and instead chose to focus on craftsmanship . " this means we are not depending on the increase of gold or other materials , " mohr said . specialized skills only found in pforzheim pointing to an elaborate faberge egg in the display room , mohr explained that its creation took six months and the efforts of some 15 highly specialized artisans .
considering german craftsmen and women earning among the highest wages in the manufacturing sector in the world , that 's a lot of labor costs .
according to mohr , however , locating the atelier offshore is n't a possibility . " these traditional techniques can only be done here -lrb- in pforzheim -rrb- , which means it is good that we are here because we have the talent , " mohr said .

but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .
the company specializes in the so-called " wellendorff rope " - a sensual-looking chain hand-made in 18 carat gold . " we do n't see any affect from the gold prices or diamond prices or from currency , " said the company 's managing director , christian wellendorff as he carefully unlocked a display box to show off a 13 m -lrb- 42 ft -rrb- long example of wellendorff rope that retails for 120,200 euros . " it 's like you buy a piece of art ; it 's not really the exchange rate that makes a decision on whether you want to buy or not , " wellendorff said , adding that his company 's turnover increased by 25 percent last year .
" either it 's beautiful and you want to have it and then you get it , or you do n't . " workmanship influences price operating from an unassuming building with a view of the town 's enz river is one of the world 's most famous luxury brands - faberge .
for jewelry companies operating at the high-end of the market , such as faberge , the cost of labor is the significant factor in determining the price . " traditionally faberge is using elaborate techniques and this means the value-added is in the craftsmanship ; it 's not so much the material , " said marcus mohr , the president of faberge jewelry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this faberge egg , showing the brandenburg gate , is made of 18 carat gold , jasper and diamonds according to mohr , russian-born peter carl faberge , who founded the company back in 1842 , once said he left the big diamonds to other jewelers and instead chose to focus on craftsmanship . " this means we are not depending on the increase of gold or other materials , " mohr said . specialized skills only found in pforzheim pointing to an elaborate faberge egg in the display room , mohr explained that its creation took six months and the efforts of some 15 highly specialized artisans .
considering german craftsmen and women earning among the highest wages in the manufacturing sector in the world , that 's a lot of labor costs .
according to mohr , however , locating the atelier offshore is n't a possibility . " these traditional techniques can only be done here -lrb- in pforzheim -rrb- , which means it is good that we are here because we have the talent , " mohr said .

" this means we are not depending on the increase of gold or other materials , " mohr said . specialized skills only found in pforzheim pointing to an elaborate faberge egg in the display room , mohr explained that its creation took six months and the efforts of some 15 highly specialized artisans .

following a meeting of its owners late sunday , jan .
20 , westlb bank said the bank will need a bailout from stakeholders to offset a 1 billion euro loss .
the losses were caused in part by exposure to the subprime mortgage crisis in the united states . " the owners agree that in addition to the measures decided today , restructuring needs to be implemented and the bank 's refocusing should be accelerated , " westlb said in a statement . bank will face cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stocks continue downward march westlb is majority owned by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
westlb announced it was continuing talks to merge with state-owned helaba bank , a smaller frankfurt-based competitor .
the merger would create germany 's biggest state-owned bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 21.01.2008 german luxury jewelers see profit boom despite gold rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many luxury items created by leicht jewelers the past year has seen a meteoric rise in gold prices , which is making life harder for mass market jewelry manufacturers .
but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold .

but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .

it said germany had come out in support of the " one china " policy , which regard tibet and taiwan as chinese territory . the foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu also reinforced the message , saying beijing attributed " great importance " to friendly relations with germany . according to a report in spiegel magazine , merkel was aware that steinmeier had been exchanging letters with yang but was not informed about the details . yang is also expected in berlin on tuesday , jan 22 , for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the united nations security council and germany .

it also led to concerns that it could further complicate the west 's efforts to reach agreement with china on dealing with the iranian nuclear crisis . merkel said last week that she had no regrets about her historic meeting with the dalai lama , who has been branded a dangerous separatist by beijing .

german stocks continued their slide over worries about the us economy . just a few months ago westlb issued a statement assuring investors that its exposure to subprime securities in the united states was " relatively limited . " but the bank was much more vulnerable than it first admitted .
following a meeting of its owners late sunday , jan .
20 , westlb bank said the bank will need a bailout from stakeholders to offset a 1 billion euro loss .
the losses were caused in part by exposure to the subprime mortgage crisis in the united states . " the owners agree that in addition to the measures decided today , restructuring needs to be implemented and the bank 's refocusing should be accelerated , " westlb said in a statement . bank will face cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stocks continue downward march westlb is majority owned by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
westlb announced it was continuing talks to merge with state-owned helaba bank , a smaller frankfurt-based competitor .
the merger would create germany 's biggest state-owned bank . " our owners have proven that they stand fully behind the bank , " said westlb chief alexander stuhlmann . in a letter to investors stuhlmann said the bank could not exclude the possibility of additional losses in the future . the bank has said it will act quickly to reduce costs .
while media reports have said the bank plans to ax 2,000 jobs , a spokesman for westlb said the bank had not yet determined how it would go about reducing costs . " the exact form of the measures and their timetable will be decided quickly , " westlb said . the bank said monday it wanted to reorganize its operations to focus more on mid-sized corporate clients . little initial concern in august 2007 , westlb said there was little reason for concern that it would get caught up in the us subprime crisis as 98 percent of the bank 's securities were rated " a " or better . " the commitment is relatively limited , and its rating is very high , which signals that we do not have to be too concerned , " a spokesman said . yet the bank did end up getting caught in the us subprime crisis , as did many other german institutions .
westlb 's announcement added to the concern on european stock markets about the scale of the fallout from the us housing market crisis with financial stocks leading big falls across europe monday . german market slips european stocks sank 2.2 percent in early trade on monday , trading just above the lowest level since august 2006 .
fears of a us recession and concerns over write-downs made investors nervous about banking stocks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westlb will look to slash expenses german stocks fell for a fifth day monday .
commerzbank led declines , dropping 87 cents to 20.21 euros on news that it was also being downgraded due to losses related to the subprime market tension .
the bank 's losses are expected to be about 210 million euros for the fourth quarter of 2007 , according to us investment bank bear stearns . " the situation remains tense , " michael scholz , an equity strategist with westlb ag told bloomberg television .
" january has been a disaster for share prices so far .
if this continues , we 'll have a problem this quarter . " the german government is still counting on the economy to grow in 2008 despite losses due to the financial markets crisis , a spokesman said on monday . " we think germany will continue to evolve positively " ulrich wilhelm told reporters .

17 , launched a new web portal with detailed information on the situation of german ethnic minorities throughout europe , but the site 's organizers say they plan to expand the online platform 's services . " if you have no knowledge at all regarding minorities , you need a certain overview : where do they come from , the historical aspect , the school aspect , " said frank nickelsen , fuen 's general-secretary and the person responsible for compiling much of the web-based material .
" in the near future we will also focus on very specific issues such as education , political participation and religion . " internet of increasing importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site currently documents only german minorities christoph bergner , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said he sees such web sites as increasingly important for ethnic minorities . " the internet will likely grow in importance among german minorities looking to maintain their cultural identity , " said bergner , who is also the german government 's commissioner for national minorities .
" i expect people to exchange experiences and help others who are in a similarly difficult position . " in denmark , france , poland , serbia , kazakhstan and hungary , there are an estimated two million ethnic german minority members spread across europe . nickelsen said he also believes ethnic minorities will turn to the internet to keep in touch and discuss issues related to their legal status , which differs from nation to nation .
the union also plans to expand the online platform to include other european minorities , he added . " a second step , for example , will be to focus on the non-kin state groups , " nickelsen said .
" i have members of the board who belong to a minority without a kin-state for example : a sorbian in germany and a cornish man in great britain . " an aid to dialog but addressing ethnic minorities ' concerns is of more than purely academic interest , according to fuen 's president , heinrich hansen , it can also help increase dialog and lower tension between ethnic groups with negative views of each other .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .
clement is a former spd deputy leader and ex-premier of germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia .
bildunterschrift : emotions are running high in hesse 's election campaign , to the right , spd candidate ypsilanti peter struck , leader of the spd in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , called for clement to be thrown out of the party .
" whoever urges people not to vote spd should face exclusion from the party , " struck said at an election rally in bad homburg .
he reiterated his criticism on monday , jan 21 .
" everyone has the right to an opinion .
he -lrb- clement -rrb- has to think about whether he 's in the right party , " struck told public broadcaster ard .
but spd leader kurt beck urged his party members to remain calm though he said he understood their outrage .
" we wo n't take him -lrb- clement -rrb- too seriously because he 's speaking here as a lobbyist for a big energy company , " beck told public broadcaster ndr .
" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "
clement has defended his criticism of the spd 's energy policies , rejecting accusations that he was speaking as a lobbyist for rwe .
in an interview with daily kölner stadtanzeiger , he said he was expressing a position he had fought for all his life and that he was sticking to his guns .
cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .
a brutal pre-christmas attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train prompted koch to seize on juvenile crime as the mainstay of his re-election campaign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch 's law and order message is n't going down well with voters however , koch 's campaign seems to have backfired .
just a few months ago , koch was expected to secure re-election with ease .
but latest opinion polls show he and spd candidate , andrea ypsilanti , who is campaigning with calls for a national minimum wage , running neck-and-neck .
a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .
merkel 's cdu rules together with the spd in a " grand coalition " at the federal level .
kohl , fischer wade in controversy in an indication of the importance of the hesse election for german national politics and the passions it has generated , two former political heavyweights have weighed in the controversy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer is to try and rally his party in hesse former chancellor and cdu member helmut kohl threw his weight behind koch on monday , jan 21 .
in an interview with mass-selling paper bild , koch said he supported koch 's position on juvenile crime .
" increasing crime committed by immigrants would n't be stemmed by making it a taboo , " kohl said .
after an absence from active politics for two years , former foreign minister joschka fischer meanwhile campaigned his green party in hesse on monday .
polls show that the greens may lose ground in the state .

but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth .

even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .
the company specializes in the so-called " wellendorff rope " - a sensual-looking chain hand-made in 18 carat gold . " we do n't see any affect from the gold prices or diamond prices or from currency , " said the company 's managing director , christian wellendorff as he carefully unlocked a display box to show off a 13 m -lrb- 42 ft -rrb- long example of wellendorff rope that retails for 120,200 euros . " it 's like you buy a piece of art ; it 's not really the exchange rate that makes a decision on whether you want to buy or not , " wellendorff said , adding that his company 's turnover increased by 25 percent last year .
" either it 's beautiful and you want to have it and then you get it , or you do n't . " workmanship influences price operating from an unassuming building with a view of the town 's enz river is one of the world 's most famous luxury brands - faberge .
for jewelry companies operating at the high-end of the market , such as faberge , the cost of labor is the significant factor in determining the price . " traditionally faberge is using elaborate techniques and this means the value-added is in the craftsmanship ; it 's not so much the material , " said marcus mohr , the president of faberge jewelry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this faberge egg , showing the brandenburg gate , is made of 18 carat gold , jasper and diamonds according to mohr , russian-born peter carl faberge , who founded the company back in 1842 , once said he left the big diamonds to other jewelers and instead chose to focus on craftsmanship .

considering german craftsmen and women earning among the highest wages in the manufacturing sector in the world , that 's a lot of labor costs .
according to mohr , however , locating the atelier offshore is n't a possibility . " these traditional techniques can only be done here -lrb- in pforzheim -rrb- , which means it is good that we are here because we have the talent , " mohr said .

organizers plan to expand the service to include other groups as well . with every seventh european belonging to an ethnic minority , the federal union of european nationalities -lrb- fuen -rrb- works to provide a comprehensive picture of where the minorities are located , how they fare and what their legal status is in the countries where they live . fuen and the german interior ministry on thursday , jan .
17 , launched a new web portal with detailed information on the situation of german ethnic minorities throughout europe , but the site 's organizers say they plan to expand the online platform 's services . " if you have no knowledge at all regarding minorities , you need a certain overview : where do they come from , the historical aspect , the school aspect , " said frank nickelsen , fuen 's general-secretary and the person responsible for compiling much of the web-based material .
" in the near future we will also focus on very specific issues such as education , political participation and religion . " internet of increasing importance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the site currently documents only german minorities christoph bergner , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , said he sees such web sites as increasingly important for ethnic minorities . " the internet will likely grow in importance among german minorities looking to maintain their cultural identity , " said bergner , who is also the german government 's commissioner for national minorities .
" i expect people to exchange experiences and help others who are in a similarly difficult position . " in denmark , france , poland , serbia , kazakhstan and hungary , there are an estimated two million ethnic german minority members spread across europe . nickelsen said he also believes ethnic minorities will turn to the internet to keep in touch and discuss issues related to their legal status , which differs from nation to nation .
the union also plans to expand the online platform to include other european minorities , he added . " a second step , for example , will be to focus on the non-kin state groups , " nickelsen said .
" i have members of the board who belong to a minority without a kin-state for example : a sorbian in germany and a cornish man in great britain . " an aid to dialog but addressing ethnic minorities ' concerns is of more than purely academic interest , according to fuen 's president , heinrich hansen , it can also help increase dialog and lower tension between ethnic groups with negative views of each other . " there is feeling that anyone who is different is dumb , " he said .
" that 's why my belief is that we need more dialog .
more dialog between majorities and minorities . " nickelsen said he hopes the site will help connect minority communities across europe and help them build a support network for themselves . " alone you are nothing ; you ca n't get your rights if you are alone , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clement has sparked outrage in the spd with his comments in a column for the conservative paper , welt am sonntag , clement said voters in hesse needed to consider spd candidate andrea ypsilanti 's opposition to nuclear power and coal-fired plants .
" whoever wants it the way she does must know : this can only be achieved to the detriment of hesse 's industrial substance … and that of germany , " clement wrote .
voters should " therefore choose and consider carefully , " who they wanted to run hesse , according to the former minister .
clement slammed as energy lobbyis t clement 's criticism of ypsilanti has angered the spd , further stoking a heated controversy surrounding the hesse election after the incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- premier roland koch latched on to crimes committed by foreigners in his election campaign .
many spd members say clement 's comments are linked to his current job with a major energy company .
in 2006 , shortly after leaving the federal government , clement joined the supervisory board of rwe power ag , a unit of one germany 's biggest utilities , the essen-based rwe .
" clement has unmasked himself as a lobbyist for industry , " ypsilanti 's spokesman frank steibli said .

" i have other things to deal with and not clement 's escapades . "

cdu losing ground in hesse the election in hesse , a politically and economically important state in germany that has been ruled by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- for nearly a decade , has stirred german public opinion after an openly xenophobic campaign by premier roland koch .
koch , who is seeking a third consecutive term as leader of hesse , has riled immigrant groups , the jewish community and germany 's left-wing voters and politicians with calls for deportation of " criminal foreigners " and an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants .

a recent infratest poll of 1,000 people for ard showed that no more than 38 percent of respondents would elect koch if they were able to vote for candidates directly compared with 48 percent for spd challenger ypsilanti .
the loss of hesse would be a huge embarrassment for chancellor angela merkel , who has been criticized for failing to rein in koch for his anti-foreigner comments .

but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .
the company specializes in the so-called " wellendorff rope " - a sensual-looking chain hand-made in 18 carat gold . " we do n't see any affect from the gold prices or diamond prices or from currency , " said the company 's managing director , christian wellendorff as he carefully unlocked a display box to show off a 13 m -lrb- 42 ft -rrb- long example of wellendorff rope that retails for 120,200 euros . " it 's like you buy a piece of art ; it 's not really the exchange rate that makes a decision on whether you want to buy or not , " wellendorff said , adding that his company 's turnover increased by 25 percent last year .
" either it 's beautiful and you want to have it and then you get it , or you do n't . " workmanship influences price operating from an unassuming building with a view of the town 's enz river is one of the world 's most famous luxury brands - faberge .
for jewelry companies operating at the high-end of the market , such as faberge , the cost of labor is the significant factor in determining the price . " traditionally faberge is using elaborate techniques and this means the value-added is in the craftsmanship ; it 's not so much the material , " said marcus mohr , the president of faberge jewelry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this faberge egg , showing the brandenburg gate , is made of 18 carat gold , jasper and diamonds according to mohr , russian-born peter carl faberge , who founded the company back in 1842 , once said he left the big diamonds to other jewelers and instead chose to focus on craftsmanship . " this means we are not depending on the increase of gold or other materials , " mohr said . specialized skills only found in pforzheim pointing to an elaborate faberge egg in the display room , mohr explained that its creation took six months and the efforts of some 15 highly specialized artisans .
considering german craftsmen and women earning among the highest wages in the manufacturing sector in the world , that 's a lot of labor costs .
according to mohr , however , locating the atelier offshore is n't a possibility . " these traditional techniques can only be done here -lrb- in pforzheim -rrb- , which means it is good that we are here because we have the talent , " mohr said .

but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .
the company specializes in the so-called " wellendorff rope " - a sensual-looking chain hand-made in 18 carat gold . " we do n't see any affect from the gold prices or diamond prices or from currency , " said the company 's managing director , christian wellendorff as he carefully unlocked a display box to show off a 13 m -lrb- 42 ft -rrb- long example of wellendorff rope that retails for 120,200 euros . " it 's like you buy a piece of art ; it 's not really the exchange rate that makes a decision on whether you want to buy or not , " wellendorff said , adding that his company 's turnover increased by 25 percent last year .
" either it 's beautiful and you want to have it and then you get it , or you do n't . " workmanship influences price operating from an unassuming building with a view of the town 's enz river is one of the world 's most famous luxury brands - faberge .
for jewelry companies operating at the high-end of the market , such as faberge , the cost of labor is the significant factor in determining the price . " traditionally faberge is using elaborate techniques and this means the value-added is in the craftsmanship ; it 's not so much the material , " said marcus mohr , the president of faberge jewelry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this faberge egg , showing the brandenburg gate , is made of 18 carat gold , jasper and diamonds according to mohr , russian-born peter carl faberge , who founded the company back in 1842 , once said he left the big diamonds to other jewelers and instead chose to focus on craftsmanship . " this means we are not depending on the increase of gold or other materials , " mohr said . specialized skills only found in pforzheim pointing to an elaborate faberge egg in the display room , mohr explained that its creation took six months and the efforts of some 15 highly specialized artisans .
considering german craftsmen and women earning among the highest wages in the manufacturing sector in the world , that 's a lot of labor costs .
according to mohr , however , locating the atelier offshore is n't a possibility . " these traditional techniques can only be done here -lrb- in pforzheim -rrb- , which means it is good that we are here because we have the talent , " mohr said .

but top-end jewelers in germany are experiencing booming sales as the luxury market expands . nestled on the edge of the black forest , the sleepy-looking town of pforzheim seems an unlikely place for one of the world 's major jewelry and watch centers .
not only are luxury pieces for brands such as faberge , chopard , dior , cartier , versace and tiffany produced here , pforzheim companies are also responsible for 70 percent of the 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- turned over by germany 's jewelry industry and watch industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the southern german city of pforzheim is proud of being the " gold city " pforzheim is also home to europe 's largest jewelry center , the world of jewelry , where visitors can wander the 4,000 square meters -lrb- 43,000 square feet -rrb- of exhibition and education space and admire some of the world 's most exquisite and expensive necklaces , earnings and bracelets . at the store of the family business leicht jewelers , pforzheim-born georg leicht proudly pointed out own of his own designs - a stunning hand-made necklace in pink gold with chunky antique coral beads .
the price tag is also stunning - 16,980 euros . the other items in the display case are equally beautiful and equally expensive .
but it seems customers are n't put off by the high prices .
according to leicht , his company has experienced regular growth over the past decade and gold prices are just fuelling demand because people are more likely to " accept gold as being something precious . " " the media attention to gold helps us to sell gold even if it is more expensive than it was before , " he said .
" i do n't think they buy -lrb- the jewelry -rrb- as an investment , but i think they feel good buying something they like that 's not only beautiful but it keeps its worth . " record gold high fails to dent sales gold prices have increased by 32 percent in the past year , and broke the $ 900 per ounce barrier for the first time ever earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold prices are expected to continue to rise throughout 2008 gold prices are n't passed on one to one to jewelry buyers .
even in the luxury market , pieces are n't normally made up of pure or 24 carat gold because it 's too soft to wear - rather , it is mixed with other metals to produce 18 carat gold , for example . in addition , gold is n't the only precious element in a piece of jewelry . " you still have the costs of the other stones , " leicht said .
" we do n't usually produce pieces consisting only of gold .
we also use diamonds , sapphires , rubies , and of course pearls , but price increases in precious stones are n't as strong as in gold . " exports on the rise exports account for a third of the german jewelry sector 's turnover and the majority of this is sold within europe , however , demand outside of the continent for " made in germany " jewelry is growing despite the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellendorff is doing extremely well in the overseas market the jewelry maker wellendorff , a family-run company founded in pforzheim in 1893 , sells 50 percent of its luxury exports to the united states and japan .
the company specializes in the so-called " wellendorff rope " - a sensual-looking chain hand-made in 18 carat gold . " we do n't see any affect from the gold prices or diamond prices or from currency , " said the company 's managing director , christian wellendorff as he carefully unlocked a display box to show off a 13 m -lrb- 42 ft -rrb- long example of wellendorff rope that retails for 120,200 euros . " it 's like you buy a piece of art ; it 's not really the exchange rate that makes a decision on whether you want to buy or not , " wellendorff said , adding that his company 's turnover increased by 25 percent last year .
" either it 's beautiful and you want to have it and then you get it , or you do n't . " workmanship influences price operating from an unassuming building with a view of the town 's enz river is one of the world 's most famous luxury brands - faberge .
for jewelry companies operating at the high-end of the market , such as faberge , the cost of labor is the significant factor in determining the price . " traditionally faberge is using elaborate techniques and this means the value-added is in the craftsmanship ; it 's not so much the material , " said marcus mohr , the president of faberge jewelry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this faberge egg , showing the brandenburg gate , is made of 18 carat gold , jasper and diamonds according to mohr , russian-born peter carl faberge , who founded the company back in 1842 , once said he left the big diamonds to other jewelers and instead chose to focus on craftsmanship . " this means we are not depending on the increase of gold or other materials , " mohr said . specialized skills only found in pforzheim pointing to an elaborate faberge egg in the display room , mohr explained that its creation took six months and the efforts of some 15 highly specialized artisans .
considering german craftsmen and women earning among the highest wages in the manufacturing sector in the world , that 's a lot of labor costs .
according to mohr , however , locating the atelier offshore is n't a possibility . " these traditional techniques can only be done here -lrb- in pforzheim -rrb- , which means it is good that we are here because we have the talent , " mohr said .

currently , the food standards agency sets an upper limit during pregnancy of 300mg - or four cups of coffee a day .
but an american journal of obstetrics and gynaecology study found more than 200mg of caffeine a day doubled the risk compared to abstainers .
experts said they would review the data to see if advice needed changing .
women probably should consider stopping caffeine consumption during pregnancy study author dr li pat o 'brien , consultant obstetrician and spokesman for the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists , said based on the findings he would now be advising women in their first 12 weeks of pregnancy to abstain from caffeine altogether .
" the first 12 weeks is a very vulnerable time for the baby .
it 's when most miscarriages occur , " he explained .
he said most women in early pregnancy went off the taste of caffeinated drinks anyway and so should not find abstaining from them too difficult .
but he said it was unclear whether pregnant women needed to avoid caffeine in later pregnancy .
miscarriage risk an estimated one in five pregnancies in the uk will end in miscarriage , affecting around 250,000 women in the uk every year .
there are a number of well-established risk factors , such as increased maternal age , a previous history of miscarriage , and infertility .
but the causes of the majority of miscarriages are not fully understood .
caffeine has been mooted as a risk factor before , but studies have yielded conflicting results .
for the latest research , dr de-kun li and colleagues at the kaiser permanente division of research , studied 1,063 women who had become pregnant in the last month or two .
300 mg of caffeine is roughly equivalent to : four average cups or three average mugs of instant coffee three average cups of brewed coffee six average cups of tea eight cans of regular cola drinks four cans of so-called " energy " drinks 400g -lrb- eight standard 50g bars -rrb- of normal chocolate caffeine content in a cup of tea or coffee varies by different brands and brewing methods source : food standards agency they asked the women to provide a detailed diary about their caffeine intake up to their 20th week of pregnancy .

compared with non-users , women who consumed up to 200mg of caffeine a day had an increased risk of miscarriage - 15 % versus 12 % .
for women who drank more than 200mg , the risk increased to 25 % .
abstinence the increased risk appeared to be related to the caffeine itself , rather than other coffee ingredients because other caffeinated beverages such as tea and hot chocolate showed a similar trend to coffee .
caffeine is able to cross the placenta to the foetus , but it is not clear what affect this has on the growing baby .
dr li said : " the main message for pregnant women from these findings is that they probably should consider stopping caffeine consumption during pregnancy . "

but an american journal of obstetrics and gynaecology study found more than 200mg of caffeine a day doubled the risk compared to abstainers .
experts said they would review the data to see if advice needed changing .
women probably should consider stopping caffeine consumption during pregnancy study author dr li pat o 'brien , consultant obstetrician and spokesman for the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists , said based on the findings he would now be advising women in their first 12 weeks of pregnancy to abstain from caffeine altogether .
" the first 12 weeks is a very vulnerable time for the baby .
it 's when most miscarriages occur , " he explained .
he said most women in early pregnancy went off the taste of caffeinated drinks anyway and so should not find abstaining from them too difficult .
but he said it was unclear whether pregnant women needed to avoid caffeine in later pregnancy .
miscarriage risk an estimated one in five pregnancies in the uk will end in miscarriage , affecting around 250,000 women in the uk every year .
there are a number of well-established risk factors , such as increased maternal age , a previous history of miscarriage , and infertility .
but the causes of the majority of miscarriages are not fully understood .
caffeine has been mooted as a risk factor before , but studies have yielded conflicting results .
for the latest research , dr de-kun li and colleagues at the kaiser permanente division of research , studied 1,063 women who had become pregnant in the last month or two .
300 mg of caffeine is roughly equivalent to : four average cups or three average mugs of instant coffee three average cups of brewed coffee six average cups of tea eight cans of regular cola drinks four cans of so-called " energy " drinks 400g -lrb- eight standard 50g bars -rrb- of normal chocolate caffeine content in a cup of tea or coffee varies by different brands and brewing methods source : food standards agency they asked the women to provide a detailed diary about their caffeine intake up to their 20th week of pregnancy .
when they compared this information with how many of the women had miscarried by 20 weeks gestation , 172 of the women in total , they found a link .
compared with non-users , women who consumed up to 200mg of caffeine a day had an increased risk of miscarriage - 15 % versus 12 % .
for women who drank more than 200mg , the risk increased to 25 % .
abstinence the increased risk appeared to be related to the caffeine itself , rather than other coffee ingredients because other caffeinated beverages such as tea and hot chocolate showed a similar trend to coffee .
caffeine is able to cross the placenta to the foetus , but it is not clear what affect this has on the growing baby .
dr li said : " the main message for pregnant women from these findings is that they probably should consider stopping caffeine consumption during pregnancy . "
have your say i do n't believe all this modern rubbish about what you should and should n't consume during pregnancy janet , romford , uk send us your comments zoe wheeldon from the british coffee association said the latest research , although well designed and robust , did not change the current food standards agency recommendation of a safe upper limit of 300mg of caffeine per day for pregnant women .
" this evidence must be reviewed in conjunction with existing research and it is important to review all the available data rather than taking one study in isolation . "
a spokesman from the food standards agency said : " in order to provide a more robust basis for the fsa 's advice to pregnant women on caffeine consumption , an fsa-funded study , involving around 2,500 pregnant women , was commissioned in 2003 .
" this is almost complete and the results will be presented to the committee on toxicity in closed session for consideration .
" we will ask the committee to also look at this new american study .
when the committee has reached conclusions the agency will , if appropriate , revise its advice on caffeine consumption in pregnancy . "

poor working conditions and the lure of better paid jobs in the country 's booming mining sector have led to an exodus of shearers .
sheep-shearing is one of the toughest jobs in australia .
it involves long hours dragging sheep out of their pens and removing their tangled fleeces with electric clippers .
australia 's sheep shearers have been deserting the industry in droves .
the most recent figures show that between 2003 and 2006 almost a quarter walked away .
the shearing sheds have faced tough competition from australia 's mining sector , which has experienced unprecedented growth .
it has offered better wages and less demanding working conditions .
' hard job ' shearing is often a back-breaking job , where thousands of kilos of sheep meat are shifted every day .
joe sullivan from research company australian wool innovation says workers continue to leave the industry .
" let 's be honest - one , it 's a hard , physical job , " he said .
" shearers have a limited lifespan in the role but also because of competing industries and with the resources boom , we 're having quite a significant demand for labour from the mining industry . "
australia 's long-standing drought has reduced sheep numbers and although farmers need fewer shearers there still are not enough to go round .
efforts are being made to attract new recruits and increase productivity .
there are training courses around the country and researchers are looking at ways to make the job easier .
a good shearer can get through 200 sheep a day , but the punishing work often leads to chronic back pain and other injuries .

" let 's be honest - one , it 's a hard , physical job , " he said .
" shearers have a limited lifespan in the role but also because of competing industries and with the resources boom , we 're having quite a significant demand for labour from the mining industry . "

the proposals come as 15,000 officers prepare to stage a mass march over pay in westminster on wednesday .
officers are currently given an annual pay increase of between 2 % and 6 % for the first 10 years of service , on top of the agreed national pay rise .
the ippr says this discourages officers from developing specialist skills .
" this system does not reward expertise and discourages officers from developing much-needed specialist skills , such as tackling violent and gang-related crime , " the report said .
" it also fails to reward officers who do the most difficult or dangerous roles , such as emergency response work . "
no system of pay is fair that rewards people solely on the basis of time served rather than their ability to do the job effectively guy lodge , ippr report reignites police pay row the report - which will be published in full next month - also says that while crime has fallen dramatically since 1997 , police performance has not significantly improved in the same period .
despite an increase in police funding of more than a quarter in real terms since 2001 , crime detection has remained flat .
in 2006/07 each warranted officer detected about 10 crimes a year , the same level as in 2001 .
spokesman guy lodge said : " we all know that the police do a difficult and challenging job , but no system of pay is fair that rewards people solely on the basis of time served rather than their ability to do the job effectively .
jacqui smith 's decision to stage a 2.5 % pay rise has angered officers " the current row over pay levels is preventing much-needed debate about how we reward police officers and how we deliver a high-performing police service . "
he added : " you could have a system whereby detection levels and those sorts of things are part of a police pay system , but the core message we are trying to put is that ... pay should be linked to skills . "
mr lodge warned , however , that too much concentration on detections or other statistics could run the risk of making the reforms too bureaucratic .
a home office spokesman said : " the home office together with acpo and apa are considering the issue of police pay structural reform .
i do n't think we should be starting from the reward system jan berry police federation " this work is at a very early stage looking at what the objectives should be for any reform of this nature .
" superintendents , chief superintendents and chief officer ranks already have pay based on performance as part of their pay arrangements . "
but the plans have been criticised by the police federation which represents rank-and-file officers .
its head , jan berry , told bbc radio five live 's breakfast programme : " i do n't think we should be starting from the reward system .
" i think we should be starting from the other end and looking at what we want our police service to do , what do we value , how should we structure it , how should we be made accountable , what workforce , then look at what rewards we pay them . "
explicit approval thousands of off-duty officers from across britain are planning to march on whitehall in anger at a government decision to overturn a pay award decided by the independent arbitration process .
home secretary jacqui smith decided to stage a 2.5 % pay rise , reducing the value of the rise to 1.9 % for the year .
in contrast , the scottish government agreed to backdate the 2.5 % rise to 1 september , as recommended by the police arbitration tribunal .
the conservatives want new laws to force governments to get the explicit approval of the house of commons to overturn any arbitration ruling on police pay .
it would extend it to armed forces and the prison service - a total of more than 360,000 uniformed personnel .
the police , like the military , are banned by law from striking .
" whilst it is impossible for any government to give up in totality the right to overrule a pay award in the public sector - simply because there is always the possibility of some unforeseen financial pressures - it is vital to act in good faith on these matters , " said shadow home secretary david davis .
" we believe that this new approach is fair , reasonable and will serve the public interest . "

the proposals come as 15,000 officers prepare to stage a mass march over pay in westminster on wednesday .
officers are currently given an annual pay increase of between 2 % and 6 % for the first 10 years of service , on top of the agreed national pay rise .
the ippr says this discourages officers from developing specialist skills .
" this system does not reward expertise and discourages officers from developing much-needed specialist skills , such as tackling violent and gang-related crime , " the report said .
" it also fails to reward officers who do the most difficult or dangerous roles , such as emergency response work . "

jacqui smith 's decision to stage a 2.5 % pay rise has angered officers " the current row over pay levels is preventing much-needed debate about how we reward police officers and how we deliver a high-performing police service . "
he added : " you could have a system whereby detection levels and those sorts of things are part of a police pay system , but the core message we are trying to put is that ... pay should be linked to skills . "

home secretary jacqui smith decided to stage a 2.5 % pay rise , reducing the value of the rise to 1.9 % for the year .

the proposals come as 15,000 officers prepare to stage a mass march over pay in westminster on wednesday .
officers are currently given an annual pay increase of between 2 % and 6 % for the first 10 years of service , on top of the agreed national pay rise .
the ippr says this discourages officers from developing specialist skills .
" this system does not reward expertise and discourages officers from developing much-needed specialist skills , such as tackling violent and gang-related crime , " the report said .
" it also fails to reward officers who do the most difficult or dangerous roles , such as emergency response work . "
no system of pay is fair that rewards people solely on the basis of time served rather than their ability to do the job effectively guy lodge , ippr report reignites police pay row the report - which will be published in full next month - also says that while crime has fallen dramatically since 1997 , police performance has not significantly improved in the same period .
despite an increase in police funding of more than a quarter in real terms since 2001 , crime detection has remained flat .
in 2006/07 each warranted officer detected about 10 crimes a year , the same level as in 2001 .
spokesman guy lodge said : " we all know that the police do a difficult and challenging job , but no system of pay is fair that rewards people solely on the basis of time served rather than their ability to do the job effectively .
jacqui smith 's decision to stage a 2.5 % pay rise has angered officers " the current row over pay levels is preventing much-needed debate about how we reward police officers and how we deliver a high-performing police service . "
he added : " you could have a system whereby detection levels and those sorts of things are part of a police pay system , but the core message we are trying to put is that ... pay should be linked to skills . "
mr lodge warned , however , that too much concentration on detections or other statistics could run the risk of making the reforms too bureaucratic .
a home office spokesman said : " the home office together with acpo and apa are considering the issue of police pay structural reform .
i do n't think we should be starting from the reward system jan berry police federation " this work is at a very early stage looking at what the objectives should be for any reform of this nature .
" superintendents , chief superintendents and chief officer ranks already have pay based on performance as part of their pay arrangements . "
but the plans have been criticised by the police federation which represents rank-and-file officers .
its head , jan berry , told bbc radio five live 's breakfast programme : " i do n't think we should be starting from the reward system .
" i think we should be starting from the other end and looking at what we want our police service to do , what do we value , how should we structure it , how should we be made accountable , what workforce , then look at what rewards we pay them . "
explicit approval thousands of off-duty officers from across britain are planning to march on whitehall in anger at a government decision to overturn a pay award decided by the independent arbitration process .
home secretary jacqui smith decided to stage a 2.5 % pay rise , reducing the value of the rise to 1.9 % for the year .
in contrast , the scottish government agreed to backdate the 2.5 % rise to 1 september , as recommended by the police arbitration tribunal .
the conservatives want new laws to force governments to get the explicit approval of the house of commons to overturn any arbitration ruling on police pay .
it would extend it to armed forces and the prison service - a total of more than 360,000 uniformed personnel .
the police , like the military , are banned by law from striking .
" whilst it is impossible for any government to give up in totality the right to overrule a pay award in the public sector - simply because there is always the possibility of some unforeseen financial pressures - it is vital to act in good faith on these matters , " said shadow home secretary david davis .
" we believe that this new approach is fair , reasonable and will serve the public interest . "

the british heart foundation -lrb- bhf -rrb- and the children 's food campaign are calling for the rules on packaging and online marketing to be tightened .
a ban on adverts for junk food during television programmes aimed at children under 16 is already in force .
the government said time was needed to assess the impact of the existing law before extending it .
a bhf survey found many parents were unaware some food firms had online games aimed at children and more than half did not realise that games and quizzes appeared on food and drink labels .
regulation ' limited ' the survey questioned 1,069 parents of children aged seven to 14 years in november .
it found only 30 % were aware that some junk food firms used online games to attract children .
and 52 % of parents did not realise that games and quizzes appeared on food and drink labels .
the bhf and the children 's food campaign want the existing regulations extended to cover all forms of marketing aimed at children .

they say the current regulation is limited and allows some forms of marketing to slip through the net .

" we must have a proper opportunity to assess the impact of these new rules , which are amongst the toughest in the world , before considering further restrictions , " he said .
" restrictions on advertising are just one part of a much broader set of actions government is taking to support the public health agenda . "
the food and drink federation has described the calls for further restrictions as " not based on reality " .

the israeli press is reporting that the satellite will improve israel 's ability to monitor iran 's military activities .
indian officials that given these sensitivities , the operation was secret and carried out under tight security .
the tecsar satellite - sometimes referred to as the polaris - was put into space on monday morning .
' sinister tie-up ' tecsar is said to have enhanced footage technology , which allows it to transmit images regardless of daytime and weather conditions .
it is considered to be one of the most advanced spy satellites that india has put into orbit to date .
correspondents say the launch was the second commercial mission on behalf of another country that has been carried out by the indian space research organisation .
" it was a grand success , " an unnamed official told the afp news agency from the southern state of andhra pradesh .
israeli newspapers reported that both israeli and indian space engineers were at the launch , and that 80 minutes afterwards , the israel aerospace industries ' -lrb- iai -rrb- ground station began receiving tecsar 's first signals .
the 300kg -lrb- 650-pound -rrb- satellite is reported to be israel 's most advanced space craft , and equipped with a camera that can take pictures in almost any weather conditions .
israel reportedly took the decision to launch the satellite from india three years ago , and asked for delhi 's help because it lacks a vehicle capable of boosting the satellite into a polar orbit .
" the kind of low-earth polar orbit they are putting the satellite into , it is meant to give israel the capability to keep an eye on the iranian nuclear programme , " an unnamed defence analyst told the afp news agency .
" this is bound to be seen in the islamic world as a sinister tie-up between israel and india , " he said .
experts also say that the launch is an " important milestone " in the commercialisation of india 's 45-year-old space programme , which put an italian satellite in orbit in april last year for a fee of $ 11m .
correspondents say that india is eager to compete against the us , russia , china , the ukraine and the european space agency in providing commercial satellite launch services , a market worth about $ 2.5bn a year .
india started its space programme in 1963 , and has since designed , built and launched its own satellites into space .

the israeli press is reporting that the satellite will improve israel 's ability to monitor iran 's military activities .
indian officials that given these sensitivities , the operation was secret and carried out under tight security .
the tecsar satellite - sometimes referred to as the polaris - was put into space on monday morning .
' sinister tie-up ' tecsar is said to have enhanced footage technology , which allows it to transmit images regardless of daytime and weather conditions .
it is considered to be one of the most advanced spy satellites that india has put into orbit to date .
india is eager to compete in the world space technology market correspondents say the launch was the second commercial mission on behalf of another country that has been carried out by the indian space research organisation .
" it was a grand success , " an unnamed official told the afp news agency from the southern state of andhra pradesh .
israeli newspapers reported that both israeli and indian space engineers were at the launch , and that 80 minutes afterwards , the israel aerospace industries ' -lrb- iai -rrb- ground station began receiving tecsar 's first signals .
the 300kg -lrb- 650-pound -rrb- satellite is reported to be israel 's most advanced space craft , and equipped with a camera that can take pictures in almost any weather conditions .
israel reportedly took the decision to launch the satellite from india three years ago , and asked for delhi 's help because it lacks a vehicle capable of boosting the satellite into a polar orbit .
" the kind of low-earth polar orbit they are putting the satellite into , it is meant to give israel the capability to keep an eye on the iranian nuclear programme , " an unnamed defence analyst told the afp news agency .
" this is bound to be seen in the islamic world as a sinister tie-up between israel and india , " he said .
experts also say that the launch is an " important milestone " in the commercialisation of india 's 45-year-old space programme , which put an italian satellite in orbit in april last year for a fee of $ 11m .
correspondents say that india is eager to compete against the us , russia , china , the ukraine and the european space agency in providing commercial satellite launch services , a market worth about $ 2.5bn a year .
india started its space programme in 1963 , and has since designed , built and launched its own satellites into space .

but those regarded as heroes by one political regime are often denounced as villains by the next , their statues left unloved or toppled and carted off to the wilderness . "
whenever i get my hands on a copy of the newspaper that my american friends persist in calling the london times , i almost invariably turn first of all to the obituary pages and the death notices .
this is partly to satisfy myself that i 'm still here , but i do so primarily to read about the lives and careers of the recently-deceased , and to find out the age at which they actually passed on .
as i get older , this becomes an increasingly significant -lrb- and discouraging -rrb- consideration , and i suspect i 'm far from being alone in finding this to be so .
chris patten once remarked that when he read the obituary pages , he always averaged out the ages of those whose deaths were reported , and then he subtracted his own accumulated years from the figure he had calculated , so as to get a rough idea of how much time and how many years he himself had got left to go . "
truly , i felt , this was the final graveyard of the british empire " hear radio 4 's a point of view earlier this month , on 2 january to be precise , the times printed an obituary of a remarkable and unusual man named nigel bathurst hankin .
it was nothing like the extended treatment recently lavished on benazir bhutto or which sir edmund hillary has just received , i doubt if many readers of the times would even have heard of him , and hankin had lived most of his long life abroad , in india , where he had died last november at the age of 87 .
but i remember him vividly as i was fortunate enough to meet him about five years ago .
nigel hankin had been born in england and brought up by his grandmother in bexhill .
he had served in the british army during the second world war , and he told me that he had fought in north africa .
from there , he was transferred to india , en route to burma , in 1945 .
but the war ended before he got beyond bombay , and two years later , india was independent .
but hankin had fallen in love with the country , and unlike many british civil servants and military men , he resolved to stay on , joining the newly-established indian army as a captain .
he later ran a mobile cinema , and then worked for the british high commission , where he would show diplomats and visitors the sights of what he would call " working delhi " , as distinct from " tourists ' delhi " .
during the 1960s , he began work on a glossary of indian english , which he eventually published in 1992 , under the far from brief title of hanklyn-janklin : a stranger 's rumble-tumble guide to some words , customs and quiddities , indian and indo-british .
here one can learn that a female educator is a " teachress " , that a young man who whistles at a woman is an " eve-teaser " , and that an " ear cleaner " is an " urban itinerant professional gentleman identified by his small red turban into which are tucked his instruments : tweezers , probes and buds of cotton wool " .
hankin who never married was fascinated by indian life , and he never considered returning to britain .
he came back in 1982 to visit his brother , but he found the place so dull that he returned to india after only three months .
when asked why his native land failed to lure him back , his reply was cryptic and revealing : he " missed the chaos " .
yet although hankin learned the local languages , and was well known in the streets and markets of " working delhi " , he never assimilated into the indian way of life , but always remained a detached -lrb- though sympathetic -rrb- observer .
although he 'd lived in the country for more than 60 years , he always breakfasted on cornflakes , eggs and bacon , which were brought to him by his devoted man servant , and his dinner invariably began with soup . "
earthly power is transient , and that imperial dominion is ephemeral . "
david cannadine i met nigel hankin early in 2003 , when my wife and i were visiting new delhi .
i was merely a tourist , but my wife was there to gather material for a lecture she had to deliver later that year in london , which explored the similarities and the differences between the political cultures of india and pakistan , as they had evolved since 1947 out of britain 's partitioned indian empire .
in one terrible way , their politics have developed along similar lines -lrb- across the last half century -rrb- : dynastic leadership and hereditary power , modified by murder and assassination , as the killing of benazir bhutto has recently reminded us .
but in other ways , india and pakistan are very different countries , with very different politics : in india , the military is subordinate to a thriving and disputatious democracy ; in pakistan , it is very much the other way round .
like many visitors to delhi , my wife and i were taken on a tour by nigel hankin .
he did n't bother with the obvious sights , such as the red fort or the great palace sir edwin lutyens had designed , which had once been known as viceroy 's house .
nor did we spend time navigating the wide avenues and enormous roundabouts that are so characteristic of new delhi , and which invariably remind western visitors of the layouts of paris or washington .
instead , hankin took us to the unprepossessing house where indira gandhi had lived - and died - while she was prime minister , and we even stood in the garden , on the very spot where some members of her bodyguard had struck her down .
and then we went off to delhi 's wholesale market , where we made our way through the dingy alleys and jostling crowds to the stalls where powerful herbs and eye-watering spices were being sold , and we emerged , coughing , wheezing , spluttering and most impressed , into the sunlight outside .
but nigel hankin had n't done with us yet .
over lunch , i happened to mention that one of my historical interests was imperial ritual and ceremonial , and that afternoon , we were borne off to a large open space , on the edge of delhi , which had been the setting for the great durbar , or " imperial assemblage " of 1877 , when the british viceroy , lord lytton , had proclaimed queen victoria to be empress of india .
a quarter of a century later , in 1903 , lord curzon staged an even more stupendous durbar on the very same spot , to proclaim king edward vii emperor of india ; and the climax of such imperial pomp and circumstance came in december 1911 , when king george v and queen mary appeared in person to be crowned as emperor and empress - an extraordinary extravaganza that was caught on film , some of which was shown as the opening sequence of paul scott 's raj quartet , when it was televised as the jewel in the crown .
this was the place in which my wife and i now found ourselves , on a hot january afternoon , guided there by nigel hankin .
but although he showed us photographs of viceroys and ruling princes and richly caparisoned elephants , it was almost impossible to imagine that this neglected , overgrown , obscure piece of ground had once been the setting for such confident display and colourful spectaculars .
on the contrary , it conveyed the very opposite message : that earthly power is transient , and that imperial dominion is ephemeral .
and as we followed hankin , through the weeds and undergrowth , to the remotest part of the site , we came upon a most astonishing scene : a dozen immense statues , rising up from the bushes and the brambles , like the chessmen arrayed for that terrifying contest towards the end of the first harry potter film .
it took only the briefest of inspections to establish who these men were : many of them had been british viceroys , among them lord halifax and lord willingdon , and there was also a statue of the king-emperor george v himself who , like the viceroys who had represented him , was clad in full imperial fig .
originally , these statues had been placed on the traffic islands where the great avenues of new delhi had intersected , or at the end point of some appropriately grand imperial vista .
but following indian independence , these symbols of imperial rule were no longer deemed acceptable , and they were banished to this obscure and distant setting where i happened upon them : a job-lot of statues of superannuated imperial personages , forgotten , unloved and un-cared-for , whom no one in free , democratic india wanted to see any more as they drove or walked along the streets of new delhi .
truly , i felt , this was the final graveyard of the british empire .
the statues i encountered on that hot and dusty indian afternoon had been placed by the british in new delhi to be permanent monuments to men whose lives and deeds they deemed worthy of everlasting commemoration .
but in india as elsewhere , those who are regarded as exemplary heroes by one political regime are often derided and denounced as villains and aliens in the next ; and this is especially so when empires fall , and when dictators are vanquished .
following the collapse of communism in eastern europe and in russia , statues of marx and lenin were toppled and felled from their podiums , and consigned to dismembered oblivion .
and when american forces captured baghdad in april 2003 , some of the most graphic and symbolic images that made the news were of us marines and iraqis tearing down a forty foot statue of saddam hussein .
as these examples suggest , such visible forms of commemoration are no guarantee of immortality .
instead of yearning for a statue , it 's probably better to settle for an obituary in the london times . "
below is a selection of your comments .
i also recall going on a fascinating visit around delhi led by nigel hankin in 1989 , at a time when i was living and working in nepal .
the tour included a visit to the site of the 1911 delhi durbar with its discarded statues including the massive statue of george v that had previously stood atop a plinth on kings way , now raj path , near new delhi 's india gate .
nigel 's analysis of the " statue graveyard " differed somewhat from the conclusions drawn by david cannadine .
whilst it 's true that the site outside delhi contains many statues , it also has many more empty plinths , prepared in expectation that unwanted statues from all over newly independent india would soon be making their way there .
however , nigel was quick to point out that many indian towns and cities actually felt rather affectionately disposed towards their rather bombastic imperial relics and were reluctant to be relieved of them .
hence the empty plinths in new delhi , and the numerous imperial statues that remain in their original locations around india .
gareth wardell , selby , north yorkshire , uk .
what a fascinating article .
it reminded me of one of my highlights of budapest - their fabulous statue park , where astride a hill above the city all the former soviet statues are collected .
period music plays and you are free to sit on the feet of stalin .
the best bit has to be the housing estate around the park - what an eerie way to wake up , draw the curtains and look out on lenin saluting you .
vicki , london , uk i met nigel hankin on a trip to delhi in 1999 .
he was a very special person who brought delhi alive .
once off the tourist trail india is an intriguing place you have to go back again and again .
nigel 's tour into the old delhi markets was the catalyst for me .
bob pritchard , brockham surrey the sight of a statue of lord willingdon would look well here in north burnaby where a main street is willingdon avenue , and is about to be widened in 2008 .
is the actual statue available / transported to us on the west coast of canada ?
what about the unwanted statues et al in the indian city ?
all emails will be promptly answered . .
peter dickinson-starkey , british columbia , canada .
kolkata still has quite few statues relating to the british raj .
maybe the big one of victoria , empress of india is too big to remove ! !
one day the indians will regret they have lost this touch with the past when the statues have withered away geoff allen , hamilton new zealand the fremont district of seattle , washington , usa , has a statue of lenin , standing amongst symbology of flames and guns , brought over from russia by a u.s. citizen who saved it from the scrap heap .
it has become a local art piece of social capital .
it is worth a drop by and a look see .
jay gorrendsun , seattle , usa i would like to dispute the following in your otherwise excellent column : 1 .
" in one terrible way , their politics have developed along similar lines -lrb- across the last half century -rrb- : dynastic leadership and hereditary power , modified by murder and assassination , as the killing of benazir bhutto has recently reminded us . "
while it is true that both indira gandhi and her son rajiv were assassinated and shastri 's death in tashkent is considered mysterious , indian political scene can not be described as something " modified by murder and assassination " .
now there are good reasons as to why india and pakistan went on to such different political trajectories , not the least of which is an early death of jinnah , and the long stable leftist statist tenure of nehru .
2 .
" like many visitors to delhi , my wife and i were taken on a tour by nigel hankin . " - obviously the phrasing " many " really is limited to posh british tourists .
3 .
your wording here seems almost too empathetic , too guileless , and too nostalgic .
" but in india as elsewhere , those who are regarded as exemplary heroes by one political regime are often derided and denounced as villains and aliens in the next ; and this is especially so when empires fall , and when dictators are vanquished . "
it seems to imply that derision is simply a function of regime change .
i know it is hard for you to believe but britain really led a deeply pernicious economic regime in india which led to the deaths of millions - yes millions - of small farmers .
by being a trading monopoly it dictated artificially low prices , mandating cultivation of indigo at expense of food crops led to repetitive starvation as money from indigo -courtesy trading was meagre , and by levying exorbitant taxes -it introduced deep impoverishment .
india was n't always as poor and it is important to keep that in mind .
secondly , the scars from the program of divide and rule are still being felt in india .
there is of course more .
while you are wonderfully empathetic to your own mortality and the statues of rapacious dictators- it would do you good to be empathetic to the untold misery of many who died with that obituary in london times .
spin , ca , usa this story took a fascinating point of view and opened up the faults of our human lust for power in the crumbling statues of the past .
his incorporation of modern day indian culture with the stories of its past show how the world is evolving and leaving the sores of history behind it .
by tying together his first person account of india to his everyday routine in england we too can find how we fit into this world of power that is forever changing and shaping the global community .
sommer ann mccullough , st. charles , il usa i lived for 9 years close to the park where the statues are .
i may add , had it not been for the paramilitary garrison camping close to the park , the remaining statues would have gone to be used as marble in the people 's houses .
david would have noticed the many empty pedestals there .
also , a tall stone monument does sit there .
perhaps it can help the kings and leaders realise that using public money for stone in monuments is better than using marble .
it might help their legacy to continue for more years and would save us ordinary folks some money .
rohitesh sharma , campbell ca us it is grotesque to equate tyrants such as stalin , lenin , saddam or hitler , responsible for the systematic extermination of close to 70 million individuals with british viceroys of india .
that your writer does so is more of a reflection of current british education , of which your writer is a product , than of historical balance .
it is the indian elite , a failed and shameless institution , that has contempt for the raj ; ordinary indians have a nuanced opinion for an age when they lived under a rule of law , were treated by respect and kindness .
so much so that 1.8 million took up arms , and sacrificed their lives , to defend the british in wwii .
it was the raj that introduced concepts of citizenship , rule of law , rulers elected by citizens and accountable to them - concepts of modernity utterly alien to pre-raj indian culture .
munawar karim , fairport , ny i suppose it is human nature to desire immortality .
many people long for this , unattainable as it is , and i know some who actually fear the thought of not being remembered once they pass on .
the usual method of signifying a great person 's life is to bury them with a tombstone commemorating how special they were to the people who knew them .
however , few people are so well-known that they become immortalised forever , and if so , they very rarely have a statue .
and those that do have a celebratory statue will certainly not have erected it themselves .
going with the india theme , mahatma gandhi has a statue commemorating his life and work .
it is placed outside his museum , and was erected by his followers and the people who loved him .
indian culture often portrays honourable figures in statue form - hinduism uses idols as a major form of constantly reminding its believers of the gods they believe in and worship .
i believe immortalisation works better through word of mouth passed from generation to generation , rather than by seeing a carved image of someone you never knew .
that kind of commemoration is neither interesting nor potent and over time it becomes a waste of space and materials .
no wonder these things get swept under the proverbial carpet .
sophie , manchester , britain interesting article .
i visited lithuania a few years ago , they have a theme park dedicated to statues of their former soviet leaders .
it is a very interesting tongue in cheek take on what to do with fallen .
in the end , those who crave immortality through the construction of statues are the ones who never really had goodwill as a principle .
they fatally seek self-aggrandisement through lifeless concrete .
immortality is achieved , not by imposition , but by conciliation and goodness and humility and simplicity .
then , and only then , can anyone perpetrate one 's legacy in the mind of people .
and to live in the heart of the beloved is not to die ...
victor osa-asemota , madrid , spain i was glad to be able to share prof david cannadine 's " point of view " in text with my family who had missed the broadcast .
thank you all .
we found his comments on ' intimations of immortality " fascinating and it reminded us of our own encounters with the changing parade of statues and monuments in zimbabwe and kenya .
we are now surfing to find a copy of " epaminondas " .
best wishes , caroline thornycroft caroline thornycroft , frome somerset uk having worked in south india over 45 years ago and travelled to many english speaking countries i have always had an interest in the " anglosphere " , and the use of the various versions of our common language and culture .
0n a visit to new delhi i obtained a copy of yule & burnell 's " hobson-jobson " 1903 -lrb- 3rd ed .
1979 -rrb- , and when i heard in 2003 that a new edition of nigel hankin 's " hanklyn-janklyn " had been printed , i ordered a copy which now sits proudly on my bookshelf alongside it 's predecessor .
this was further emphasised by dr. manmohan singh -lrb- pm of india -rrb- in his acceptance speech to the university of oxford 8th july 2005 of his honorary degree .
we have so much more to share within the " anglosphere " than toppled statues , but they too , need preserving as part of our common history .

whenever i get my hands on a copy of the newspaper that my american friends persist in calling the london times , i almost invariably turn first of all to the obituary pages and the death notices .
this is partly to satisfy myself that i 'm still here , but i do so primarily to read about the lives and careers of the recently-deceased , and to find out the age at which they actually passed on .
as i get older , this becomes an increasingly significant -lrb- and discouraging -rrb- consideration , and i suspect i 'm far from being alone in finding this to be so .
chris patten once remarked that when he read the obituary pages , he always averaged out the ages of those whose deaths were reported , and then he subtracted his own accumulated years from the figure he had calculated , so as to get a rough idea of how much time and how many years he himself had got left to go .
truly , i felt , this was the final graveyard of the british empire hear radio 4 's a point of view earlier this month , on 2 january to be precise , the times printed an obituary of a remarkable and unusual man named nigel bathurst hankin .
it was nothing like the extended treatment recently lavished on benazir bhutto or which sir edmund hillary has just received , i doubt if many readers of the times would even have heard of him , and hankin had lived most of his long life abroad , in india , where he had died last november at the age of 87 .
but i remember him vividly as i was fortunate enough to meet him about five years ago .
nigel hankin had been born in england and brought up by his grandmother in bexhill .
he had served in the british army during the second world war , and he told me that he had fought in north africa .
from there , he was transferred to india , en route to burma , in 1945 .
but the war ended before he got beyond bombay , and two years later , india was independent .
the late nigel hankin , atop of a ' baoli ' , a deep-cut well in new delhi but hankin had fallen in love with the country , and unlike many british civil servants and military men , he resolved to stay on , joining the newly-established indian army as a captain .
he later ran a mobile cinema , and then worked for the british high commission , where he would show diplomats and visitors the sights of what he would call " working delhi " , as distinct from " tourists ' delhi " .
during the 1960s , he began work on a glossary of indian english , which he eventually published in 1992 , under the far from brief title of hanklyn-janklin : a stranger 's rumble-tumble guide to some words , customs and quiddities , indian and indo-british .
here one can learn that a female educator is a " teachress " , that a young man who whistles at a woman is an " eve-teaser " , and that an " ear cleaner " is an " urban itinerant professional gentleman identified by his small red turban into which are tucked his instruments : tweezers , probes and buds of cotton wool " .
hankin who never married was fascinated by indian life , and he never considered returning to britain .
he came back in 1982 to visit his brother , but he found the place so dull that he returned to india after only three months .
when asked why his native land failed to lure him back , his reply was cryptic and revealing : he " missed the chaos " .
yet although hankin learned the local languages , and was well known in the streets and markets of " working delhi " , he never assimilated into the indian way of life , but always remained a detached -lrb- though sympathetic -rrb- observer .
although he 'd lived in the country for more than 60 years , he always breakfasted on cornflakes , eggs and bacon , which were brought to him by his devoted man servant , and his dinner invariably began with soup .
earthly power is transient , and that imperial dominion is ephemeral .
david cannadine i met nigel hankin early in 2003 , when my wife and i were visiting new delhi .
i was merely a tourist , but my wife was there to gather material for a lecture she had to deliver later that year in london , which explored the similarities and the differences between the political cultures of india and pakistan , as they had evolved since 1947 out of britain 's partitioned indian empire .
in one terrible way , their politics have developed along similar lines -lrb- across the last half century -rrb- : dynastic leadership and hereditary power , modified by murder and assassination , as the killing of benazir bhutto has recently reminded us .
but in other ways , india and pakistan are very different countries , with very different politics : in india , the military is subordinate to a thriving and disputatious democracy ; in pakistan , it is very much the other way round .
like many visitors to delhi , my wife and i were taken on a tour by nigel hankin .
he did n't bother with the obvious sights , such as the red fort or the great palace sir edwin lutyens had designed , which had once been known as viceroy 's house .
nor did we spend time navigating the wide avenues and enormous roundabouts that are so characteristic of new delhi , and which invariably remind western visitors of the layouts of paris or washington .
instead , hankin took us to the unprepossessing house where indira gandhi had lived - and died - while she was prime minister , and we even stood in the garden , on the very spot where some members of her bodyguard had struck her down .
and then we went off to delhi 's wholesale market , where we made our way through the dingy alleys and jostling crowds to the stalls where powerful herbs and eye-watering spices were being sold , and we emerged , coughing , wheezing , spluttering and most impressed , into the sunlight outside .
' we made our way to the stalls where eye-watering spices are sold ' but nigel hankin had n't done with us yet .
over lunch , i happened to mention that one of my historical interests was imperial ritual and ceremonial , and that afternoon , we were borne off to a large open space , on the edge of delhi , which had been the setting for the great durbar , or " imperial assemblage " of 1877 , when the british viceroy , lord lytton , had proclaimed queen victoria to be empress of india .
a quarter of a century later , in 1903 , lord curzon staged an even more stupendous durbar on the very same spot , to proclaim king edward vii emperor of india ; and the climax of such imperial pomp and circumstance came in december 1911 , when king george v and queen mary appeared in person to be crowned as emperor and empress - an extraordinary extravaganza that was caught on film , some of which was shown as the opening sequence of paul scott 's raj quartet , when it was televised as the jewel in the crown .
this was the place in which my wife and i now found ourselves , on a hot january afternoon , guided there by nigel hankin .
but although he showed us photographs of viceroys and ruling princes and richly caparisoned elephants , it was almost impossible to imagine that this neglected , overgrown , obscure piece of ground had once been the setting for such confident display and colourful spectaculars .
on the contrary , it conveyed the very opposite message : that earthly power is transient , and that imperial dominion is ephemeral .
and as we followed hankin , through the weeds and undergrowth , to the remotest part of the site , we came upon a most astonishing scene : a dozen immense statues , rising up from the bushes and the brambles , like the chessmen arrayed for that terrifying contest towards the end of the first harry potter film .
it took only the briefest of inspections to establish who these men were : many of them had been british viceroys , among them lord halifax and lord willingdon , and there was also a statue of the king-emperor george v himself who , like the viceroys who had represented him , was clad in full imperial fig .
originally , these statues had been placed on the traffic islands where the great avenues of new delhi had intersected , or at the end point of some appropriately grand imperial vista .
edward vii 's coronation durbar , 1903 , in delhi .
but following indian independence , these symbols of imperial rule were no longer deemed acceptable , and they were banished to this obscure and distant setting where i happened upon them : a job-lot of statues of superannuated imperial personages , forgotten , unloved and un-cared-for , whom no one in free , democratic india wanted to see any more as they drove or walked along the streets of new delhi .
truly , i felt , this was the final graveyard of the british empire .
the statues i encountered on that hot and dusty indian afternoon had been placed by the british in new delhi to be permanent monuments to men whose lives and deeds they deemed worthy of everlasting commemoration .
but in india as elsewhere , those who are regarded as exemplary heroes by one political regime are often derided and denounced as villains and aliens in the next ; and this is especially so when empires fall , and when dictators are vanquished .
following the collapse of communism in eastern europe and in russia , statues of marx and lenin were toppled and felled from their podiums , and consigned to dismembered oblivion .
and when american forces captured baghdad in april 2003 , some of the most graphic and symbolic images that made the news were of us marines and iraqis tearing down a forty foot statue of saddam hussein .
as these examples suggest , such visible forms of commemoration are no guarantee of immortality .
instead of yearning for a statue , it 's probably better to settle for an obituary in the london times .
below is a selection of your comments .
i also recall going on a fascinating visit around delhi led by nigel hankin in 1989 , at a time when i was living and working in nepal .
the tour included a visit to the site of the 1911 delhi durbar with its discarded statues including the massive statue of george v that had previously stood atop a plinth on kings way , now raj path , near new delhi 's india gate .
nigel 's analysis of the " statue graveyard " differed somewhat from the conclusions drawn by david cannadine .
whilst it 's true that the site outside delhi contains many statues , it also has many more empty plinths , prepared in expectation that unwanted statues from all over newly independent india would soon be making their way there .
however , nigel was quick to point out that many indian towns and cities actually felt rather affectionately disposed towards their rather bombastic imperial relics and were reluctant to be relieved of them .
hence the empty plinths in new delhi , and the numerous imperial statues that remain in their original locations around india .
gareth wardell , selby , north yorkshire , uk .
what a fascinating article .
it reminded me of one of my highlights of budapest - their fabulous statue park , where astride a hill above the city all the former soviet statues are collected .
period music plays and you are free to sit on the feet of stalin .
the best bit has to be the housing estate around the park - what an eerie way to wake up , draw the curtains and look out on lenin saluting you .
vicki , london , uk i met nigel hankin on a trip to delhi in 1999 .
he was a very special person who brought delhi alive .
once off the tourist trail india is an intriguing place you have to go back again and again .
nigel 's tour into the old delhi markets was the catalyst for me .
bob pritchard , brockham surrey the sight of a statue of lord willingdon would look well here in north burnaby where a main street is willingdon avenue , and is about to be widened in 2008 .
is the actual statue available / transported to us on the west coast of canada ?
what about the unwanted statues et al in the indian city ?
all emails will be promptly answered . .
peter dickinson-starkey , british columbia , canada .
kolkata still has quite few statues relating to the british raj .
maybe the big one of victoria , empress of india is too big to remove ! !
one day the indians will regret they have lost this touch with the past when the statues have withered away geoff allen , hamilton new zealand the fremont district of seattle , washington , usa , has a statue of lenin , standing amongst symbology of flames and guns , brought over from russia by a u.s. citizen who saved it from the scrap heap .
it has become a local art piece of social capital .
it is worth a drop by and a look see .
jay gorrendsun , seattle , usa i would like to dispute the following in your otherwise excellent column : 1 .
" in one terrible way , their politics have developed along similar lines -lrb- across the last half century -rrb- : dynastic leadership and hereditary power , modified by murder and assassination , as the killing of benazir bhutto has recently reminded us . "
while it is true that both indira gandhi and her son rajiv were assassinated and shastri 's death in tashkent is considered mysterious , indian political scene can not be described as something " modified by murder and assassination " .
now there are good reasons as to why india and pakistan went on to such different political trajectories , not the least of which is an early death of jinnah , and the long stable leftist statist tenure of nehru .
2 .
" like many visitors to delhi , my wife and i were taken on a tour by nigel hankin . " - obviously the phrasing " many " really is limited to posh british tourists .
3 .
your wording here seems almost too empathetic , too guileless , and too nostalgic .
" but in india as elsewhere , those who are regarded as exemplary heroes by one political regime are often derided and denounced as villains and aliens in the next ; and this is especially so when empires fall , and when dictators are vanquished . "
it seems to imply that derision is simply a function of regime change .
i know it is hard for you to believe but britain really led a deeply pernicious economic regime in india which led to the deaths of millions - yes millions - of small farmers .
by being a trading monopoly it dictated artificially low prices , mandating cultivation of indigo at expense of food crops led to repetitive starvation as money from indigo -courtesy trading was meagre , and by levying exorbitant taxes -it introduced deep impoverishment .
india was n't always as poor and it is important to keep that in mind .
secondly , the scars from the program of divide and rule are still being felt in india .
there is of course more .
while you are wonderfully empathetic to your own mortality and the statues of rapacious dictators- it would do you good to be empathetic to the untold misery of many who died with that obituary in london times .
spin , ca , usa this story took a fascinating point of view and opened up the faults of our human lust for power in the crumbling statues of the past .
his incorporation of modern day indian culture with the stories of its past show how the world is evolving and leaving the sores of history behind it .
by tying together his first person account of india to his everyday routine in england we too can find how we fit into this world of power that is forever changing and shaping the global community .
sommer ann mccullough , st. charles , il usa i lived for 9 years close to the park where the statues are .
i may add , had it not been for the paramilitary garrison camping close to the park , the remaining statues would have gone to be used as marble in the people 's houses .
david would have noticed the many empty pedestals there .
also , a tall stone monument does sit there .
perhaps it can help the kings and leaders realise that using public money for stone in monuments is better than using marble .
it might help their legacy to continue for more years and would save us ordinary folks some money .
rohitesh sharma , campbell ca us it is grotesque to equate tyrants such as stalin , lenin , saddam or hitler , responsible for the systematic extermination of close to 70 million individuals with british viceroys of india .
that your writer does so is more of a reflection of current british education , of which your writer is a product , than of historical balance .
it is the indian elite , a failed and shameless institution , that has contempt for the raj ; ordinary indians have a nuanced opinion for an age when they lived under a rule of law , were treated by respect and kindness .
so much so that 1.8 million took up arms , and sacrificed their lives , to defend the british in wwii .
it was the raj that introduced concepts of citizenship , rule of law , rulers elected by citizens and accountable to them - concepts of modernity utterly alien to pre-raj indian culture .
munawar karim , fairport , ny i suppose it is human nature to desire immortality .
many people long for this , unattainable as it is , and i know some who actually fear the thought of not being remembered once they pass on .
the usual method of signifying a great person 's life is to bury them with a tombstone commemorating how special they were to the people who knew them .
however , few people are so well-known that they become immortalised forever , and if so , they very rarely have a statue .
and those that do have a celebratory statue will certainly not have erected it themselves .
going with the india theme , mahatma gandhi has a statue commemorating his life and work .
it is placed outside his museum , and was erected by his followers and the people who loved him .
indian culture often portrays honourable figures in statue form - hinduism uses idols as a major form of constantly reminding its believers of the gods they believe in and worship .
i believe immortalisation works better through word of mouth passed from generation to generation , rather than by seeing a carved image of someone you never knew .
that kind of commemoration is neither interesting nor potent and over time it becomes a waste of space and materials .
no wonder these things get swept under the proverbial carpet .
sophie , manchester , britain interesting article .
i visited lithuania a few years ago , they have a theme park dedicated to statues of their former soviet leaders .
it is a very interesting tongue in cheek take on what to do with fallen .
in the end , those who crave immortality through the construction of statues are the ones who never really had goodwill as a principle .
they fatally seek self-aggrandisement through lifeless concrete .
immortality is achieved , not by imposition , but by conciliation and goodness and humility and simplicity .
then , and only then , can anyone perpetrate one 's legacy in the mind of people .
and to live in the heart of the beloved is not to die ...

i also recall going on a fascinating visit around delhi led by nigel hankin in 1989 , at a time when i was living and working in nepal .
the tour included a visit to the site of the 1911 delhi durbar with its discarded statues including the massive statue of george v that had previously stood atop a plinth on kings way , now raj path , near new delhi 's india gate .
nigel 's analysis of the " statue graveyard " differed somewhat from the conclusions drawn by david cannadine .
whilst it 's true that the site outside delhi contains many statues , it also has many more empty plinths , prepared in expectation that unwanted statues from all over newly independent india would soon be making their way there .
however , nigel was quick to point out that many indian towns and cities actually felt rather affectionately disposed towards their rather bombastic imperial relics and were reluctant to be relieved of them .
hence the empty plinths in new delhi , and the numerous imperial statues that remain in their original locations around india .

he was a very special person who brought delhi alive .
once off the tourist trail india is an intriguing place you have to go back again and again .
nigel 's tour into the old delhi markets was the catalyst for me .

jay gorrendsun , seattle , usa i would like to dispute the following in your otherwise excellent column : 1 .
" in one terrible way , their politics have developed along similar lines -lrb- across the last half century -rrb- : dynastic leadership and hereditary power , modified by murder and assassination , as the killing of benazir bhutto has recently reminded us . "
while it is true that both indira gandhi and her son rajiv were assassinated and shastri 's death in tashkent is considered mysterious , indian political scene can not be described as something " modified by murder and assassination " .
now there are good reasons as to why india and pakistan went on to such different political trajectories , not the least of which is an early death of jinnah , and the long stable leftist statist tenure of nehru .
2 .
" like many visitors to delhi , my wife and i were taken on a tour by nigel hankin . " - obviously the phrasing " many " really is limited to posh british tourists .
3 .
your wording here seems almost too empathetic , too guileless , and too nostalgic .
" but in india as elsewhere , those who are regarded as exemplary heroes by one political regime are often derided and denounced as villains and aliens in the next ; and this is especially so when empires fall , and when dictators are vanquished . "
it seems to imply that derision is simply a function of regime change .
i know it is hard for you to believe but britain really led a deeply pernicious economic regime in india which led to the deaths of millions - yes millions - of small farmers .
by being a trading monopoly it dictated artificially low prices , mandating cultivation of indigo at expense of food crops led to repetitive starvation as money from indigo -courtesy trading was meagre , and by levying exorbitant taxes -it introduced deep impoverishment .
india was n't always as poor and it is important to keep that in mind .
secondly , the scars from the program of divide and rule are still being felt in india .
there is of course more .
while you are wonderfully empathetic to your own mortality and the statues of rapacious dictators- it would do you good to be empathetic to the untold misery of many who died with that obituary in london times .
spin , ca , usa this story took a fascinating point of view and opened up the faults of our human lust for power in the crumbling statues of the past .
his incorporation of modern day indian culture with the stories of its past show how the world is evolving and leaving the sores of history behind it .
by tying together his first person account of india to his everyday routine in england we too can find how we fit into this world of power that is forever changing and shaping the global community .
sommer ann mccullough , st. charles , il usa i lived for 9 years close to the park where the statues are .
i may add , had it not been for the paramilitary garrison camping close to the park , the remaining statues would have gone to be used as marble in the people 's houses .
david would have noticed the many empty pedestals there .
also , a tall stone monument does sit there .
perhaps it can help the kings and leaders realise that using public money for stone in monuments is better than using marble .
it might help their legacy to continue for more years and would save us ordinary folks some money .
rohitesh sharma , campbell ca us it is grotesque to equate tyrants such as stalin , lenin , saddam or hitler , responsible for the systematic extermination of close to 70 million individuals with british viceroys of india .
that your writer does so is more of a reflection of current british education , of which your writer is a product , than of historical balance .
it is the indian elite , a failed and shameless institution , that has contempt for the raj ; ordinary indians have a nuanced opinion for an age when they lived under a rule of law , were treated by respect and kindness .
so much so that 1.8 million took up arms , and sacrificed their lives , to defend the british in wwii .
it was the raj that introduced concepts of citizenship , rule of law , rulers elected by citizens and accountable to them - concepts of modernity utterly alien to pre-raj indian culture .
munawar karim , fairport , ny i suppose it is human nature to desire immortality .
many people long for this , unattainable as it is , and i know some who actually fear the thought of not being remembered once they pass on .
the usual method of signifying a great person 's life is to bury them with a tombstone commemorating how special they were to the people who knew them .
however , few people are so well-known that they become immortalised forever , and if so , they very rarely have a statue .
and those that do have a celebratory statue will certainly not have erected it themselves .
going with the india theme , mahatma gandhi has a statue commemorating his life and work .
it is placed outside his museum , and was erected by his followers and the people who loved him .
indian culture often portrays honourable figures in statue form - hinduism uses idols as a major form of constantly reminding its believers of the gods they believe in and worship .
i believe immortalisation works better through word of mouth passed from generation to generation , rather than by seeing a carved image of someone you never knew .
that kind of commemoration is neither interesting nor potent and over time it becomes a waste of space and materials .
no wonder these things get swept under the proverbial carpet .
sophie , manchester , britain interesting article .
i visited lithuania a few years ago , they have a theme park dedicated to statues of their former soviet leaders .
it is a very interesting tongue in cheek take on what to do with fallen .
in the end , those who crave immortality through the construction of statues are the ones who never really had goodwill as a principle .
they fatally seek self-aggrandisement through lifeless concrete .
immortality is achieved , not by imposition , but by conciliation and goodness and humility and simplicity .
then , and only then , can anyone perpetrate one 's legacy in the mind of people .
and to live in the heart of the beloved is not to die ...

but those regarded as heroes by one political regime are often denounced as villains by the next , their statues left unloved or toppled and carted off to the wilderness .
whenever i get my hands on a copy of the newspaper that my american friends persist in calling the london times , i almost invariably turn first of all to the obituary pages and the death notices .
this is partly to satisfy myself that i 'm still here , but i do so primarily to read about the lives and careers of the recently-deceased , and to find out the age at which they actually passed on .
as i get older , this becomes an increasingly significant -lrb- and discouraging -rrb- consideration , and i suspect i 'm far from being alone in finding this to be so .
chris patten once remarked that when he read the obituary pages , he always averaged out the ages of those whose deaths were reported , and then he subtracted his own accumulated years from the figure he had calculated , so as to get a rough idea of how much time and how many years he himself had got left to go .
truly , i felt , this was the final graveyard of the british empire hear radio 4 's a point of view earlier this month , on 2 january to be precise , the times printed an obituary of a remarkable and unusual man named nigel bathurst hankin .
it was nothing like the extended treatment recently lavished on benazir bhutto or which sir edmund hillary has just received , i doubt if many readers of the times would even have heard of him , and hankin had lived most of his long life abroad , in india , where he had died last november at the age of 87 .
but i remember him vividly as i was fortunate enough to meet him about five years ago .
nigel hankin had been born in england and brought up by his grandmother in bexhill .
he had served in the british army during the second world war , and he told me that he had fought in north africa .
from there , he was transferred to india , en route to burma , in 1945 .
but the war ended before he got beyond bombay , and two years later , india was independent .
the late nigel hankin , atop of a ' baoli ' , a deep-cut well in new delhi but hankin had fallen in love with the country , and unlike many british civil servants and military men , he resolved to stay on , joining the newly-established indian army as a captain .
he later ran a mobile cinema , and then worked for the british high commission , where he would show diplomats and visitors the sights of what he would call " working delhi " , as distinct from " tourists ' delhi " .
during the 1960s , he began work on a glossary of indian english , which he eventually published in 1992 , under the far from brief title of hanklyn-janklin : a stranger 's rumble-tumble guide to some words , customs and quiddities , indian and indo-british .
here one can learn that a female educator is a " teachress " , that a young man who whistles at a woman is an " eve-teaser " , and that an " ear cleaner " is an " urban itinerant professional gentleman identified by his small red turban into which are tucked his instruments : tweezers , probes and buds of cotton wool " .
hankin who never married was fascinated by indian life , and he never considered returning to britain .
he came back in 1982 to visit his brother , but he found the place so dull that he returned to india after only three months .
when asked why his native land failed to lure him back , his reply was cryptic and revealing : he " missed the chaos " .
yet although hankin learned the local languages , and was well known in the streets and markets of " working delhi " , he never assimilated into the indian way of life , but always remained a detached -lrb- though sympathetic -rrb- observer .
although he 'd lived in the country for more than 60 years , he always breakfasted on cornflakes , eggs and bacon , which were brought to him by his devoted man servant , and his dinner invariably began with soup .
earthly power is transient , and that imperial dominion is ephemeral .
david cannadine i met nigel hankin early in 2003 , when my wife and i were visiting new delhi .
i was merely a tourist , but my wife was there to gather material for a lecture she had to deliver later that year in london , which explored the similarities and the differences between the political cultures of india and pakistan , as they had evolved since 1947 out of britain 's partitioned indian empire .
in one terrible way , their politics have developed along similar lines -lrb- across the last half century -rrb- : dynastic leadership and hereditary power , modified by murder and assassination , as the killing of benazir bhutto has recently reminded us .
but in other ways , india and pakistan are very different countries , with very different politics : in india , the military is subordinate to a thriving and disputatious democracy ; in pakistan , it is very much the other way round .
like many visitors to delhi , my wife and i were taken on a tour by nigel hankin .
he did n't bother with the obvious sights , such as the red fort or the great palace sir edwin lutyens had designed , which had once been known as viceroy 's house .
nor did we spend time navigating the wide avenues and enormous roundabouts that are so characteristic of new delhi , and which invariably remind western visitors of the layouts of paris or washington .
instead , hankin took us to the unprepossessing house where indira gandhi had lived - and died - while she was prime minister , and we even stood in the garden , on the very spot where some members of her bodyguard had struck her down .
and then we went off to delhi 's wholesale market , where we made our way through the dingy alleys and jostling crowds to the stalls where powerful herbs and eye-watering spices were being sold , and we emerged , coughing , wheezing , spluttering and most impressed , into the sunlight outside .
' we made our way to the stalls where eye-watering spices are sold ' but nigel hankin had n't done with us yet .
over lunch , i happened to mention that one of my historical interests was imperial ritual and ceremonial , and that afternoon , we were borne off to a large open space , on the edge of delhi , which had been the setting for the great durbar , or " imperial assemblage " of 1877 , when the british viceroy , lord lytton , had proclaimed queen victoria to be empress of india .
a quarter of a century later , in 1903 , lord curzon staged an even more stupendous durbar on the very same spot , to proclaim king edward vii emperor of india ; and the climax of such imperial pomp and circumstance came in december 1911 , when king george v and queen mary appeared in person to be crowned as emperor and empress - an extraordinary extravaganza that was caught on film , some of which was shown as the opening sequence of paul scott 's raj quartet , when it was televised as the jewel in the crown .
this was the place in which my wife and i now found ourselves , on a hot january afternoon , guided there by nigel hankin .
but although he showed us photographs of viceroys and ruling princes and richly caparisoned elephants , it was almost impossible to imagine that this neglected , overgrown , obscure piece of ground had once been the setting for such confident display and colourful spectaculars .
on the contrary , it conveyed the very opposite message : that earthly power is transient , and that imperial dominion is ephemeral .
and as we followed hankin , through the weeds and undergrowth , to the remotest part of the site , we came upon a most astonishing scene : a dozen immense statues , rising up from the bushes and the brambles , like the chessmen arrayed for that terrifying contest towards the end of the first harry potter film .
it took only the briefest of inspections to establish who these men were : many of them had been british viceroys , among them lord halifax and lord willingdon , and there was also a statue of the king-emperor george v himself who , like the viceroys who had represented him , was clad in full imperial fig .
originally , these statues had been placed on the traffic islands where the great avenues of new delhi had intersected , or at the end point of some appropriately grand imperial vista .
edward vii 's coronation durbar , 1903 , in delhi .
but following indian independence , these symbols of imperial rule were no longer deemed acceptable , and they were banished to this obscure and distant setting where i happened upon them : a job-lot of statues of superannuated imperial personages , forgotten , unloved and un-cared-for , whom no one in free , democratic india wanted to see any more as they drove or walked along the streets of new delhi .
truly , i felt , this was the final graveyard of the british empire .
the statues i encountered on that hot and dusty indian afternoon had been placed by the british in new delhi to be permanent monuments to men whose lives and deeds they deemed worthy of everlasting commemoration .
but in india as elsewhere , those who are regarded as exemplary heroes by one political regime are often derided and denounced as villains and aliens in the next ; and this is especially so when empires fall , and when dictators are vanquished .
following the collapse of communism in eastern europe and in russia , statues of marx and lenin were toppled and felled from their podiums , and consigned to dismembered oblivion .
and when american forces captured baghdad in april 2003 , some of the most graphic and symbolic images that made the news were of us marines and iraqis tearing down a forty foot statue of saddam hussein .
as these examples suggest , such visible forms of commemoration are no guarantee of immortality .
instead of yearning for a statue , it 's probably better to settle for an obituary in the london times .
