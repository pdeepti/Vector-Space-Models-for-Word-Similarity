minutes before a tv special on the eu presidency is due to begin recording , the closing titles are being typed up , the opening music has been mislaid and a guest from the serbian capital , belgrade , has failed to turn up .
slovenia inherits the presidency from portugal on 1 january .
waiting patiently in the studio is jelco kacin , slovenian member of the european parliament and " rapporteur " for serbia .
eventually the guest in belgrade turns up , the titles are typed in and the music , well , that can be put in later .
focus on kosovo the future of kosovo is the focus of the programme and will be the focus of slovenia 's presidency .
the breakaway serbian province , which has been under united nations administration for the past seven years , is universally expected to declare independence some time in the next couple of months .
profile : slovenia slovenia 's job as holder of the presidency will be to guide and co-ordinate the eu 's response .
" we want to make the western balkans stable and predictable , maybe even boring , " says mr kacin .
" that 's why we would like to fill the gap between ljubljana and thessaloniki -lsb- in greece -rsb- with member states . "
and slovenia ?
is that boring , i wonder ?
" since we are taking over the presidency in a few weeks i believe that we are boring enough that everybody is recognising slovenia as a boring , predictable state . "
as he says it , he almost comes close to cracking what looks like a smile .
spotlessly clean ljubljana , slovenia 's capital , is , as everyone who has visited says , very beautiful .
the streets are spotlessly clean .
prosperous slovenes sip coffees in the charming central square under the shadow of well-preserved churches .
at night fairy lights strung from trees and around buildings make it look as if a hollywood director has created the perfect christmas town .
but ljubljana has also reached the state that mr kacin wants for the balkans : it is very boring .
every country uses the eu presidency to double as a shop window - a way of advertising itself to the rest of the eu and beyond .
the french are reported to be spending more than 1m euros -lrb- £ 750,000 -rrb- a day on their presidency .
big opportunity the smaller the country , the greater the opportunity .
so for tiny slovenia -lrb- it 's around half the size of switzerland -rrb- the opportunity is a big one .
one of the exhibitions it is sponsoring in brussels will be of the work of joze plecnik , the architect who transformed ljubjlana and whom nobody outside slovenia appears to have heard of .
as he walks along the capital 's charming plecnik-designed riverside , andrej hravsky , the president of the slovenian architectural association , enthuses about both plecnik and all things european .
slovenia already uses the euro - " which you british do not appear to be keen on " - and has just scrapped borders with other eu members , joining what is known as the schengen group .
but it will have to beef up the border with another one-time member of the yugoslav federation , croatia , which is outside the eu .
" we did n't know where the border with croatia was , " he says .
" but we always knew where the border was with italy , because that was the border between east and west .
now the border is gone .
history is being reversed . "
it is not the only historical reversal .
running the show holding the presidency of the eu does not mean slovenia gets to tell other eu members , or the commission , what to do .
but the presidency does get a chance to guide and co-ordinate the eu 's work .
two years ago , britain focused its energy on starting membership talks with turkey .
last year , germany resolved to complete negotiations on the reform treaty .
expect nothing quite so ambitious from slovenia .
talk to a brussels-based slovenian diplomat and there is more than a hint of blind terror at the trials to come .
the talk is not so much of which grand project will be pursued as of how to ensure that nothing goes horribly wrong .
but it is worth pondering : for centuries slovenia was nothing more than a province of the austro-hungarian empire , then a very junior partner in a serb-dominated kingdom which then became a federation .
now , with a little help from its friends , it gets to run the whole eu circus .
dull old europe still throws up a trick or two .

minutes before a tv special on the eu presidency is due to begin recording , the closing titles are being typed up , the opening music has been mislaid and a guest from the serbian capital , belgrade , has failed to turn up .
slovenia inherits the presidency from portugal on 1 january .
waiting patiently in the studio is jelco kacin , slovenian member of the european parliament and " rapporteur " for serbia .
eventually the guest in belgrade turns up , the titles are typed in and the music , well , that can be put in later .
focus on kosovo the future of kosovo is the focus of the programme and will be the focus of slovenia 's presidency .
the breakaway serbian province , which has been under united nations administration for the past seven years , is universally expected to declare independence some time in the next couple of months .
profile : slovenia slovenia 's job as holder of the presidency will be to guide and co-ordinate the eu 's response .
" we want to make the western balkans stable and predictable , maybe even boring , " says mr kacin .
" that 's why we would like to fill the gap between ljubljana and thessaloniki -lsb- in greece -rsb- with member states . "
and slovenia ?
is that boring , i wonder ?
" since we are taking over the presidency in a few weeks i believe that we are boring enough that everybody is recognising slovenia as a boring , predictable state . "
as he says it , he almost comes close to cracking what looks like a smile .
spotlessly clean ljubljana , slovenia 's capital , is , as everyone who has visited says , very beautiful .
slovenia 's capital ljubljana is prosperous and beautiful the streets are spotlessly clean .
prosperous slovenes sip coffees in the charming central square under the shadow of well-preserved churches .
at night fairy lights strung from trees and around buildings make it look as if a hollywood director has created the perfect christmas town .
but ljubljana has also reached the state that mr kacin wants for the balkans : it is very boring .
every country uses the eu presidency to double as a shop window - a way of advertising itself to the rest of the eu and beyond .
the french are reported to be spending more than 1m euros -lrb- £ 750,000 -rrb- a day on their presidency .
big opportunity the smaller the country , the greater the opportunity .
a couple celebrate the scrapping of slovenia 's border controls with italy so for tiny slovenia -lrb- it 's around half the size of switzerland -rrb- the opportunity is a big one .
one of the exhibitions it is sponsoring in brussels will be of the work of joze plecnik , the architect who transformed ljubjlana and whom nobody outside slovenia appears to have heard of .
as he walks along the capital 's charming plecnik-designed riverside , andrej hravsky , the president of the slovenian architectural association , enthuses about both plecnik and all things european .
slovenia already uses the euro - " which you british do not appear to be keen on " - and has just scrapped borders with other eu members , joining what is known as the schengen group .
but it will have to beef up the border with another one-time member of the yugoslav federation , croatia , which is outside the eu .
" we did n't know where the border with croatia was , " he says .
" but we always knew where the border was with italy , because that was the border between east and west .
now the border is gone .
history is being reversed . "
it is not the only historical reversal .
running the show holding the presidency of the eu does not mean slovenia gets to tell other eu members , or the commission , what to do .
but the presidency does get a chance to guide and co-ordinate the eu 's work .
two years ago , britain focused its energy on starting membership talks with turkey .
last year , germany resolved to complete negotiations on the reform treaty .
expect nothing quite so ambitious from slovenia .
talk to a brussels-based slovenian diplomat and there is more than a hint of blind terror at the trials to come .
the talk is not so much of which grand project will be pursued as of how to ensure that nothing goes horribly wrong .
but it is worth pondering : for centuries slovenia was nothing more than a province of the austro-hungarian empire , then a very junior partner in a serb-dominated kingdom which then became a federation .
now , with a little help from its friends , it gets to run the whole eu circus .
dull old europe still throws up a trick or two .
