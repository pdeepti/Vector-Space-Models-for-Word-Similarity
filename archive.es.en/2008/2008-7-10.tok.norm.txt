" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .
lawmakers complained that government contracts should not be filled abroad at a of growing us unemployment . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2008 france 's glamorous first lady releases new album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has vowed to continue with her songstress career despite her marriage to sarkozy after weeks of hype and breathless anticipation , carla bruni-sarkozy 's new album , offered free online this week , hits stores in france and much of europe friday , june 11 .
critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would n't pass the test , say critics " it 's a stupid question and the answer is even more stupid , " the organization 's spokesman ulrich ropertz told the ap news agency .
the catalogue of questions encompasses a total of 310 questions on german institutions and society .
to pass , 17 of 33 questions need to be answered correctly .
too many obstacles according to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the recent drop in the number of people gaining german citizenship indicated that applicants face too many hurdles . in 2007 , 113,000 would-be germans gained citizenship , 9.5 percent fewer than the year before .
" germany does not have the sort of atmosphere that makes immigrants feel welcome , " said annelie buntenbach from the dgb . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.07.2008 halal , kosher slaughter unacceptable , say german vets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : halal butchers argue that animals are not distressed when they are slaughtered muslim and jewish groups are angered by a call from germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians for a law re-establishing protection against slaughter without stunning . germany 's main jewish group rejected wednesday , july 10 , the latest criticism of kosher slaughter practices , and was immediately backed by a turkish group in germany speaking on behalf of muslims .
both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .
encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .
but in 2002 , it re-established the right for german butchers to slaughter animals according to islamic religious ritual in a case brought by a turkish butcher from giessen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .
encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .
but in 2002 , it re-established the right for german butchers to slaughter animals according to islamic religious ritual in a case brought by a turkish butcher from giessen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2008 germany 's economy could succumb to global uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global slow-down means german sales abroad are down the latest numbers are n't all bad , but some are bad enough to have experts fretting that germany could be slipping toward recession .
could germany become the victim of a global trend ? perhaps the most alarming statistic published on wednesday , july 9 , concerned exports .
they fell by a seasonally adjusted 3.2 percent in may , the biggest fall in four years .
economists had expected a mere 0.5 percent drop .
" yes , we are losing momentum , " rainer guntermann , senior economist with dresdner kleinwort in frankfurt , told the dpa news agency .
" german exports are at risk of coming off the boil . "
the problem , experts say , is the economic weakness of countries to which germany exports its products .
" the best times for exports are over , " commerzbank analyst matthias rubisch told the afp news agency .
" in western europe in particular , the main destination for german exports , the economy has suffered a serious setback . "
germany 's trade surplus also dropped from 18.8 billion to 14.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 29.2 billion to $ 22.6 billion -rrb- from april to may .
eroding faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall industrial production is also faltering factory orders and industrial production also suffered sharp monthly falls , and that ate away at business confidence .
the munich based economic research organization said that economic confidence had dropped to 101.3 in june - one index point lower than predicted .
retail sales are expected to decline one percent this year as inflation , driven by high oil prices , has undermined disposable consumer income .
meanwhile , bankruptcies in germany rose 6.2 percent in april .
silver linings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but lines at unemployment offices are slightly shorter but there was some positive news amidst the gloom .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the german economy as a whole to grow by 2.25 percent .

could germany become the victim of a global trend ? perhaps the most alarming statistic published on wednesday , july 9 , concerned exports .
they fell by a seasonally adjusted 3.2 percent in may , the biggest fall in four years .
economists had expected a mere 0.5 percent drop .
" yes , we are losing momentum , " rainer guntermann , senior economist with dresdner kleinwort in frankfurt , told the dpa news agency .
" german exports are at risk of coming off the boil . "
the problem , experts say , is the economic weakness of countries to which germany exports its products .
" the best times for exports are over , " commerzbank analyst matthias rubisch told the afp news agency .
" in western europe in particular , the main destination for german exports , the economy has suffered a serious setback . "
germany 's trade surplus also dropped from 18.8 billion to 14.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 29.2 billion to $ 22.6 billion -rrb- from april to may .
eroding faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall industrial production is also faltering factory orders and industrial production also suffered sharp monthly falls , and that ate away at business confidence .
the munich based economic research organization said that economic confidence had dropped to 101.3 in june - one index point lower than predicted .
retail sales are expected to decline one percent this year as inflation , driven by high oil prices , has undermined disposable consumer income .
meanwhile , bankruptcies in germany rose 6.2 percent in april .
silver linings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but lines at unemployment offices are slightly shorter but there was some positive news amidst the gloom .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , expects the german economy as a whole to grow by 2.25 percent .
that 's less than the 2.5 growth enjoyed in 2007 , but up from previous predictions of 1.9 percent for 2008 .
unemployment also fell to by 0.1 percent in june to 7.8 percent - the lowest rate in sixteen years .
however , siemens announced it was firing about 4 percent of its global employees , some 16,750 in number , while detergent maker henkel said it would cut 3000 jobs world-wide .

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "

encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .
but in 2002 , it re-established the right for german butchers to slaughter animals according to islamic religious ritual in a case brought by a turkish butcher from giessen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .

in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall .

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .
the united states is quite different , with 57 percent of young adults praying daily , the survey found . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2008 france 's glamorous first lady releases new album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has vowed to continue with her songstress career despite her marriage to sarkozy after weeks of hype and breathless anticipation , carla bruni-sarkozy 's new album , offered free online this week , hits stores in france and much of europe friday , june 11 .
critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2008 france 's glamorous first lady releases new album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has vowed to continue with her songstress career despite her marriage to sarkozy after weeks of hype and breathless anticipation , carla bruni-sarkozy 's new album , offered free online this week , hits stores in france and much of europe friday , june 11 .
critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy 's announcement met with widespread indignation in the european assembly , with meps accusing him of letting down european union efforts to pressure china on civil rights and tibet .
france currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member bloc .
" europe has capitulated ...
europe should keep mr. sarkozy away from beijing , " parliament vice-president edward mcmillan-scott told the european parliament in strasbourg .
accusations of hypocrisy green party floor leader daniel cohn-bendit accused sarkozy of hypocrisy and exposing europe to " humiliation , " reported reuters news agency .
" it is scandalous that he is not prepared to boycott the ceremony , " he said , maintaining that the french leader prioritizes business interests before human rights .
however , french europe minister jean-pierre jouyet defended his president 's decision and said the eu " should think twice before teaching the rest of the world about morals . "
lack of progress poettering , meanwhile , steered clear of any reference to sarkozy and merely cited a " lack of progress " in talks between china and representatives of tibetan leader dalai lama for his decision not to travel to china for the aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.07.2008 eu parliament raises bar for extremist parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller parties now have less of a chance to form in the european parliament the european parliament has tightened the rules on forming political groups in the assembly .
critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .
many deputies were outraged that the group had been able to form in the first place . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .

" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "

the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .

in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

could germany become the victim of a global trend ? perhaps the most alarming statistic published on wednesday , july 9 , concerned exports .
they fell by a seasonally adjusted 3.2 percent in may , the biggest fall in four years .
economists had expected a mere 0.5 percent drop .
" yes , we are losing momentum , " rainer guntermann , senior economist with dresdner kleinwort in frankfurt , told the dpa news agency .
" german exports are at risk of coming off the boil . "
the problem , experts say , is the economic weakness of countries to which germany exports its products .
" the best times for exports are over , " commerzbank analyst matthias rubisch told the afp news agency .
" in western europe in particular , the main destination for german exports , the economy has suffered a serious setback . "
germany 's trade surplus also dropped from 18.8 billion to 14.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 29.2 billion to $ 22.6 billion -rrb- from april to may .

retail sales are expected to decline one percent this year as inflation , driven by high oil prices , has undermined disposable consumer income .
meanwhile , bankruptcies in germany rose 6.2 percent in april .

that 's less than the 2.5 growth enjoyed in 2007 , but up from previous predictions of 1.9 percent for 2008 .
unemployment also fell to by 0.1 percent in june to 7.8 percent - the lowest rate in sixteen years .
however , siemens announced it was firing about 4 percent of its global employees , some 16,750 in number , while detergent maker henkel said it would cut 3000 jobs world-wide .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq . " georgia 's geographic location also allows other allies and partners in the region to see the benefits of working with the united states , " it said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq . " georgia 's geographic location also allows other allies and partners in the region to see the benefits of working with the united states , " it said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .
lawmakers complained that government contracts should not be filled abroad at a of growing us unemployment . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .
the united states is quite different , with 57 percent of young adults praying daily , the survey found . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .
encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .
but in 2002 , it re-established the right for german butchers to slaughter animals according to islamic religious ritual in a case brought by a turkish butcher from giessen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .

however , french europe minister jean-pierre jouyet defended his president 's decision and said the eu " should think twice before teaching the rest of the world about morals . "

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq . " georgia 's geographic location also allows other allies and partners in the region to see the benefits of working with the united states , " it said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma street child on the streets of the albanian capital tirana a recent study by the european commission on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .
in 1987 , then us president ronald reagan mad a famous appearance in front of the landmark , which was still cut off by the wall at that time .
in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall . " former us president bill clinton also appeared at the gate in 1994 , ending his speech with the words " berlin ist frei , " or " berlin is free . " the last former us president to speak in front of the gate was george bush , sr. , who inaugurated the new us embassy , which sits next to the gate , on july 4 , 2008 . us president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech on the other hand took place at schoeneberg city hall , which was the seat of the berlin mayor before the reunification of the city . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .
in 1987 , then us president ronald reagan mad a famous appearance in front of the landmark , which was still cut off by the wall at that time .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .
in 1987 , then us president ronald reagan mad a famous appearance in front of the landmark , which was still cut off by the wall at that time .
in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall . " former us president bill clinton also appeared at the gate in 1994 , ending his speech with the words " berlin ist frei , " or " berlin is free .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .

while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .

" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .
many deputies were outraged that the group had been able to form in the first place . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .

schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .

the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .

sarkozy 's announcement met with widespread indignation in the european assembly , with meps accusing him of letting down european union efforts to pressure china on civil rights and tibet .
france currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member bloc .
" europe has capitulated ...
europe should keep mr. sarkozy away from beijing , " parliament vice-president edward mcmillan-scott told the european parliament in strasbourg .
accusations of hypocrisy green party floor leader daniel cohn-bendit accused sarkozy of hypocrisy and exposing europe to " humiliation , " reported reuters news agency .
" it is scandalous that he is not prepared to boycott the ceremony , " he said , maintaining that the french leader prioritizes business interests before human rights .
however , french europe minister jean-pierre jouyet defended his president 's decision and said the eu " should think twice before teaching the rest of the world about morals . "
lack of progress poettering , meanwhile , steered clear of any reference to sarkozy and merely cited a " lack of progress " in talks between china and representatives of tibetan leader dalai lama for his decision not to travel to china for the aug .

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation .

" tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed .

" russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .

while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .

the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .
the united states is quite different , with 57 percent of young adults praying daily , the survey found . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .
the united states is quite different , with 57 percent of young adults praying daily , the survey found . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .
in 1987 , then us president ronald reagan mad a famous appearance in front of the landmark , which was still cut off by the wall at that time .
in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall . " former us president bill clinton also appeared at the gate in 1994 , ending his speech with the words " berlin ist frei , " or " berlin is free . " the last former us president to speak in front of the gate was george bush , sr. , who inaugurated the new us embassy , which sits next to the gate , on july 4 , 2008 . us president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech on the other hand took place at schoeneberg city hall , which was the seat of the berlin mayor before the reunification of the city . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation .

" hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity .

russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed .

" russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .

in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall . " former us president bill clinton also appeared at the gate in 1994 , ending his speech with the words " berlin ist frei , " or " berlin is free . " the last former us president to speak in front of the gate was george bush , sr. , who inaugurated the new us embassy , which sits next to the gate , on july 4 , 2008 . us president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech on the other hand took place at schoeneberg city hall , which was the seat of the berlin mayor before the reunification of the city . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq . " georgia 's geographic location also allows other allies and partners in the region to see the benefits of working with the united states , " it said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .

in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall . " former us president bill clinton also appeared at the gate in 1994 , ending his speech with the words " berlin ist frei , " or " berlin is free . " the last former us president to speak in front of the gate was george bush , sr. , who inaugurated the new us embassy , which sits next to the gate , on july 4 , 2008 . us president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech on the other hand took place at schoeneberg city hall , which was the seat of the berlin mayor before the reunification of the city . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq .

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent .

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .

" if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .

however , the office was closed in 2004 .

" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .
encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .
but in 2002 , it re-established the right for german butchers to slaughter animals according to islamic religious ritual in a case brought by a turkish butcher from giessen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would n't pass the test , say critics " it 's a stupid question and the answer is even more stupid , " the organization 's spokesman ulrich ropertz told the ap news agency .
the catalogue of questions encompasses a total of 310 questions on german institutions and society .
to pass , 17 of 33 questions need to be answered correctly .
too many obstacles according to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the recent drop in the number of people gaining german citizenship indicated that applicants face too many hurdles . in 2007 , 113,000 would-be germans gained citizenship , 9.5 percent fewer than the year before .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .

" if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech .

but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.07.2008 eu parliament raises bar for extremist parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller parties now have less of a chance to form in the european parliament the european parliament has tightened the rules on forming political groups in the assembly .
critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .
many deputies were outraged that the group had been able to form in the first place . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .
it is currently the third largest contributor of foreign troops in iraq . " georgia 's geographic location also allows other allies and partners in the region to see the benefits of working with the united states , " it said . dw staff -lrb- nda / jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed .

" russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .

" if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .
lawmakers complained that government contracts should not be filled abroad at a of growing us unemployment . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation . " about 1,000 us soldiers are training alongside an equal number of georgian troops and an unspecified number of men from azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine - all of which are members of the partnership for peace . eucom called georgia a key ally in the global " war on terrorism " and regional anti-terror operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2008 france 's glamorous first lady releases new album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has vowed to continue with her songstress career despite her marriage to sarkozy after weeks of hype and breathless anticipation , carla bruni-sarkozy 's new album , offered free online this week , hits stores in france and much of europe friday , june 11 .
critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.07.2008 eu parliament raises bar for extremist parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller parties now have less of a chance to form in the european parliament the european parliament has tightened the rules on forming political groups in the assembly .
critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .
many deputies were outraged that the group had been able to form in the first place . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .
many deputies were outraged that the group had been able to form in the first place . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "

but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .
last year , a gathering of far right meps , including anti-immigrant , hard-line nationalist as well as holocaust-denying deputies , managed to form the identity , sovereignty and tradition group - only for it collapse a few months later after its members started insulting each other .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .

schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .

critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it .

is she taking a cue from france 's carla bruni ? -lrb- 15.04.2008 -rrb- experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way .

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .

the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .

while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .

" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us-based boeing was pleased with the chance to re-bid the gao ruled that the air force overlooked key aspects of the boeing proposal that could have tilted the contract in the us-based aerospace giant 's direction , and failed to inform boeing of the air force 's interest in a larger aircraft before choosing the northrop- eads bid in march .
while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .
the air force sparked outrage within congress when it handed the contract to northrop and eads .
lawmakers complained that government contracts should not be filled abroad at a of growing us unemployment . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.07.2008 eu parliament raises bar for extremist parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller parties now have less of a chance to form in the european parliament the european parliament has tightened the rules on forming political groups in the assembly .
critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .

critics say the move is a blow to democracy as it will reduce political diversity . members voted on wednesday , july 9 , to raise the minimum number of deputies needed to form a political group from 20 members from a minimum of six member states to at least 25 members , representing seven states .
according to the european parliament 's system , meps must join trans-national groups in order to qualify for campaign finance , move amendments and propose debates .
the move was approved by 481 lawmakers , with a further 203 voting against and 26 abstaining from the vote .
deputies in the european parliament will now need wider support before being able to form a political grouping .
from small to large currently , there are seven political groups in parliament and 30 unaffiliated lawmakers .
the new rules will directly affect both the euroskeptic independence / democracy group , which has 22 meps , and the rightist union for europe of the nations -lrb- uen -rrb- group , which fails to meet the member state threshold .
on the left , meanwhile , the communist european united left party , has 41 lawmakers from 14 countries , while the greens have 43 legislators from 14 countries .
the three biggest parties in the parliament are the conservative european people 's party with 288 deputies from all 27 eu countries ; the socialists with 217 from 25 countries ; and the liberals with 100 from 22 states .
safety measure according to socialist mep richard corbett , the parliament has " one of the lowest thresholds that exist for allowing the constitution of a political group . "
" just 2.5 percent of our membership can create a political group , " he said .
but the new rules came under fire from smaller groups and were also opposed by the third biggest political group in the parliament , the liberals , who called it " detrimental " to parliamentary democracy and efficiency .
supporters of the report , meanwhile , argue that the new rules will make it harder for the far-right to form a political group .

" i 've concluded that the contract can not be awarded at present because of significant issues pointed out by the government accountability office , " gates said .
a new winner for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion-euro -rrb- contract to build 179 kc-x aerial refuellers will be awarded through an expedited process to be completed by december , in what will be a limited competition to address the gao concerns .
" it is important to remember that this decision does not represent a return to the first step of a process that has already gone on far too long , " gates said , adding that the need to replace the air force 's ageing fleet of tankers was " time critical . "
critical errors opens door to new bids in a report issued june 18 , the gao upheld boeing 's formal protest that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract and urged the pentagon to reopen the competition .
john young , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , said that the pentagon will ask the defense firms to submit new proposals by the end of the summer .

while the gao decision was not binding , a failure by the pentagon to embrace the decision could have brought congressional scrutiny from lawmakers who control the defense budget .
boeing welcomed the decision by the pentagon to strip northrop and eads of the contract while saying the criteria for re-awarding the contract should not be altered .
" we welcome the decision by defense secretary robert gates not to proceed with the contract award to northrop grumman / eads and to reopen the kc-x tanker competition , " boeing said in a statement .
eads sure of second chance northrop and eads remained confident they will still win the contract and praised gates for finding a quick solution to the dispute .
" the united states air force has already picked the best tanker , and we are confident that it will do so again , " northrop spokesman randy belote said .
northrop and eads have not decided whether to alter their original proposal but would " wait and see " whether the pentagon changes the criteria , he said .
the contract was the first of three that could reach a combined value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
dozens of members of congress criticized the air force for shipping defense jobs abroad at a time when the us economy is struggling .
northrop grumman and eads had said that they would build a plant in the us state of alabama to assemble the aircraft from parts manufactured in europe .
gao auditors found that boeing offered to meet more non-mandatory requirements than northrop and that the boeing tanker could have come at a cheaper price over the life cycle of the program .
congress upset over foreign contract eads -lrb- the european aeronautic defence and space company -rrb- , the parent company of boeing rival airbus , is partly owned by european governments .
boeing complained that the air force chose the eads version based on an airbus 330 after being told that its 767 met air force requirements .
boeing said it could have proposed its 777 instead , had it been adequately informed of the air force 's needs .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would n't pass the test , say critics " it 's a stupid question and the answer is even more stupid , " the organization 's spokesman ulrich ropertz told the ap news agency .
the catalogue of questions encompasses a total of 310 questions on german institutions and society .
to pass , 17 of 33 questions need to be answered correctly .
too many obstacles according to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the recent drop in the number of people gaining german citizenship indicated that applicants face too many hurdles . in 2007 , 113,000 would-be germans gained citizenship , 9.5 percent fewer than the year before .
" germany does not have the sort of atmosphere that makes immigrants feel welcome , " said annelie buntenbach from the dgb . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would n't pass the test , say critics " it 's a stupid question and the answer is even more stupid , " the organization 's spokesman ulrich ropertz told the ap news agency .

to pass , 17 of 33 questions need to be answered correctly .
too many obstacles according to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the recent drop in the number of people gaining german citizenship indicated that applicants face too many hurdles . in 2007 , 113,000 would-be germans gained citizenship , 9.5 percent fewer than the year before .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .

green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent . " martin rieger , who heads the religion monitor , a bertelsmann project to track faith , said : " the notion that religion continuously declines from generation to generation can be clearly disproved , even in some of the industrialized nations . " religious brits the study found religious belief was stronger among young people in britain and israel than among their parents . the first findings of the bertelsmann monitor of religion , which will be continuously updated in future , were issued to mark world youth day , a catholic youth festival being celebrated with pope benedict xvi in sydney , australia on july 20 . globally , 85 percent of young people aged 18 to 29 are religious believers , with 44 percent defined as deeply religious in the sense that they often pray , discuss religious issues and are guided in day to day behavior by religion . in non-religious nations such as france , russia and austria , daily prayer is a fixture for only 9 , 8 and 7 percent of young adults respectively .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.07.2008 france 's glamorous first lady releases new album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has vowed to continue with her songstress career despite her marriage to sarkozy after weeks of hype and breathless anticipation , carla bruni-sarkozy 's new album , offered free online this week , hits stores in france and much of europe friday , june 11 .
critics are split on the first lady 's croonings . she may have captivated heads of state , won over the french who are traditionally blasé about their politicians ' private lives and helped lift her husband 's sagging approval ratings .
but can france 's first lady and model-chanteuse who married president nicolas sarkozy in february this year after a whirlwind romance pull off another coup when her latest album officially hits the stores on friday ?
the 40-year-old italian-born millionairess has certainly been doing her best to keep a hold on french heart strings with a mixture of modesty , easy elegance and nonchalance .
drug song stirs controversy helped by a high-wattage publicity machine supervised by her husband 's aides and a stream of promotional interviews in which she has demurely said she would " understand " if the french public scorn her album because of her marriage to sarkozy , bruni has said she is not planning a tour to promote the album and will donate all royalties to charity this week , she surprised many by putting the album online for free - for listening only .
called " comme si de rien n 'était " -lrb- as if nothing had happened -rrb- , the album , bruni 's third , contains 14 tracks in a mixture of rock and blues , french chanson and guitar-based folk .
bruni composed and wrote most of the songs .
one , " ma came " -lrb- my drug -rrb- in which she mentions " colombian white " has already caused controversy in colombia .
" from the mouth of the wife of the french president , this statement is very painful for colombia , " colombian foreign minister fernando araujo said recently .
colombia produces more than 80 percent of the world 's cocaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni has declared undying love for the dimunitive french president the french media has largely heaped praise in particular on the album 's torrid lyrics .
for instance , " ta tienne " -lrb- yours -rrb- , is a clear declaration of love to sarkozy .
“ you are my lord , you 're my darling , you 're my orgy . . . my charming prince i am yours . . .
i who always sought fire , am burning for you like a pagan woman , " bruni sings .
schmaltzy lyrics but not everyone is enamored by the album .
media reaction in britain , where bruni was praised for her good looks and clothes and reportedly even charmed the queen on a state visit in march with sarkozy , was largely derisive .
in a review headlined , " first lady of schmaltz , " the independent called bruni 's latest musical offering " simpering " and " weedy . "
the guardian said the listener may have trouble separating the memory of the elegant presidential wife on show in london from the singer expounding on multiple lovers and alluding to cocaine .
" the hardest part about listening to carla bruni 's new album is somehow erasing from your memory that woman in the demure , dove-grey dior coat , flat shoes and little black hat who had us all swooning back in march , " its reviewer wrote .
there were dissenting voices in france too .
le nouvel observateur , the leading left-wing news weekly , called the album pretty but trite , uninspired and boring .
marianne , an influential french political news weekly , last week slammed what it called the " carla overkill , " comparing bruni with marie-antoinette and the excesses of the 18th-century versailles court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de one year on , hopes in french president plummet a year after his election win , french president nicolas sarkozy 's ratings have nosedived amid irritation at his flamboyant lifestyle and economic woes .
but some say the french want to have their cake and eat it .
-lrb- 06.05.2008 -rrb- angela merkel raises eyebrows with cleavage display not generally considered a leader who exudes sexiness , angela merkel , made quite a splash with the plunging neckline of the evening dress she wore at the opera in oslo .
is she taking a cue from france 's carla bruni ? -lrb- 15.04.2008 -rrb- experts : no ulterior motives behind french sarkozy-bruni affair nicolas sarkozy 's relationship with carla bruni has led to speculation that the french president is trying to cover up political problems .
but insiders say the affair sets a precedent in a totally different way .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed .

" russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .

" yes , we are losing momentum , " rainer guntermann , senior economist with dresdner kleinwort in frankfurt , told the dpa news agency .
" german exports are at risk of coming off the boil . "
the problem , experts say , is the economic weakness of countries to which germany exports its products .
" the best times for exports are over , " commerzbank analyst matthias rubisch told the afp news agency .
" in western europe in particular , the main destination for german exports , the economy has suffered a serious setback . "

unemployment also fell to by 0.1 percent in june to 7.8 percent - the lowest rate in sixteen years .

" yes , we are losing momentum , " rainer guntermann , senior economist with dresdner kleinwort in frankfurt , told the dpa news agency .

" young people in developing countries and islamic states are just as religious as adults , " the study 's authors said .
" in morocco , about 99 percent believe in god and life after death .
among brazilians , turks and nigerians , 90 percent are believers and even in israel , indonesia and italy , the rate is 80 percent .

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .
encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .

it 's too hard , too ideologically biased , historically unsound and littered with errors , say its detractors . the central council of jews in germany has voiced concern about the test 's handling of the country 's nazi past , pointing out that the word " holocaust " is conspicuous in its absence .
this reflects a " strange understanding of history , " said secretary general stephan kramer .
moreover , he observed , judaism is absent from the list of multiple choice answers to a question about the main religions in europe and germany .
representatives from the muslim community , meanwhile , insist that many of the questions are ideologically biased , with the central council of muslims in germany objecting to what it sees as a testing of applicants ' attitudes .
some say test is too hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should immigrants be required to know about dog tax ?
the government rejected the accusation .
" there are no questions that test attitudes , " said a spokeswoman from the interior ministry on wednesday , july 9 .
green party leader claudia roth added her voice to the chorus of indignation resounding across germany , dismissing the test as a " grotesque multiple choice exam . "
" questions about dog tax have absolutely no relevance to citizenship , " she said .
but since the test was first unveiled in june , the main complaint it has drawn is that it is simply too difficult - in terms of both language and content .
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble of the christian democrats has consistently come to its defense : " no one should be too stretched by this test , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung on wednesday .
german integration commissioner maria boehmer agreed that the questions were not too demanding , as long as applicants did the necessary revision .
some 70 to 80 percent of applicants should be able to pass it once it is introduced in september , she maintained .
mistakes found in test meanwhile , mistakes in the test have already been discovered .
according to the test , the state office for political education is the right answer to the question : where in lower saxony can you find information on political issues ?
however , the office was closed in 2004 .
another question about the state 's flag has no correct answer , say the experts .
other questions have been deemed equally spurious .
the supposed answer to one question relating to tenancy rights was described as a moot point by the german association of tenants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would n't pass the test , say critics " it 's a stupid question and the answer is even more stupid , " the organization 's spokesman ulrich ropertz told the ap news agency .
the catalogue of questions encompasses a total of 310 questions on german institutions and society .
to pass , 17 of 33 questions need to be answered correctly .
too many obstacles according to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , the recent drop in the number of people gaining german citizenship indicated that applicants face too many hurdles . in 2007 , 113,000 would-be germans gained citizenship , 9.5 percent fewer than the year before .

" frankly , some of the things that russia did over the last couple of months added to tensions in the region , " rice was quoted by georgian media as saying . " georgia is an independent state .
it has to be treated like one .
we have said that both georgia and russia need to avoid provocative behavior , " she added . referring to russia 's reaction to the missile shield deal she signed with the czech republic on tuesday , rice said she was disappointed , " given all the effort both us defense secretary -lrb- robert -rrb- gates and i have made to offer to the russians significant ways for transparency , confidence and for cooperation . " a senior state department official echoed rice 's comments on moscow 's moves in the separatist abkhaz region to reporters traveling with the secretary of state to tbilisi , saying on condition of anonymity that " russia needs to resume its role as a neutral arbiter of peace rather than a party to the conflict , which russia is in danger of becoming . " " russia needs to realize the empire is gone , " he added . fears of escalation increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice was disappointed by russia 's response the official warned that washington feared that " a military cycle of escalation will simply develop a momentum of its own and could lead to a catastrophe in the region , " one involving " horrific " new " fighting . " hours before her arrival , russia 's foreign ministry issued a statement accusing georgia of pushing the region towards war through actions openly supported by the united states . " tbilisi 's actions represent a real threat to peace and security in the south caucasus , capable of taking the region to the brink of a new armed conflict , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry said those who " shield the provocateurs and blame everything on moscow are doing a great disservice to the georgian leadership and strengthening its sense of impunity . " the statement explicitly referred to the us state department .
russia 's sharp words came after rice , as she prepared to sign the missile defense agreement in prague , publicly blamed russia for instability in georgia . after meeting us president george w. bush at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , russian president dmitry medvedev said the signing of the missile defense agreement in prague had left russia " most distressed . " " russia is n't going to get hysterical but will be studying countermeasures , " medvedev said , in a reminder of previous russian threats to target european neighbors in response to the us missile shield . missile shield prompts drastic russian response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev 's presidency begins with a serious crisis russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday had made a more specific threat , saying that if the us missile shield was deployed near russia 's borders , " we will be forced to react ... with military resources . " russia has long argued that it regards the us missile system , which so far calls for a powerful radar tracking station in the czech republic and 10 interceptor missiles possibly in poland , as a threat to its own security . washington insists it is solely aimed at shielding the united states and its allies from missile attacks from " rogue " states such as iran . meanwhile , georgia 's saakashvili has said he wants his country to become a member of the us-led nato military alliance , a move viscerally opposed by russia but strongly backed by the united states . the russian foreign ministry on wednesday said it thought georgia may have been involved in at least some of the bombings in abkhazia last week that killed four people and injured 16 others .
georgia has denied involvement . russian peacekeepers have also accused georgia 's military of making the latest in a string of fighter jet flights over separatist south ossetia in violation of a ceasefire .
georgia denied this , countering that four russian jets had illegally flown over the area . abkhazia and south ossetia gained de facto independence from tbilisi after fighting brief wars against georgian forces following the soviet union 's 1991 collapse .
tbilisi says the regions are an integral part of georgia , but has offered abkhazia autonomy within the country . us troops begin exercises with regional forces near russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops have begun war games with the georgian army meanwhile us troops started joint training exercises with soldiers from georgia , azerbaijan , armenia and ukraine , underlining the region 's strategic importance , the us european command -lrb- eucom -rrb- said . eucom , based in the southern german city of stuttgart , said the exercises had begun saturday at vaziani military base , less than 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- from the russian border . it said the activities were " in the spirit of the nato partnership for peace program , " seen as the first step towards full membership in the military alliance . eucom described the exercises , codenamed immediate response 2008 , as an annual effort conducted between the united states and nato and coalition partners focused on " interoperability training and theater security cooperation .

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both islam and judaism reject the stunning of animals before slaughter and prescribe that animals be killed by a swift throat cut .
speaking on germany 's main public broadcaster ard , ernst breitling , president of germany 's federal chamber of veterinarians had earlier called kosher and halal slaughter " cruelty to animals . "
the body has demanded a change in german law to end an exemption for minority butchers which he said had allowed 500,000 sheep to be slaughtered annually in this way .
encouraging prejudice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim restaurants serve halal meat stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , dismissed the demand , saying it encouraged anti-religious prejudice .
" the prevention of cruelty to animals has the highest priority in judaism and prevailed long before animal-protection societies and laws existed , " he said in berlin .
only trained butchers were allowed to do such slaughtering and the animal lost consciousness within seconds this way .
he denied stunning was more humane .
the turkish society in germany , a secular group with mainly muslim members , agreed .
its president , kenan kolat , said in berlin the halal slaughter method in islam killed animals without any cruelty .
religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer says jews and muslims have a right to continue their slaughter practice german agricultural minister horst seehofer also rejected calls for a law against slaughter without stunnung .
" politicians can not ignore religious freedom , " he said , in a reference to the fact that federal constitutional law grants minorities the right to live according to their faith among themselves if they otherwise observe the law , as well as the right to exercise freely their chosen profession or trade .
in 1995 , the german constitutional court had ruled that islam did not necessarily demand ritual slaughter , making the practice illegal .
but in 2002 , it re-established the right for german butchers to slaughter animals according to islamic religious ritual in a case brought by a turkish butcher from giessen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma street child on the streets of the albanian capital tirana a recent study by the european commission on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .

in a resolution , adopted by 336 votes for , 220 against and 77 abstentions , members of the european parliament in strasbourg urged italy to end the practice until the european commission could investigate .
the assembly " urges the italian authorities to refrain from collecting fingerprints from roma , including minors , as this would clearly constitute an act of discrimination based on race and ethnic origin , " the resolution read .
italy rejects " accusations of racism " the move prompted a swift reaction from rome with italy 's european affairs minister andrea rochi slamming what he called " accusations of racism . "
" today 's resolution by the european parliament is one of the worst aspects of the eu institutions , " rochi said .
" we reject with vigor and indignation the accusations of racism . "
a " roma emergency " the italian government has evoked a " roma emergency " in large cities like milan , rome and naples and said it plans to close unauthorized camps by may 2009 and repatriate people who are in italy illegally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma shack in italy the measure comes more than a month after several gypsy camps in southern italy were torched forcing roma inhabitants to flee under police protection .
the arson attacks were triggered by violent protests after a roma youth was accused of trying to kidnap an italian baby .
roma people , known in italy as " nomads " are blamed for most of the violence which silvio berlusconi 's new government pins on illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister roberto maroni , a member of the right-wing northern league party in berlusconi 's centre-right coalition , said last week the idea behind the census was to put an end to illegal camps and guarantee security to italian citizens .
children would also be fingerprinted " to prevent phenomena such as begging , " maroni said , adding that in many cases , people are living in camps in " sub-human conditions where children are forced to live with rats . "
the italian government has defended its actions , saying it is within the realm of existing italian laws and eu directives .
widespread discrimination about half of the estimated 160,000 roma and sinti people living in italy are italian citizens , another 20 percent are citizens of other eu countries while the remainder come from the countries that once made up yugoslavia .
last month , some 3,000 roma and sinti took to the streets of rome to protest against alleged xenophobia against them amid widespread anger among italians who blame them for rising crime and insecurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a roma street child on the streets of the albanian capital tirana a recent study by the european commission on the discrimination faced by the roma found their life expectancy is 10-15 years lower than those of other europeans .

but the animal technically belongs to another zoo in the northern town of neumuenster , where officials have now gone to court to claim some of the booty . knut 's 15 weeks of fame may long be over and the adolescent polar bear has since been relegated to the sidelines by an even cuter flocke at nuremberg zoo , who is also most likely beyond initial polar bear sweetness by now . but berlin 's most famous animal certainly helped fill the coffers of the city 's zoo as some three million people - 27 percent more than before knut was born - flocked to his enclosure in 2007 . who 's your daddy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut 's now fat , dirty and no longer cute the bear 's bound to have contributed significantly to the zoo 's 6.8 million-euro -lrb- $ 10.6 million -rrb- net profit last year .
but the exact figure is what folks at neumuenster 's zoo are interested in .
that 's because knut 's father , lars , belongs to that zoo and was loaned to berlin for procreation . as part of the deal , neumuenster secured itself the rights to lars ' first , third and fifth living offspring , according to reports .
berlin does n't dispute the fact and says that knut belongs to the northern german zoo .
the additional revenue , however , is an entirely different matter . " our lawyers have told us that the zoo in neumuenster has no rights to our revenue , " a berlin zoo spokesperson told ap news service . repa -lrb- i -rrb- ration money knut 's ancestral zoo is n't giving up so quickly .
officials in neumuenster claim that berlin refused to discuss a friendly settlement of the matter and that 's why they 've now taken the matter to court and filed a legal petition to force disclosure of how much money the berlin zoo earned as a result of knut . " our zoo could really use the knut-generated money for desperately needed repairs , " said neumuenster 's zoo director , peter druewa . knut himself could not be reached for comment on the matter . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berliners are thrilled , but germany 's leader feels a little uneasy about the candidate 's election campaign event . a spokesman for conservative german chancellor angela merkel said that she had " limited understanding " for the presumptive democratic presidential candidate 's interest in holding a major policy speech in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate during his visit at the end of the month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- thinks the gate should be reserved for elected leaders " it is unusual to hold election rallies abroad , " he said .
" no german candidate for high office would even think of using the national mall -lrb- in washington -rrb- or red square in moscow for a rally because it would not be seen as appropriate . " members of obama 's team have confirmed that he will visit berlin on july 24 as part of a european and middle eastern tour that will also take him to france , britain , israel and jordan . they said that he plans to give a speech in the german capital .
while obama has reportedly not yet made a decision on where his appearance will take place , brandenburg gate , the symbol of german reunification , has largely been pegged as the most likely spot . obama " … will choose -lrb- a site -rrb- that makes most sense for him and his german hosts , " the senator 's spokesman told reporters , adding that obama was looking forward to the opportunity to meet merkel . steinmeier welcomes obama in sharp contrast to merkel 's views on a stage for obama 's speech , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , welcomed the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and merkel are n't particularly close " the americans contributed decisively to saving the city of berlin ; that is why we should make historic sites such as the brandenburg gate available to them , " steinmeier , who has a history of clashing with merkel , told frankfurter rundschau daily . " if barack obama decides to take a trip to europe and to visit berlin as well as britain and france then we should warmly welcome it , " he said .
" we should see his desire to visit as a sign of the importance that trans-atlantic ties have for him - and react positively . " steinmeier 's spokesman said that presumptive republican candidate john mccain would also be welcome to speak at the gate should he choose to do so . berlin city officials have meanwhile expressed their willingness to let obama use the gate as a backdrop for his speech . " i would be happy to if barack obama uses berlin as a platform to give a major policy speech , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit , a social democrat , told berliner zeitung daily .
he added that his city government would support the visit , but not organize it . presidential gate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reagan spoke at the gate on june 12 , 1987 the brandenburg gate has been used for american presidents before .
in 1987 , then us president ronald reagan mad a famous appearance in front of the landmark , which was still cut off by the wall at that time .
in his speech , reagan called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to " tear down this wall . " former us president bill clinton also appeared at the gate in 1994 , ending his speech with the words " berlin ist frei , " or " berlin is free . " the last former us president to speak in front of the gate was george bush , sr. , who inaugurated the new us embassy , which sits next to the gate , on july 4 , 2008 . us president john f. kennedy 's famous " ich bin ein berliner " speech on the other hand took place at schoeneberg city hall , which was the seat of the berlin mayor before the reunification of the city . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- approval of the plan is a key condition for putting into effect a nuclear deal between india and us .
left-wing parties in india have pulled out of the governing coalition in protest against the deal .
the government says it is needed to meet soaring energy demands .
india is under pressure from washington to sign the accord before the us presidential elections in november .
reports say a restricted draft of india 's plans for safeguarding nuclear facilities has been given to iaea 's 35 member nations ahead of a meeting to approve the agreement .
' big problem ' daryl kimball of the washington-based arms control association told reuters news agency that there were several points in the draft that appear to restrict international monitoring of india 's atomic programme .
he said the draft says india may " take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies " .
fuel supplies could be disrupted only if india were to resume testing nuclear weapons , experts say .
" does this mean that india intends to withdraw from what are supposed to be permanent safeguards if it tests and other states decide to terminate fuel supplies ? "
mr kimball said .
" if so , that is a big problem and the indian government has not clarified what it means . "
the us had restricted nuclear co-operation with india - which has not signed the 1972 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - since it first tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
under the terms of the nuclear accord , india would get access to us civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center in return , delhi would open its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection - but its nuclear weapons sites would remain off-limits .
us president george w bush has spoken again of the importance of the deal in talks with indian pm manmohan singh on the sidelines of the g8 summit in japan on wednesday .
critics of the deal fear assistance to india 's civil programme could free-up additional radioactive material for bomb-making purposes .
the deal now needs to be approved by the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , as well as by the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade .
separately , mr singh is due to meet the indian president to discuss political developments arising out of the left-wing parties ' withdrawal of support to the government .
the communists , who command 59 seats in the lower house of parliament , formally withdrew support for the government on wednesday after it vowed to press ahead with the agreement .
the congress-led government is hoping that a regional party will help them survive a vote of confidence and fend off early elections .

the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- approval of the plan is a key condition for putting into effect a nuclear deal between india and us .
left-wing parties in india have pulled out of the governing coalition in protest against the deal .
the government says it is needed to meet soaring energy demands .
india is under pressure from washington to sign the accord before the us presidential elections in november .
reports say a restricted draft of india 's plans for safeguarding nuclear facilities has been given to iaea 's 35 member nations ahead of a meeting to approve the agreement .
' big problem ' daryl kimball of the washington-based arms control association told reuters news agency that there were several points in the draft that appear to restrict international monitoring of india 's atomic programme .
he said the draft says india may " take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies " .
fuel supplies could be disrupted only if india were to resume testing nuclear weapons , experts say .
" does this mean that india intends to withdraw from what are supposed to be permanent safeguards if it tests and other states decide to terminate fuel supplies ? "
mr kimball said .
" if so , that is a big problem and the indian government has not clarified what it means . "
the us had restricted nuclear co-operation with india - which has not signed the 1972 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - since it first tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
under the terms of the nuclear accord , india would get access to us civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center in return , delhi would open its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection - but its nuclear weapons sites would remain off-limits .
us president george w bush has spoken again of the importance of the deal in talks with indian pm manmohan singh on the sidelines of the g8 summit in japan on wednesday .
critics of the deal fear assistance to india 's civil programme could free-up additional radioactive material for bomb-making purposes .
the deal now needs to be approved by the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , as well as by the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade .
separately , mr singh is due to meet the indian president to discuss political developments arising out of the left-wing parties ' withdrawal of support to the government .
the communists , who command 59 seats in the lower house of parliament , formally withdrew support for the government on wednesday after it vowed to press ahead with the agreement .
the congress-led government is hoping that a regional party will help them survive a vote of confidence and fend off early elections .

he said the draft says india may " take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption of foreign fuel supplies " .
fuel supplies could be disrupted only if india were to resume testing nuclear weapons , experts say .
" does this mean that india intends to withdraw from what are supposed to be permanent safeguards if it tests and other states decide to terminate fuel supplies ? "
mr kimball said .
" if so , that is a big problem and the indian government has not clarified what it means . "
the us had restricted nuclear co-operation with india - which has not signed the 1972 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - since it first tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
under the terms of the nuclear accord , india would get access to us civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center in return , delhi would open its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection - but its nuclear weapons sites would remain off-limits .
us president george w bush has spoken again of the importance of the deal in talks with indian pm manmohan singh on the sidelines of the g8 summit in japan on wednesday .
critics of the deal fear assistance to india 's civil programme could free-up additional radioactive material for bomb-making purposes .
the deal now needs to be approved by the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , as well as by the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade .
separately , mr singh is due to meet the indian president to discuss political developments arising out of the left-wing parties ' withdrawal of support to the government .
the communists , who command 59 seats in the lower house of parliament , formally withdrew support for the government on wednesday after it vowed to press ahead with the agreement .
the congress-led government is hoping that a regional party will help them survive a vote of confidence and fend off early elections .

the busy intersection would be adapted under a £ 4m investment plan inspired by tokyo 's shibuya crossing , where pedestrians cross with ease .
if the proposal went ahead work would start in summer 2009 and take about nine months to complete .
the oxford circus plan would form part of a £ 40m investment programme designed to upgrade the west end .
' world class ' westminster city council 's danny chalkley said : " we want to make it as easy as possible for the 200 million visitors a year who come to the west end to get around on foot , and looking to japan for ideas makes perfect sense . "
the council is asking londoners for their views on the plan during nine weeks of consultation .
mr chalkley said improvements to the west end would make it " truly world class " in time for london 's 2012 olympics .
plans to give oxford , regent and bond streets wider pavements , a series of side street " oases " for al fresco dining and cutting edge lighting are already being undertaken .
the project is co-funded by the council , transport for london , new west end company - which represents retailers in the area - and the crown estate , which owns much of the land in the west end .
