now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe . " if they continue playing the way they have this season , there is no reason why they will not be able to maintain their challenge .
they are a strong side and deserve to be where they are . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will be looking to maintain its bundesliga lead this weekend against hoffenheim the only team to have managed to win the league championship as a promoted team was kaiserslautern in 1998 , but hoffenheim is hoping to follow suit . around the grounds the other matches on sunday see vfb stuttgart at home to vfl bochum , while an intriguing game takes place in dortmund , where former champions league winners borussia dortmund entertain hertha berlin . meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg coach felix magath will be facing his former club when his men travel to bavaria to meet bayern munich . defending champions bayern , who sit disappointingly in 11th place with 12 points , are hoping that last week 's victory against karlsruhe and the midweek champions league win over fiorentina , are a signal of better things to come . manager uli hoeness certainly seems to think so .
" let me be fairly aggressive .
i believe we will still become winter champions and then much of the criticism will fall away . " another team looking to get back into the swing of things is werder bremen , which have scored 22 goals , more than any other team , but are simultaneously leaking goals at the back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will be looking to shore up its defense after letting in 19 goals so far this season the 19 goals conceded by keeper tim wiese is more than any other bundesliga keeper .
on saturday , christian vander will replace wiese between the sticks for werder after the latter was sidelined for two weeks with an injury . meanwhile , 65-year-old coach hans meyer will take charge of borussia moenchengladbach for the first time in his second stint at the club when they host karlsruhe at home . in other matches on saturday , schalke take on arminia bielefeld , while energie cottbus face eintracht frankfurt . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe .

" let me be fairly aggressive .
i believe we will still become winter champions and then much of the criticism will fall away . " another team looking to get back into the swing of things is werder bremen , which have scored 22 goals , more than any other team , but are simultaneously leaking goals at the back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will be looking to shore up its defense after letting in 19 goals so far this season the 19 goals conceded by keeper tim wiese is more than any other bundesliga keeper .
on saturday , christian vander will replace wiese between the sticks for werder after the latter was sidelined for two weeks with an injury . meanwhile , 65-year-old coach hans meyer will take charge of borussia moenchengladbach for the first time in his second stint at the club when they host karlsruhe at home . in other matches on saturday , schalke take on arminia bielefeld , while energie cottbus face eintracht frankfurt . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation . " the german government 's 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 610 billion -rrb- rescue package for troubled banks , approved last week , is to last through 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck predicts further economic gloom for germany " we will certainly need it for that duration , " steinbrueck predicted . he also said it would take years for germany to gauge whether the rescue package had racked up real costs . " we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has pressed for financial reform during her visit to china " we can see that trust in the financial markets has yet to be fully restored , " merkel said , following another week of extreme volatility on stock markets in the us , europe and asia . the chancellor also called for a reform of the tattered financial system - including substantially more oversight - as the only way to prevent future crises of this nature . in addition to the bank rescue plan , the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy . the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help . more bad news more bad news hit germany friday , with auto giant volkswagen announcing it would cut output while maintaining it would meet its 2008 sales targets . the bellwether dax stock index closed friday at 4,295.67 , down 10 per cent in just a week , as investors reacted to fears in key asian and european export markets . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe . " if they continue playing the way they have this season , there is no reason why they will not be able to maintain their challenge .
they are a strong side and deserve to be where they are . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will be looking to maintain its bundesliga lead this weekend against hoffenheim the only team to have managed to win the league championship as a promoted team was kaiserslautern in 1998 , but hoffenheim is hoping to follow suit . around the grounds the other matches on sunday see vfb stuttgart at home to vfl bochum , while an intriguing game takes place in dortmund , where former champions league winners borussia dortmund entertain hertha berlin . meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg coach felix magath will be facing his former club when his men travel to bavaria to meet bayern munich . defending champions bayern , who sit disappointingly in 11th place with 12 points , are hoping that last week 's victory against karlsruhe and the midweek champions league win over fiorentina , are a signal of better things to come . manager uli hoeness certainly seems to think so .
" let me be fairly aggressive .
i believe we will still become winter champions and then much of the criticism will fall away . " another team looking to get back into the swing of things is werder bremen , which have scored 22 goals , more than any other team , but are simultaneously leaking goals at the back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will be looking to shore up its defense after letting in 19 goals so far this season the 19 goals conceded by keeper tim wiese is more than any other bundesliga keeper .

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation . " the german government 's 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 610 billion -rrb- rescue package for troubled banks , approved last week , is to last through 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck predicts further economic gloom for germany " we will certainly need it for that duration , " steinbrueck predicted . he also said it would take years for germany to gauge whether the rescue package had racked up real costs . " we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has pressed for financial reform during her visit to china " we can see that trust in the financial markets has yet to be fully restored , " merkel said , following another week of extreme volatility on stock markets in the us , europe and asia . the chancellor also called for a reform of the tattered financial system - including substantially more oversight - as the only way to prevent future crises of this nature . in addition to the bank rescue plan , the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy . the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help . more bad news more bad news hit germany friday , with auto giant volkswagen announcing it would cut output while maintaining it would meet its 2008 sales targets . the bellwether dax stock index closed friday at 4,295.67 , down 10 per cent in just a week , as investors reacted to fears in key asian and european export markets . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation .

" we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .

" the german government 's 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 610 billion -rrb- rescue package for troubled banks , approved last week , is to last through 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck predicts further economic gloom for germany " we will certainly need it for that duration , " steinbrueck predicted . he also said it would take years for germany to gauge whether the rescue package had racked up real costs . " we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has pressed for financial reform during her visit to china " we can see that trust in the financial markets has yet to be fully restored , " merkel said , following another week of extreme volatility on stock markets in the us , europe and asia . the chancellor also called for a reform of the tattered financial system - including substantially more oversight - as the only way to prevent future crises of this nature . in addition to the bank rescue plan , the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy . the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help . more bad news more bad news hit germany friday , with auto giant volkswagen announcing it would cut output while maintaining it would meet its 2008 sales targets . the bellwether dax stock index closed friday at 4,295.67 , down 10 per cent in just a week , as investors reacted to fears in key asian and european export markets . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .
in 2009 , germany 's economic output will fall by 1.5 percent , a spokesman for the bank 's research division told the berliner zeitung . ulrich kater , chief economist of the dekabank told newspaper bild that the german economy had already slipped into a recession in the third quarter of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .

now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe . " if they continue playing the way they have this season , there is no reason why they will not be able to maintain their challenge .
they are a strong side and deserve to be where they are . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will be looking to maintain its bundesliga lead this weekend against hoffenheim the only team to have managed to win the league championship as a promoted team was kaiserslautern in 1998 , but hoffenheim is hoping to follow suit . around the grounds the other matches on sunday see vfb stuttgart at home to vfl bochum , while an intriguing game takes place in dortmund , where former champions league winners borussia dortmund entertain hertha berlin . meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg coach felix magath will be facing his former club when his men travel to bavaria to meet bayern munich . defending champions bayern , who sit disappointingly in 11th place with 12 points , are hoping that last week 's victory against karlsruhe and the midweek champions league win over fiorentina , are a signal of better things to come . manager uli hoeness certainly seems to think so .
" let me be fairly aggressive .
i believe we will still become winter champions and then much of the criticism will fall away . " another team looking to get back into the swing of things is werder bremen , which have scored 22 goals , more than any other team , but are simultaneously leaking goals at the back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will be looking to shore up its defense after letting in 19 goals so far this season the 19 goals conceded by keeper tim wiese is more than any other bundesliga keeper .
on saturday , christian vander will replace wiese between the sticks for werder after the latter was sidelined for two weeks with an injury . meanwhile , 65-year-old coach hans meyer will take charge of borussia moenchengladbach for the first time in his second stint at the club when they host karlsruhe at home . in other matches on saturday , schalke take on arminia bielefeld , while energie cottbus face eintracht frankfurt . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation . " the german government 's 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 610 billion -rrb- rescue package for troubled banks , approved last week , is to last through 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck predicts further economic gloom for germany " we will certainly need it for that duration , " steinbrueck predicted . he also said it would take years for germany to gauge whether the rescue package had racked up real costs . " we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has pressed for financial reform during her visit to china " we can see that trust in the financial markets has yet to be fully restored , " merkel said , following another week of extreme volatility on stock markets in the us , europe and asia . the chancellor also called for a reform of the tattered financial system - including substantially more oversight - as the only way to prevent future crises of this nature . in addition to the bank rescue plan , the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy . the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help . more bad news more bad news hit germany friday , with auto giant volkswagen announcing it would cut output while maintaining it would meet its 2008 sales targets . the bellwether dax stock index closed friday at 4,295.67 , down 10 per cent in just a week , as investors reacted to fears in key asian and european export markets . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .

" the risk of collapse is far from over .

germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance .

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation . " the german government 's 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 610 billion -rrb- rescue package for troubled banks , approved last week , is to last through 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck predicts further economic gloom for germany " we will certainly need it for that duration , " steinbrueck predicted . he also said it would take years for germany to gauge whether the rescue package had racked up real costs . " we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has pressed for financial reform during her visit to china " we can see that trust in the financial markets has yet to be fully restored , " merkel said , following another week of extreme volatility on stock markets in the us , europe and asia . the chancellor also called for a reform of the tattered financial system - including substantially more oversight - as the only way to prevent future crises of this nature . in addition to the bank rescue plan , the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy . the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help . more bad news more bad news hit germany friday , with auto giant volkswagen announcing it would cut output while maintaining it would meet its 2008 sales targets . the bellwether dax stock index closed friday at 4,295.67 , down 10 per cent in just a week , as investors reacted to fears in key asian and european export markets . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .
in 2009 , germany 's economic output will fall by 1.5 percent , a spokesman for the bank 's research division told the berliner zeitung . ulrich kater , chief economist of the dekabank told newspaper bild that the german economy had already slipped into a recession in the third quarter of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation .

germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance .

klinsmann replaced massimo oddo with borowski for the second half and his offensive tactics paid quick dividends as van bommel equalized on 54 minutes with a header after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio could only block miroslav klose 's effort . magath brought on christian gentner for makoto hasebe and the midfielder should have equalized on the hour mark but hesitated for too long when clear in front of the bayern goal , allowing demichelis enough time to clear his goalbound effort . three minutes later , bayern 's comeback was complete as borowski fired the home side in front and schweinsteiger ensured the win by making it 4-2 by tapping home 10 minutes from time . " the morale was excellent , " said klinsmann .
" we are moving step by step towards the top . " werder bremen fail to break hanover werder bremen lost ground on the leaders after drawing 1-1 with hanover 96 . former bremen player christian schulz headed the home side in front after nine minutes but hugo almeida equalized for thomas schaaf 's side with a delicious lob four minutes from the break .

now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe .

klinsmann replaced massimo oddo with borowski for the second half and his offensive tactics paid quick dividends as van bommel equalized on 54 minutes with a header after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio could only block miroslav klose 's effort . magath brought on christian gentner for makoto hasebe and the midfielder should have equalized on the hour mark but hesitated for too long when clear in front of the bayern goal , allowing demichelis enough time to clear his goalbound effort . three minutes later , bayern 's comeback was complete as borowski fired the home side in front and schweinsteiger ensured the win by making it 4-2 by tapping home 10 minutes from time . " the morale was excellent , " said klinsmann .
" we are moving step by step towards the top . " werder bremen fail to break hanover werder bremen lost ground on the leaders after drawing 1-1 with hanover 96 . former bremen player christian schulz headed the home side in front after nine minutes but hugo almeida equalized for thomas schaaf 's side with a delicious lob four minutes from the break . " we should have won with the amount of goal chances we had , " said bremen midfielder torsten frings .
" we were the better team for long periods . " energie cottbus remain bottom of the table despite a brace from dimitar rangelov that put the eastern german side two goals in front against eintracht frankfurt . michael fink reduced the deficit for frankfurt before second-half efforts from martin fenin and nikos liberopoulos gave friedhelm funkel 's side a 3-2 win . borussia moenchengladbach gave their chances of bundesliga survival a boost as a second-half goal from patrick paauwe secured a 1-0 victory over sc karlsruhe . while hamburg and hoffenheim meet sunday with the winner assured of top spot , vfb stuttgart entertain vfl bochum and borussia dortmund welcome hertha berlin . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .

now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe . " if they continue playing the way they have this season , there is no reason why they will not be able to maintain their challenge .
they are a strong side and deserve to be where they are . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg will be looking to maintain its bundesliga lead this weekend against hoffenheim the only team to have managed to win the league championship as a promoted team was kaiserslautern in 1998 , but hoffenheim is hoping to follow suit . around the grounds the other matches on sunday see vfb stuttgart at home to vfl bochum , while an intriguing game takes place in dortmund , where former champions league winners borussia dortmund entertain hertha berlin . meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg coach felix magath will be facing his former club when his men travel to bavaria to meet bayern munich . defending champions bayern , who sit disappointingly in 11th place with 12 points , are hoping that last week 's victory against karlsruhe and the midweek champions league win over fiorentina , are a signal of better things to come . manager uli hoeness certainly seems to think so .
" let me be fairly aggressive .
i believe we will still become winter champions and then much of the criticism will fall away . " another team looking to get back into the swing of things is werder bremen , which have scored 22 goals , more than any other team , but are simultaneously leaking goals at the back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder will be looking to shore up its defense after letting in 19 goals so far this season the 19 goals conceded by keeper tim wiese is more than any other bundesliga keeper .
on saturday , christian vander will replace wiese between the sticks for werder after the latter was sidelined for two weeks with an injury . meanwhile , 65-year-old coach hans meyer will take charge of borussia moenchengladbach for the first time in his second stint at the club when they host karlsruhe at home . in other matches on saturday , schalke take on arminia bielefeld , while energie cottbus face eintracht frankfurt . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the risk of collapse is far from over .

" we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .

in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .

klinsmann replaced massimo oddo with borowski for the second half and his offensive tactics paid quick dividends as van bommel equalized on 54 minutes with a header after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio could only block miroslav klose 's effort . magath brought on christian gentner for makoto hasebe and the midfielder should have equalized on the hour mark but hesitated for too long when clear in front of the bayern goal , allowing demichelis enough time to clear his goalbound effort . three minutes later , bayern 's comeback was complete as borowski fired the home side in front and schweinsteiger ensured the win by making it 4-2 by tapping home 10 minutes from time . " the morale was excellent , " said klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2008 germany 's finance minister warns crisis far from over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , europe 's largest economy , has been buffeted by the financial storm germany 's finance minister has grimly predicted the global financial crisis will last at least until late 2009 and said it will take years for germany to assess the real costs of its 480-billion-euro bank rescue package . in an interview with german weekly bild am sonntag , to be published sunday , german finance minister peer steinbrueck offered a bleak assessment of germany 's financial health amid growing concerns of a global recession . " the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .
" we 're still dealing with a dangerous situation . " the german government 's 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 610 billion -rrb- rescue package for troubled banks , approved last week , is to last through 2009 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck predicts further economic gloom for germany " we will certainly need it for that duration , " steinbrueck predicted . he also said it would take years for germany to gauge whether the rescue package had racked up real costs . " we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing . " we know that we can influence events in germany , " merkel said at the conclusion of the summit .
" which is why the government will take measures where we can help specific sectors " that are troubled , she added without going into detail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has pressed for financial reform during her visit to china " we can see that trust in the financial markets has yet to be fully restored , " merkel said , following another week of extreme volatility on stock markets in the us , europe and asia . the chancellor also called for a reform of the tattered financial system - including substantially more oversight - as the only way to prevent future crises of this nature . in addition to the bank rescue plan , the german government , an uneasy coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , is drawing up a series of measures to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy . the government has said the auto and construction industries could get help . more bad news more bad news hit germany friday , with auto giant volkswagen announcing it would cut output while maintaining it would meet its 2008 sales targets . the bellwether dax stock index closed friday at 4,295.67 , down 10 per cent in just a week , as investors reacted to fears in key asian and european export markets . on friday , germany 's deutsche bank predicted a severe recession in germany .
in 2009 , germany 's economic output will fall by 1.5 percent , a spokesman for the bank 's research division told the berliner zeitung . ulrich kater , chief economist of the dekabank told newspaper bild that the german economy had already slipped into a recession in the third quarter of 2008 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .

now the bundesliga upstarts take on table-toppers hamburg this weekend . on sunday , a capacity crowd of 26,300 will be in the carl-benz-stadion in mannheim to see the club take on bundesliga table-toppers sv hamburg . but what makes this match so remarkable is not that few germans actually knew where hoffenheim is before the start of this bundesliga season . nor is that the small town has less than 4,000 inhabitants or that the team skipped from third division through to first division without abatement . no .
what makes the upcoming match so extra-ordinary is that it pits first against second . hamburg still pretty on 17 points , while the rookies have earned 16 . german football icon franz beckenbauer has said he believes ralf rangnick 's hoffenheim to be strong enough to challenge for a place in europe .

" let me be fairly aggressive .
i believe we will still become winter champions and then much of the criticism will fall away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

klinsmann replaced massimo oddo with borowski for the second half and his offensive tactics paid quick dividends as van bommel equalized on 54 minutes with a header after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio could only block miroslav klose 's effort . magath brought on christian gentner for makoto hasebe and the midfielder should have equalized on the hour mark but hesitated for too long when clear in front of the bayern goal , allowing demichelis enough time to clear his goalbound effort . three minutes later , bayern 's comeback was complete as borowski fired the home side in front and schweinsteiger ensured the win by making it 4-2 by tapping home 10 minutes from time . " the morale was excellent , " said klinsmann .
" we are moving step by step towards the top . " werder bremen fail to break hanover werder bremen lost ground on the leaders after drawing 1-1 with hanover 96 . former bremen player christian schulz headed the home side in front after nine minutes but hugo almeida equalized for thomas schaaf 's side with a delicious lob four minutes from the break . " we should have won with the amount of goal chances we had , " said bremen midfielder torsten frings .

klinsmann replaced massimo oddo with borowski for the second half and his offensive tactics paid quick dividends as van bommel equalized on 54 minutes with a header after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio could only block miroslav klose 's effort . magath brought on christian gentner for makoto hasebe and the midfielder should have equalized on the hour mark but hesitated for too long when clear in front of the bayern goal , allowing demichelis enough time to clear his goalbound effort . three minutes later , bayern 's comeback was complete as borowski fired the home side in front and schweinsteiger ensured the win by making it 4-2 by tapping home 10 minutes from time . " the morale was excellent , " said klinsmann .
" we are moving step by step towards the top . " werder bremen fail to break hanover werder bremen lost ground on the leaders after drawing 1-1 with hanover 96 . former bremen player christian schulz headed the home side in front after nine minutes but hugo almeida equalized for thomas schaaf 's side with a delicious lob four minutes from the break . " we should have won with the amount of goal chances we had , " said bremen midfielder torsten frings .

" the risk of collapse is far from over .
any all-clear would be wrong , " steinbrueck said .

" we wo n't know whether the rescue plan will entail real costs until between 2010 and 2013 or whether the state can sell the stakes it receives in banks in return for the rescue package and make up the losses , " he added . german banks have been slow to line up for state aid under the rescue plan , with some suggesting the banks feared strict caps on salaries for executives and other restrictions being imposed on them as well as being stigmatized by peers . publicly owned regional bank bayernlb this week became the first bank to say it would tap the new fund , while westlb and hsh nordbank said on saturday they would probably follow its lead . the finance minister also distanced himself from the government 's previous goal to balance the federal budget by 2011 .
germany this year has already balanced its public budget when adding together its federal , local and social security accounts , but the federal budget itself is in the red . while saying the financial crisis posed no threat to the government 's 2011 budget goal , steinbrueck added : " but we 're not saying that we will get there under any circumstance . " merkel presses for financial overhaul steinbrueck 's comments came as german chancellor merkel called for tighter regulation and supervision of financial markets at a biannual asia-europe summit in beijing .

klinsmann replaced massimo oddo with borowski for the second half and his offensive tactics paid quick dividends as van bommel equalized on 54 minutes with a header after wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio could only block miroslav klose 's effort . magath brought on christian gentner for makoto hasebe and the midfielder should have equalized on the hour mark but hesitated for too long when clear in front of the bayern goal , allowing demichelis enough time to clear his goalbound effort . three minutes later , bayern 's comeback was complete as borowski fired the home side in front and schweinsteiger ensured the win by making it 4-2 by tapping home 10 minutes from time . " the morale was excellent , " said klinsmann .
" we are moving step by step towards the top . " werder bremen fail to break hanover werder bremen lost ground on the leaders after drawing 1-1 with hanover 96 . former bremen player christian schulz headed the home side in front after nine minutes but hugo almeida equalized for thomas schaaf 's side with a delicious lob four minutes from the break . " we should have won with the amount of goal chances we had , " said bremen midfielder torsten frings .
" we were the better team for long periods . " energie cottbus remain bottom of the table despite a brace from dimitar rangelov that put the eastern german side two goals in front against eintracht frankfurt . michael fink reduced the deficit for frankfurt before second-half efforts from martin fenin and nikos liberopoulos gave friedhelm funkel 's side a 3-2 win . borussia moenchengladbach gave their chances of bundesliga survival a boost as a second-half goal from patrick paauwe secured a 1-0 victory over sc karlsruhe . while hamburg and hoffenheim meet sunday with the winner assured of top spot , vfb stuttgart entertain vfl bochum and borussia dortmund welcome hertha berlin . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.10.2008 german minister : people must invest in their own education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : individuals should be willing to contribute to their own education , schavan says just days after germany 's controversial education summit , the country 's education minister tells dw-tv in an exclusive interview that people ca n't just rely on the state to pay for their university . dw-tv : ms. schavan , plenty of planning went into the recent high-profile education summit .
but the meeting only lasted two hours - then it broke up in disarray .
was it worth it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schavan has been german education minister since 2005 annette schavan : we did not break up in disarray .
the federal government and the states , all political parties included , reached an unprecedented level of agreement .
that included content and goals for the educational system , and we also agreed to think about ways of improving the financial side of the equation .
the consensus is good for the educational system and it 's good for schools .
in two years time , we 'll issue our first progress report . but there has been criticism from the state premiers .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit pointed out that chancellor merkel made only provisional financial commitments .
why hold back if education is so vitally important ? i thought mr. wowereit 's comments were surprising , because we agreed to devote 10 percent of gdp for education and research .
everyone knows from the debate about research funding , that the 3 percent set by the european lisbon strategy , was agreed as a goal to mobilize funds .
if mr. wowereit was thinking the federal government would be the only source of funding , then , of course he was mistaken .
these are medium-term objectives we 're talking about , because the federal government has already earmarked several billion euros for additional spending on education in 2009 and 2010 . when we consider that the summit agreed to halve the number of people who break off their studies before their school-leaving examinations - well , these goals are n't new .
what can you achieve now that 's not been achieved before ? up till now it had n't been agreed .
this is the first time the government and the states have agreed , and there 's not just one primary goal , there 's consensus on concrete measures .
as was previously the case - incidentally with federal funding - we want to encourage the provision of better incentives for those who leave school with no qualifications - or weak ones .
also with federal funding , we 'll be ensuring these people get a better start in further training .
so this is a very good example where for the first time a clear aim has been set and concrete objectives agreed . scientists maintain that human brain development is fastest between the ages of three and six .
but critics say exactly this age group is just not being challenged .
in your paper - the conclusion of the summit - you propose a closer interlocking of pre-school education with scholastic education .
does that mean that kindergarten teachers will need a university degree ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : well-qualified educators are needed in kindergartens we have further developed the student loan system to promote ongoing training of kindergarten teachers .
that 's an important point .
our second point is to praise as good practice the presence of other qualified staff alongside the usual kindergarten teachers , who , can , for example , take on management tasks after completing appropriate higher education courses .
the two will be complementary , and it would certainly be wrong to hinder the professional chances of those who have a good school leaving certificate .
the mixture will ensure that kindergartens really can be education centers of excellence . the three-tier school system that we have in germany has long been criticized - above all , the vocational schools , and not just by international assessments .
can we reform it , or do we have to keep the school system as it is at present and why ? i 'm in favor of a diverse school system .
many countries no longer have a three-stream system - some eastern german states have a two-stage system .
it 's worst where we have four fragmented different systems side by side .
the decision to attend any one school should not determine the school leaving certificate .
and as far as elementary schools are concerned , i 'm not solving a problem when i simply close one of them .
the central question under discussion is this " are children being educated enough for their subsequent vocational needs . "
it 's about giving young people the chances , and we owe them that .
but their opportunities wo n't improve if i simply abolish one school after another . it 's often claimed that we should provide children from socially weak or immigrant families with extra support , at all-day schools and not just in the mornings .
in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in view of the government 's efforts towards integration , do n't we urgently need to introduce schooling for the whole day ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools lack cafeterias and ca n't keep their students all day we do need more day-long schools .
that 's why the central government is devoting four billion euros to infrastructure improvements - by that i mean dining facilities , class rooms , extra buildings .
every fourth school in germany is being extended so that these schools can improve further .
children do need more time in school , especially if they receive little support when they 're away from school .
the educational system of the future will feature more all-day schools . right now , education and schools are the responsibility of the federal states .
they 're probably none too keen on you as education minister or even the chancellor stealing their thunder .
in view of the problems we have in the education and school sectors , is it really appropriate to have disagreements over who does what ? the government has not invading anyone 's stomping ground - education in germany is a wonderful and varied park which we all have to live in .
it 's silly to imply that anyone in national politics , either in the bundestag or in the government , should n't be interested in education just because it 's in the hands of the federal states .
that applies to vocational training , further education and much that has to do with children and the world they live in .
we 've said from the very beginning that we 'll concentrate on what we can achieve together .
the federal states will keep their responsibilities .
there 's no debate over competencies , things should continue as they 've been agreed . the social democrats demand free education , above all no tuition fees at universities and colleges .
a study from your own ministry states found that a shocking number of school leavers are deterred by fees .
even so , you 're still in favor of tuition fees .
why ? two points are important here .
firstly : anyone saying that education is important and is worth investing in ca n't just expect that from the state .
that also applies to both companies and individuals .
secondly , no-one should be deterred from studying because their parents do n't earn enough - that 's the central issue .
if someone does n't feel financially capable of paying fees - which amounts about 80 euros a month - well , you can say it 's a lot or not much - depending on how much you can afford .
that 's why it 's important that we 've increased student support grants by 10 percent , and income allowances by 8 percent .
it 's also important that we 're giving considerably more money to the eleven organizations that promote young talent by awarding scholarships .
and it 's also important for the businesses that are always saying we need more qualified people , to establish scholarships for them .
even now , the federal states are looking at how to extend the current scholarships . interview : friedrich g. schmidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the colonels are suspected of killing 11 young men from bogota and passing their victims off as combat casualties in order to gain promotions .
it is believed the three soldiers , from the elite 15th mobile brigade , kidnapped or lured the homeless men from the city with the promise of work .
but instead , the victims were taken to norte de santander province and killed .
the province , near the venezuelan border , is where the 15th mobile brigade is stationed .
an investigation by the attorney general is now under way into the disappearances .
the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott in medellin says the sacking of the three colonels could be start of a scandal that could spread through the army and threaten the security policy of president alvaro uribe .
there are reports of similar actions in different parts of the country , suggesting that this could be a widespread practice .
the defence minister juan manuel santos has sought to distance himself from the scandal , saying that there were elements of the army that were interested only in filling body bags and that this was not the policy of the government .
mr uribe , who had also sought to play down the reports of extrajudicial executions , was forced to admit that there was evidence of grave abuses of human rights in the army .
sources in the attorney general 's office said that hundreds of soldiers were under investigation in similar cases .

the number of pupils suspended 10 times or more in a year more than doubled between 2004 and 2007 , while permanent exclusions fell by 13 % .
the tories , who revealed the figures , say it is because head teachers ' hands are tied over long-term exclusions .
the government says that schools are reducing low-level disruption .
the department for children , schools and families figures show that the number of permanent exclusions fell 13 % from 9,990 to 8,680 over the four years to 2007 . "
repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need " nick gibb shadow schools minister tackling disruptive pupils at the same time the number of pupils given repeat suspensions grew markedly .
the number of those given five or more fixed-term exclusions in a year increased by 50 % from 9,090 to 14,850 .
while the number of those excluded on 10 occasions or more in a single year increased two and a half times from 310 to 830 .
and some 17,400 more pupils were suspended more than once in the year 2006-07 than in 2003-04 , when 71,370 pupils were excluded for a fixed term .
shadow schools minister nick gibb , who highlighted the figures , said senior teaching staff were being hampered by parents ' right to challenge decisions through an independent appeals panel .
he said : " very often those appeal panels overturn these expulsions and these children return back to the schools " .
he added : " the huge growth in repeat suspensions is a result of the government tying the hands of head teachers to exclude .
" the government 's approach to discipline in schools is a complete mess .
" repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need to get back on the straight and narrow .
" heads need to be free to exclude disruptive and violent pupils without being second guessed or penalised for doing so . "
' popular myth ' from the today programme more from today programme ministers have repeatedly signalled to schools that they want to see permanent exclusion rates falling .
in the early years of the labour government , targets to reduce the number of permanent exclusions were set , but later dropped .

a spokesman for the department of children , schools and families said the figures suggested more schools were using short suspensions as a way of clamping down on misbehaviour before it escalates into something that requires a permanent expulsion .
" head teachers have our full support to permanently exclude pupils where their behaviour warrants it and we trust their judgement to decide what sanctions will work best for the individuals and the school .
" we have reinforced this by giving teachers statutory powers to impose disciplinary sanctions on badly-behaved pupils .
" contrary to popular myth permanent exclusions are not routinely overturned . "
she added that only 100 pupils mounted successful appeals against their exclusion in 2006-07 this was 1.1 % of all permanent exclusions this year . "
nobody wants a permanent exclusion " mick brookes national association of head teachers martin ward , deputy general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , said : " the figures do seem to be symptomatic of overly scrupulous efforts to avoid permanent exclusions which of course nobody wants , but in some cases things drag on for too long before something is done about the situation . "
he added that it was hard to imagine that a child being excluded 10 or even five times in a single year was a satisfactory situation for anybody .
" clearly what 's needed there is a better referral system so the child in question can have some very intensive work with them .
" in a way it would be better to permanently exclude them so this can happen , " mr ward added .
but general secretary of the national association of head teachers mick brookes said a 13 % drop in the number of permanent exclusions was a positive step .

the number of pupils suspended 10 times or more in a year more than doubled between 2004 and 2007 , while permanent exclusions fell by 13 % .
the tories , who revealed the figures , say it is because head teachers ' hands are tied over long-term exclusions .
the government says that schools are reducing low-level disruption .
the department for children , schools and families figures show that the number of permanent exclusions fell 13 % from 9,990 to 8,680 over the four years to 2007 .
repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need nick gibb shadow schools minister tackling disruptive pupils at the same time the number of pupils given repeat suspensions grew markedly .
the number of those given five or more fixed-term exclusions in a year increased by 50 % from 9,090 to 14,850 .
while the number of those excluded on 10 occasions or more in a single year increased two and a half times from 310 to 830 .
and some 17,400 more pupils were suspended more than once in the year 2006-07 than in 2003-04 , when 71,370 pupils were excluded for a fixed term .
shadow schools minister nick gibb , who highlighted the figures , said senior teaching staff were being hampered by parents ' right to challenge decisions through an independent appeals panel .
he said : " very often those appeal panels overturn these expulsions and these children return back to the schools " .
he added : " the huge growth in repeat suspensions is a result of the government tying the hands of head teachers to exclude .
" the government 's approach to discipline in schools is a complete mess .
" repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need to get back on the straight and narrow .
" heads need to be free to exclude disruptive and violent pupils without being second guessed or penalised for doing so . "

a spokesman for the department of children , schools and families said the figures suggested more schools were using short suspensions as a way of clamping down on misbehaviour before it escalates into something that requires a permanent expulsion .
" head teachers have our full support to permanently exclude pupils where their behaviour warrants it and we trust their judgement to decide what sanctions will work best for the individuals and the school .
" we have reinforced this by giving teachers statutory powers to impose disciplinary sanctions on badly-behaved pupils .
" contrary to popular myth permanent exclusions are not routinely overturned . "
she added that only 100 pupils mounted successful appeals against their exclusion in 2006-07 this was 1.1 % of all permanent exclusions this year .

"
he added that it was hard to imagine that a child being excluded 10 or even five times in a single year was a satisfactory situation for anybody .
" clearly what 's needed there is a better referral system so the child in question can have some very intensive work with them .
" in a way it would be better to permanently exclude them so this can happen , " mr ward added .
but general secretary of the national association of head teachers mick brookes said a 13 % drop in the number of permanent exclusions was a positive step .
" nobody wants a permanent exclusion .
and if we are finding other ways to deal with the problem providing that 's not damaging other children 's education then that is a good thing . "

the number of pupils suspended 10 times or more in a year more than doubled between 2004 and 2007 , while permanent exclusions fell by 13 % .
the tories , who revealed the figures , say it is because head teachers ' hands are tied over long-term exclusions .
the government says that schools are reducing low-level disruption .
the department for children , schools and families figures show that the number of permanent exclusions fell 13 % from 9,990 to 8,680 over the four years to 2007 .
repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need nick gibb shadow schools minister tackling disruptive pupils at the same time the number of pupils given repeat suspensions grew markedly .
the number of those given five or more fixed-term exclusions in a year increased by 50 % from 9,090 to 14,850 .
while the number of those excluded on 10 occasions or more in a single year increased two and a half times from 310 to 830 .
and some 17,400 more pupils were suspended more than once in the year 2006-07 than in 2003-04 , when 71,370 pupils were excluded for a fixed term .
shadow schools minister nick gibb , who highlighted the figures , said senior teaching staff were being hampered by parents ' right to challenge decisions through an independent appeals panel .
he said : " very often those appeal panels overturn these expulsions and these children return back to the schools " .
he added : " the huge growth in repeat suspensions is a result of the government tying the hands of head teachers to exclude .

the number of pupils suspended 10 times or more in a year more than doubled between 2004 and 2007 , while permanent exclusions fell by 13 % .
the tories , who revealed the figures , say it is because head teachers ' hands are tied over long-term exclusions .
the government says that schools are reducing low-level disruption .
the department for children , schools and families figures show that the number of permanent exclusions fell 13 % from 9,990 to 8,680 over the four years to 2007 .
repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need nick gibb shadow schools minister tackling disruptive pupils at the same time the number of pupils given repeat suspensions grew markedly .
the number of those given five or more fixed-term exclusions in a year increased by 50 % from 9,090 to 14,850 .
while the number of those excluded on 10 occasions or more in a single year increased two and a half times from 310 to 830 .
and some 17,400 more pupils were suspended more than once in the year 2006-07 than in 2003-04 , when 71,370 pupils were excluded for a fixed term .
shadow schools minister nick gibb , who highlighted the figures , said senior teaching staff were being hampered by parents ' right to challenge decisions through an independent appeals panel .
he said : " very often those appeal panels overturn these expulsions and these children return back to the schools " .
he added : " the huge growth in repeat suspensions is a result of the government tying the hands of head teachers to exclude .
" the government 's approach to discipline in schools is a complete mess .
" repeatedly suspending disruptive children instead of excluding them means they do n't get the specialist help they need to get back on the straight and narrow .
" heads need to be free to exclude disruptive and violent pupils without being second guessed or penalised for doing so . "

more from today programme ministers have repeatedly signalled to schools that they want to see permanent exclusion rates falling .
in the early years of the labour government , targets to reduce the number of permanent exclusions were set , but later dropped .
have your say a youngster with problems at home takes no notice of idle threats but will take note of a positive attitude mike , luton send us your comments in recent years , however , that pressure has eased somewhat with head teachers being given the clear statutory power in 2007 to exclude pupils where they believe it to be necessary .
a spokesman for the department of children , schools and families said the figures suggested more schools were using short suspensions as a way of clamping down on misbehaviour before it escalates into something that requires a permanent expulsion .
" head teachers have our full support to permanently exclude pupils where their behaviour warrants it and we trust their judgement to decide what sanctions will work best for the individuals and the school .
" we have reinforced this by giving teachers statutory powers to impose disciplinary sanctions on badly-behaved pupils .
" contrary to popular myth permanent exclusions are not routinely overturned . "
she added that only 100 pupils mounted successful appeals against their exclusion in 2006-07 this was 1.1 % of all permanent exclusions this year .
nobody wants a permanent exclusion mick brookes national association of head teachers martin ward , deputy general secretary of the association of school and college leaders , said : " the figures do seem to be symptomatic of overly scrupulous efforts to avoid permanent exclusions which of course nobody wants , but in some cases things drag on for too long before something is done about the situation . "
he added that it was hard to imagine that a child being excluded 10 or even five times in a single year was a satisfactory situation for anybody .
" clearly what 's needed there is a better referral system so the child in question can have some very intensive work with them .
" in a way it would be better to permanently exclude them so this can happen , " mr ward added .
but general secretary of the national association of head teachers mick brookes said a 13 % drop in the number of permanent exclusions was a positive step .

the food at the smithstown diner , a small roadside cafe near drogheda , is high on grease - the builders who come here like it that way .
but lately business has dropped .
" it used to be really hectic in here .
now look , " he says , gesturing at rows of empty plastic seats .
the smithstown is popular with what the irish call " breakfast roll man , " building workers in white vans .
this morning , there are just two .
" times are hard , a lot of boys are being let go , " says 40-year-old robert daley , who runs an aluminium fitting business .
" we do mainly big projects - developments of shops , offices and flats , " he says .
" we 're just finishing one , so we 're busy at the moment but there 's nothing else coming up . "
his employee , tony king , nods over his fried eggs and black pudding .
" we 're really feeling the pinch for the first time , because you know there 's nothing else out there .
" in the worst scenario i could go to england - but it 's pretty quiet over there too . "
empty houses tony is not the only person in drogheda talking about working abroad .
a number of people mention australia as a possible destination .
the irish thought their celtic tiger economy had put an end to generations of emigration .
it is not back yet , but the fact that people are talking about it again is a sign of how bad things have got .
ireland is the first country in western europe to officially fall into recession , defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth .
places like drogheda , a commuter town near dublin , have been particularly hit .
during the unprecedented boom years , the population here grew by a third .
now , it is an unemployment black-spot - ringed by new developments with empty , unsold houses .
giles belton has been an estate agent here for 20 years .
he took me to the termon abbey estate to show me the problem .
" this is quite typical of any of the new estates that have been built in the drogheda area , " he says .
" at the height of the market these properties were selling exceptionally well .
a lot of people were buying second , and third , and fourth houses .
there were record breaking prices . "
" now , prices are down by about 30 % . "
the property collapse has combined with the global financial crisis to create what some see as a perfect storm hitting ireland 's banks - whose loan books are groaning with property-related debt .
earlier in october , the government announced a scheme to guarantee deposits in the banks to prevent a run .
pensioner protests now , dublin is buzzing with speculation that this will not be enough - and that a british-style buy-out of top banks will be needed .
it is estimated that irish banks need an additional 10 to 14bn euros and that some may have to merge .
shares in the top four banks have tumbled , but at a banking conference in dublin this week finance minister brian lenihan insisted that buying stakes in the banks was " the last option " .
the government would have trouble paying for it .
last week it unveiled its biggest budget deficit in 20 years - despite the budget including tax rises and cuts in spending on education and health .
the latter included cuts in free health provision for the over 70s , and brought a huge revolt by backbench fianna fail mps that led to a partial , but nonetheless humiliating , climb-down by the government .
prime minister brian cowen had his authority undermined - looking shocked and angry in parliamentary exchanges .
taunted for being " cruel and callous " by the opposition , he shouted back : " you call me callous - call me any names you like .
i 'll continue to provide leadership in the solution of problems " .
but the following day , despite the u-turn , 15,000 pensioners converged on parliament in a day of protest . "
because our economy was so heavily dependent on building , we suffered " dominic hannagan , labour mp according to ray kinsella , professor of banking at university college dublin , it shows that " the financial crisis can and does morph into an economic crisis " .
" the ability to fund public services is undermined .
the government have had to introduce a budget to cope with this astonishing turnaround , and we have n't had to do anything like this for a generation , " he says .
" it 's difficult , it 's protracted , and it 's painful . "
the buskers in drogheda know this .
they line the high street , but do not have many coins in their hats .
local senator dominic hannagan , from the opposition labour party , says the crisis does have international roots , but that the government is also to blame .
" the government relied far too heavily on the building trade .
so when credit became difficult to get , when mortgage rates went up , that area suffered most .
because our economy was so heavily dependent on building , we suffered .
" we 've been telling the government to diversify the economy for years .
they did n't , and now we 're suffering . "
