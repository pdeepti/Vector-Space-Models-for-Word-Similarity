program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .

while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity biodiversity conference ends with mixed results progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth opinion -pipe- 19.05.2008 opinion : the dark side of germany 's environmental record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at this week 's un conference on biodiversity , germany will present itself as a role model when it comes to the environment .
dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seizures of counterfeit toys were at double 2006 levels , and cosmetic and personal care items were up by 264 percent .
overall , the report says , the eu registered 43,000 cases of fake goods seized at the bloc 's borders , up by 17 percent - despite a decline in cases involving fake cigarettes , compact disks and dvds .
commissioner : piracy " a serious threat " the increased number of fakes in sensitive product categories like medicines and toys is " a serious threat to the security and life of our citizens , the consumers , " eu taxation and customs commissioner laszlo kovacs said .
kovacs said the eu plans to work more closely with the countries that are the source of the pirated products .
china contines to head that list , and is responsible for some 60 percent of pirated products overall .
the key source of faked foods and drinks is turkey , while most pirated cosmetics and personal-care products are from georgia , kovacs said .
most fake medicines have their origins in india , the united arab emirates and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .
he can expect pressure from teenage teammate marko marin , a surprise midfield nomination who has made a name for himself on the under-21 team , and patrick helmes , who has earned four caps for germany . struggling midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew can count on ballack in the midfield but other question marks remain while loew and his staff will have to choose among a number of strikers near the top of their game , the coach 's midfield options have put in less inspiring performances with their club teams this season . other than captain michael ballack , whose participation the champions league final with chelsea means he 'll be late to arrive at training on majorca , loew 's preliminary midfield selection does not appear as strong as german sides of the past and - other than 19-year-old marin - contains no real surprises . while it was a slipped disk has put long-time stalwart midfield bernd schneider out of the euro 2008 line-up , it remains unclear if a series of injuries has caused werder bremen captain torsten frings ' performance to slip this season or if the 31-year-old 's career is beginning its decent . either way he and tim borowski , who was substituted into six world cup matches in 2006 and is moving south from bremen to bayern munich next season , can count on making the trip to austria and switzerland while fellow world cup holdover david odonkor 's spot on the national team is less than certain after a shaky season in spain with betis sevilla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini will hope to improve on a lackluster season with bayern since being chosen by juergen klinsmann for the 2006 world cup , stuttgart midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger have seldom left joggi 's good graces and helped him book 15 wins and just two losses in his first 20 games as head coach .
piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seizures of counterfeit toys were at double 2006 levels , and cosmetic and personal care items were up by 264 percent .
overall , the report says , the eu registered 43,000 cases of fake goods seized at the bloc 's borders , up by 17 percent - despite a decline in cases involving fake cigarettes , compact disks and dvds .
commissioner : piracy " a serious threat " the increased number of fakes in sensitive product categories like medicines and toys is " a serious threat to the security and life of our citizens , the consumers , " eu taxation and customs commissioner laszlo kovacs said .
kovacs said the eu plans to work more closely with the countries that are the source of the pirated products .
china contines to head that list , and is responsible for some 60 percent of pirated products overall .
the key source of faked foods and drinks is turkey , while most pirated cosmetics and personal-care products are from georgia , kovacs said .
most fake medicines have their origins in india , the united arab emirates and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : preserving biodiversity biodiversity conference ends with mixed results progress at mid-way point for un biodiversity conference merkel pledges funds at un biodiversity talks merkel warns of extinction threat to life on earth opinion -pipe- 19.05.2008 opinion : the dark side of germany 's environmental record großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at this week 's un conference on biodiversity , germany will present itself as a role model when it comes to the environment .
dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .

gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "

yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .

experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .

" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .

she called the talk " very good " and " fruitful . " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that she and the dalai lama had discussed tibet and its ties with china during the meeting in berlin that lasted about an hour . " i stressed how important peaceful dialogue with china can be , " she told reporters , reiterating berlin 's demands for direct talks between the tibetan representatives and beijing . " the position of the federal government on this issue is very clear and i have stated it again here , " she said . wieczorek-zeul said that she and the tibetan leader had also discussed human rights and the struggle to eradicate poverty .
while she received a white scarf - the dalai lama 's traditional gift - wieczorek-zeul presented the visitor with the un 's millennium goals , " which form the basis of our actions . " the minister added that she thought that it was very important that the dalai lama had expressed his empathy and condolences for the chinese earthquake victims . " i also said that we are suffering , that we feel with the victims and their families and that we 're mourning for them , " she said . it was the highest-level political meeting yet of the dalai lama 's latest tour of western nations , which is likely to keep the spotlight on tibet after deadly anti-chinese unrest rocked the regional capital lhasa in march . chinese protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been welcoming the dalai lama the chinese embassy has objected to the exiled leader 's talks with wieczorek-zeul and accused him of " playing politics " in the run-up to the beijing olympic games in august . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told the press last week . the 1989 nobel peace prize laureate began his five-nation tour in frankfurt last week with an attack on china 's military crackdown on tibetan protestors , accusing beijing of " suppression . " he was met monday in berlin by flag-waving supporters .
a speech at the brandenburg gate later in the day was expected to draw chinese protestors . another diplomatic rift ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met the dalai lama in her office last september the visit comes eight months after a historic meeting between the dalai lama and conservative german chancellor angela merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between beijing and berlin that has only recently begun to heal . merkel will not meet the dalai lama during this visit because she is in latin america , but her outspoken support for his quest for cultural autonomy for tibet and designation of a minister to receive him has caused strife in her fraught ruling coalition . on monday , her spokesman said that merkel " expressly welcomed " talks between the government in beijing and tibetan leaders . " we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .
her aides rejected suggestions that she was meeting the dalai lama , 72 , in a private capacity , saying it was part of her world economic-development job to meet important international figures . after germany , the dalai lama is to head to britain , australia , the united states and france in a three-month tour ending in mid-august , just before the beijing games come to an end . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seizures of counterfeit toys were at double 2006 levels , and cosmetic and personal care items were up by 264 percent .
overall , the report says , the eu registered 43,000 cases of fake goods seized at the bloc 's borders , up by 17 percent - despite a decline in cases involving fake cigarettes , compact disks and dvds .
commissioner : piracy " a serious threat " the increased number of fakes in sensitive product categories like medicines and toys is " a serious threat to the security and life of our citizens , the consumers , " eu taxation and customs commissioner laszlo kovacs said .
kovacs said the eu plans to work more closely with the countries that are the source of the pirated products .
china contines to head that list , and is responsible for some 60 percent of pirated products overall .
the key source of faked foods and drinks is turkey , while most pirated cosmetics and personal-care products are from georgia , kovacs said .
most fake medicines have their origins in india , the united arab emirates and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seizures of counterfeit toys were at double 2006 levels , and cosmetic and personal care items were up by 264 percent .
overall , the report says , the eu registered 43,000 cases of fake goods seized at the bloc 's borders , up by 17 percent - despite a decline in cases involving fake cigarettes , compact disks and dvds .
commissioner : piracy " a serious threat " the increased number of fakes in sensitive product categories like medicines and toys is " a serious threat to the security and life of our citizens , the consumers , " eu taxation and customs commissioner laszlo kovacs said .
kovacs said the eu plans to work more closely with the countries that are the source of the pirated products .

" the ecb president compared the current problems with the oil crisis of the mid-1970s , which damaged economies around the world for years .
speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .
the current problems were " an ongoing very significant market correction , " he said .
' demanding ' economic times asked whether conditions may not be improving , he repeated the same assessment , once again using the key word " ongoing . "
" these are demanding times , challenging times .
we have this accumulation of the oil shock and the food and agro-products shock . "
bankers dealing with the current economic problems should be careful not to trigger the " second-round effects " of spiraling inflation and unemployment , trichet said .
" in the first oil shock , we took the wrong decisions and embarked on second-round effects and tried a high level of inflation for a long period of time , " trichet said .
call for price stability " we created by our own absence of lucidity mass unemployment in europe , when before 1974 we had no mass unemployment . "

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spd secretary general hubertus heil acknowledged that party leaders had met with schwan , who is president of the europa university in frankfurt an der oder .
awaiting statement from koehler but he reiterated the spd position that a candidacy decision would first be made after koehler clarified his stance on a possible second term as president .
preparation for a convention on the future of the spd , slated for may 31 , was at the center of the talks .
leaders from two other political parties , the ruling cdu and the opposition fdp , have called for spd leader kurt beck to publicly endorse koehler for a next term .
koehler is a member of the cdu .
schwan already ran for the job in 2004 , when she lost narrowly to koehler .
some spd politicians have recently begun talking about a new candidacy for schwan .
on sunday , may 18 , she was refusing to comment on the matter .
germans stand behind female presidency according to the mass circulation newspaper bild however , schwan had already signalled to the inner circle of spd leaders that she is ready to run if the party wants her to .
according to a poll by emnid for the bild am sonntag newspaper , 60 percent of germans say it is time for the country to have a female president .
spd party leaders frank-walter steinmeier , peer steinbrueck and andrea nahles were at the meeting , along with party treasurer barbara hendricks and parliamentary party leader peter struck . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cluster bombs have been condemned as they " can not distinguish between military targets and civilians so the humanitarian impact can be extreme , " a statement from the coalition said .
' we need to stop the maiming and killing ' unexploded bomblets cause casualties and injuries years after conflicts end , the statement said .
" we are confident that governments will make the right decision and adopt a ban with no exceptions , no loopholes and no delays .
this is what is needed to do justice to the victims of this weapon and to stop the maiming and killing of generations to come , " cmc coordinator thomas nash said .
pope , bishops favor a ban pope benedict xvi spoke in favor of a comprehensive ban on sunday in the northern italian city of genoa ahead of the conference .
also on sunday , ireland 's catholic bishops called on the irish government to adopt the ban , and catholic organization pax christi told national broadcaster rte it was surprised there was not already a treaty .
advocates of a ban and survivors of cluster bomb attacks were expected to attend the conference , but the main producers of the weapons - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - have said they will stay away . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she called the talk " very good " and " fruitful . " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that she and the dalai lama had discussed tibet and its ties with china during the meeting in berlin that lasted about an hour . " i stressed how important peaceful dialogue with china can be , " she told reporters , reiterating berlin 's demands for direct talks between the tibetan representatives and beijing . " the position of the federal government on this issue is very clear and i have stated it again here , " she said . wieczorek-zeul said that she and the tibetan leader had also discussed human rights and the struggle to eradicate poverty .
while she received a white scarf - the dalai lama 's traditional gift - wieczorek-zeul presented the visitor with the un 's millennium goals , " which form the basis of our actions . " the minister added that she thought that it was very important that the dalai lama had expressed his empathy and condolences for the chinese earthquake victims . " i also said that we are suffering , that we feel with the victims and their families and that we 're mourning for them , " she said . it was the highest-level political meeting yet of the dalai lama 's latest tour of western nations , which is likely to keep the spotlight on tibet after deadly anti-chinese unrest rocked the regional capital lhasa in march . chinese protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been welcoming the dalai lama the chinese embassy has objected to the exiled leader 's talks with wieczorek-zeul and accused him of " playing politics " in the run-up to the beijing olympic games in august . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told the press last week . the 1989 nobel peace prize laureate began his five-nation tour in frankfurt last week with an attack on china 's military crackdown on tibetan protestors , accusing beijing of " suppression . " he was met monday in berlin by flag-waving supporters .
a speech at the brandenburg gate later in the day was expected to draw chinese protestors . another diplomatic rift ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met the dalai lama in her office last september the visit comes eight months after a historic meeting between the dalai lama and conservative german chancellor angela merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between beijing and berlin that has only recently begun to heal . merkel will not meet the dalai lama during this visit because she is in latin america , but her outspoken support for his quest for cultural autonomy for tibet and designation of a minister to receive him has caused strife in her fraught ruling coalition . on monday , her spokesman said that merkel " expressly welcomed " talks between the government in beijing and tibetan leaders . " we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .
her aides rejected suggestions that she was meeting the dalai lama , 72 , in a private capacity , saying it was part of her world economic-development job to meet important international figures . after germany , the dalai lama is to head to britain , australia , the united states and france in a three-month tour ending in mid-august , just before the beijing games come to an end . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she called the talk " very good " and " fruitful . " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that she and the dalai lama had discussed tibet and its ties with china during the meeting in berlin that lasted about an hour . " i stressed how important peaceful dialogue with china can be , " she told reporters , reiterating berlin 's demands for direct talks between the tibetan representatives and beijing . " the position of the federal government on this issue is very clear and i have stated it again here , " she said . wieczorek-zeul said that she and the tibetan leader had also discussed human rights and the struggle to eradicate poverty .
while she received a white scarf - the dalai lama 's traditional gift - wieczorek-zeul presented the visitor with the un 's millennium goals , " which form the basis of our actions . " the minister added that she thought that it was very important that the dalai lama had expressed his empathy and condolences for the chinese earthquake victims . " i also said that we are suffering , that we feel with the victims and their families and that we 're mourning for them , " she said . it was the highest-level political meeting yet of the dalai lama 's latest tour of western nations , which is likely to keep the spotlight on tibet after deadly anti-chinese unrest rocked the regional capital lhasa in march . chinese protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been welcoming the dalai lama the chinese embassy has objected to the exiled leader 's talks with wieczorek-zeul and accused him of " playing politics " in the run-up to the beijing olympic games in august . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told the press last week . the 1989 nobel peace prize laureate began his five-nation tour in frankfurt last week with an attack on china 's military crackdown on tibetan protestors , accusing beijing of " suppression . " he was met monday in berlin by flag-waving supporters .
a speech at the brandenburg gate later in the day was expected to draw chinese protestors . another diplomatic rift ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met the dalai lama in her office last september the visit comes eight months after a historic meeting between the dalai lama and conservative german chancellor angela merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between beijing and berlin that has only recently begun to heal . merkel will not meet the dalai lama during this visit because she is in latin america , but her outspoken support for his quest for cultural autonomy for tibet and designation of a minister to receive him has caused strife in her fraught ruling coalition . on monday , her spokesman said that merkel " expressly welcomed " talks between the government in beijing and tibetan leaders . " we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .
her aides rejected suggestions that she was meeting the dalai lama , 72 , in a private capacity , saying it was part of her world economic-development job to meet important international figures . after germany , the dalai lama is to head to britain , australia , the united states and france in a three-month tour ending in mid-august , just before the beijing games come to an end . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .

" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .

gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "

the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .

food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .

" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .

gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cluster bombs have been condemned as they " can not distinguish between military targets and civilians so the humanitarian impact can be extreme , " a statement from the coalition said .
' we need to stop the maiming and killing ' unexploded bomblets cause casualties and injuries years after conflicts end , the statement said .
" we are confident that governments will make the right decision and adopt a ban with no exceptions , no loopholes and no delays .
this is what is needed to do justice to the victims of this weapon and to stop the maiming and killing of generations to come , " cmc coordinator thomas nash said .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .

cluster bombs have been condemned as they " can not distinguish between military targets and civilians so the humanitarian impact can be extreme , " a statement from the coalition said .
' we need to stop the maiming and killing ' unexploded bomblets cause casualties and injuries years after conflicts end , the statement said .
" we are confident that governments will make the right decision and adopt a ban with no exceptions , no loopholes and no delays .
this is what is needed to do justice to the victims of this weapon and to stop the maiming and killing of generations to come , " cmc coordinator thomas nash said .
pope , bishops favor a ban pope benedict xvi spoke in favor of a comprehensive ban on sunday in the northern italian city of genoa ahead of the conference .
also on sunday , ireland 's catholic bishops called on the irish government to adopt the ban , and catholic organization pax christi told national broadcaster rte it was surprised there was not already a treaty .
advocates of a ban and survivors of cluster bomb attacks were expected to attend the conference , but the main producers of the weapons - the united states , israel , china , russia , india and pakistan - have said they will stay away . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .
he can expect pressure from teenage teammate marko marin , a surprise midfield nomination who has made a name for himself on the under-21 team , and patrick helmes , who has earned four caps for germany . struggling midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew can count on ballack in the midfield but other question marks remain while loew and his staff will have to choose among a number of strikers near the top of their game , the coach 's midfield options have put in less inspiring performances with their club teams this season . other than captain michael ballack , whose participation the champions league final with chelsea means he 'll be late to arrive at training on majorca , loew 's preliminary midfield selection does not appear as strong as german sides of the past and - other than 19-year-old marin - contains no real surprises . while it was a slipped disk has put long-time stalwart midfield bernd schneider out of the euro 2008 line-up , it remains unclear if a series of injuries has caused werder bremen captain torsten frings ' performance to slip this season or if the 31-year-old 's career is beginning its decent . either way he and tim borowski , who was substituted into six world cup matches in 2006 and is moving south from bremen to bayern munich next season , can count on making the trip to austria and switzerland while fellow world cup holdover david odonkor 's spot on the national team is less than certain after a shaky season in spain with betis sevilla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini will hope to improve on a lackluster season with bayern since being chosen by juergen klinsmann for the 2006 world cup , stuttgart midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger have seldom left joggi 's good graces and helped him book 15 wins and just two losses in his first 20 games as head coach .
piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seizures of counterfeit toys were at double 2006 levels , and cosmetic and personal care items were up by 264 percent .
overall , the report says , the eu registered 43,000 cases of fake goods seized at the bloc 's borders , up by 17 percent - despite a decline in cases involving fake cigarettes , compact disks and dvds .
commissioner : piracy " a serious threat " the increased number of fakes in sensitive product categories like medicines and toys is " a serious threat to the security and life of our citizens , the consumers , " eu taxation and customs commissioner laszlo kovacs said .
kovacs said the eu plans to work more closely with the countries that are the source of the pirated products .
china contines to head that list , and is responsible for some 60 percent of pirated products overall .
the key source of faked foods and drinks is turkey , while most pirated cosmetics and personal-care products are from georgia , kovacs said .

while she received a white scarf - the dalai lama 's traditional gift - wieczorek-zeul presented the visitor with the un 's millennium goals , " which form the basis of our actions . " the minister added that she thought that it was very important that the dalai lama had expressed his empathy and condolences for the chinese earthquake victims . " i also said that we are suffering , that we feel with the victims and their families and that we 're mourning for them , " she said . it was the highest-level political meeting yet of the dalai lama 's latest tour of western nations , which is likely to keep the spotlight on tibet after deadly anti-chinese unrest rocked the regional capital lhasa in march . chinese protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been welcoming the dalai lama the chinese embassy has objected to the exiled leader 's talks with wieczorek-zeul and accused him of " playing politics " in the run-up to the beijing olympic games in august . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told the press last week . the 1989 nobel peace prize laureate began his five-nation tour in frankfurt last week with an attack on china 's military crackdown on tibetan protestors , accusing beijing of " suppression . " he was met monday in berlin by flag-waving supporters .
a speech at the brandenburg gate later in the day was expected to draw chinese protestors . another diplomatic rift ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met the dalai lama in her office last september the visit comes eight months after a historic meeting between the dalai lama and conservative german chancellor angela merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between beijing and berlin that has only recently begun to heal . merkel will not meet the dalai lama during this visit because she is in latin america , but her outspoken support for his quest for cultural autonomy for tibet and designation of a minister to receive him has caused strife in her fraught ruling coalition . on monday , her spokesman said that merkel " expressly welcomed " talks between the government in beijing and tibetan leaders . " we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .
her aides rejected suggestions that she was meeting the dalai lama , 72 , in a private capacity , saying it was part of her world economic-development job to meet important international figures . after germany , the dalai lama is to head to britain , australia , the united states and france in a three-month tour ending in mid-august , just before the beijing games come to an end . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .

piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ecb president compared the current problems with the oil crisis of the mid-1970s , which damaged economies around the world for years .
speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .
the current problems were " an ongoing very significant market correction , " he said .
' demanding ' economic times asked whether conditions may not be improving , he repeated the same assessment , once again using the key word " ongoing . "
" these are demanding times , challenging times .
we have this accumulation of the oil shock and the food and agro-products shock . "
bankers dealing with the current economic problems should be careful not to trigger the " second-round effects " of spiraling inflation and unemployment , trichet said .
" in the first oil shock , we took the wrong decisions and embarked on second-round effects and tried a high level of inflation for a long period of time , " trichet said .
call for price stability " we created by our own absence of lucidity mass unemployment in europe , when before 1974 we had no mass unemployment . "
" price stability , and credibility in price stability , in the medium term , is the best way to have a high level of sustainable growth and sustainable job creation , " the ecb head said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .

" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .

she called the talk " very good " and " fruitful .

" we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .

" the ecb president compared the current problems with the oil crisis of the mid-1970s , which damaged economies around the world for years .
speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european championships -pipe- 19.05.2008 midfield gaps open in front of indecisive loew großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i will find a way to balance this team " ahead of the european championships , joachim loew faces a task that germany coaches have n't had to consider for some time : how to build a solid midfield .
the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .
he can expect pressure from teenage teammate marko marin , a surprise midfield nomination who has made a name for himself on the under-21 team , and patrick helmes , who has earned four caps for germany . struggling midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew can count on ballack in the midfield but other question marks remain while loew and his staff will have to choose among a number of strikers near the top of their game , the coach 's midfield options have put in less inspiring performances with their club teams this season . other than captain michael ballack , whose participation the champions league final with chelsea means he 'll be late to arrive at training on majorca , loew 's preliminary midfield selection does not appear as strong as german sides of the past and - other than 19-year-old marin - contains no real surprises . while it was a slipped disk has put long-time stalwart midfield bernd schneider out of the euro 2008 line-up , it remains unclear if a series of injuries has caused werder bremen captain torsten frings ' performance to slip this season or if the 31-year-old 's career is beginning its decent . either way he and tim borowski , who was substituted into six world cup matches in 2006 and is moving south from bremen to bayern munich next season , can count on making the trip to austria and switzerland while fellow world cup holdover david odonkor 's spot on the national team is less than certain after a shaky season in spain with betis sevilla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini will hope to improve on a lackluster season with bayern since being chosen by juergen klinsmann for the 2006 world cup , stuttgart midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger have seldom left joggi 's good graces and helped him book 15 wins and just two losses in his first 20 games as head coach .
piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .
he can expect pressure from teenage teammate marko marin , a surprise midfield nomination who has made a name for himself on the under-21 team , and patrick helmes , who has earned four caps for germany . struggling midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew can count on ballack in the midfield but other question marks remain while loew and his staff will have to choose among a number of strikers near the top of their game , the coach 's midfield options have put in less inspiring performances with their club teams this season . other than captain michael ballack , whose participation the champions league final with chelsea means he 'll be late to arrive at training on majorca , loew 's preliminary midfield selection does not appear as strong as german sides of the past and - other than 19-year-old marin - contains no real surprises . while it was a slipped disk has put long-time stalwart midfield bernd schneider out of the euro 2008 line-up , it remains unclear if a series of injuries has caused werder bremen captain torsten frings ' performance to slip this season or if the 31-year-old 's career is beginning its decent . either way he and tim borowski , who was substituted into six world cup matches in 2006 and is moving south from bremen to bayern munich next season , can count on making the trip to austria and switzerland while fellow world cup holdover david odonkor 's spot on the national team is less than certain after a shaky season in spain with betis sevilla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini will hope to improve on a lackluster season with bayern since being chosen by juergen klinsmann for the 2006 world cup , stuttgart midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger have seldom left joggi 's good graces and helped him book 15 wins and just two losses in his first 20 games as head coach .
piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .

" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .

one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she called the talk " very good " and " fruitful . " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that she and the dalai lama had discussed tibet and its ties with china during the meeting in berlin that lasted about an hour . " i stressed how important peaceful dialogue with china can be , " she told reporters , reiterating berlin 's demands for direct talks between the tibetan representatives and beijing . " the position of the federal government on this issue is very clear and i have stated it again here , " she said . wieczorek-zeul said that she and the tibetan leader had also discussed human rights and the struggle to eradicate poverty .
while she received a white scarf - the dalai lama 's traditional gift - wieczorek-zeul presented the visitor with the un 's millennium goals , " which form the basis of our actions . " the minister added that she thought that it was very important that the dalai lama had expressed his empathy and condolences for the chinese earthquake victims . " i also said that we are suffering , that we feel with the victims and their families and that we 're mourning for them , " she said . it was the highest-level political meeting yet of the dalai lama 's latest tour of western nations , which is likely to keep the spotlight on tibet after deadly anti-chinese unrest rocked the regional capital lhasa in march . chinese protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been welcoming the dalai lama the chinese embassy has objected to the exiled leader 's talks with wieczorek-zeul and accused him of " playing politics " in the run-up to the beijing olympic games in august . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told the press last week . the 1989 nobel peace prize laureate began his five-nation tour in frankfurt last week with an attack on china 's military crackdown on tibetan protestors , accusing beijing of " suppression . " he was met monday in berlin by flag-waving supporters .
a speech at the brandenburg gate later in the day was expected to draw chinese protestors . another diplomatic rift ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met the dalai lama in her office last september the visit comes eight months after a historic meeting between the dalai lama and conservative german chancellor angela merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between beijing and berlin that has only recently begun to heal . merkel will not meet the dalai lama during this visit because she is in latin america , but her outspoken support for his quest for cultural autonomy for tibet and designation of a minister to receive him has caused strife in her fraught ruling coalition . on monday , her spokesman said that merkel " expressly welcomed " talks between the government in beijing and tibetan leaders . " we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .
her aides rejected suggestions that she was meeting the dalai lama , 72 , in a private capacity , saying it was part of her world economic-development job to meet important international figures . after germany , the dalai lama is to head to britain , australia , the united states and france in a three-month tour ending in mid-august , just before the beijing games come to an end . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .

a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .
he can expect pressure from teenage teammate marko marin , a surprise midfield nomination who has made a name for himself on the under-21 team , and patrick helmes , who has earned four caps for germany . struggling midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew can count on ballack in the midfield but other question marks remain while loew and his staff will have to choose among a number of strikers near the top of their game , the coach 's midfield options have put in less inspiring performances with their club teams this season . other than captain michael ballack , whose participation the champions league final with chelsea means he 'll be late to arrive at training on majorca , loew 's preliminary midfield selection does not appear as strong as german sides of the past and - other than 19-year-old marin - contains no real surprises . while it was a slipped disk has put long-time stalwart midfield bernd schneider out of the euro 2008 line-up , it remains unclear if a series of injuries has caused werder bremen captain torsten frings ' performance to slip this season or if the 31-year-old 's career is beginning its decent . either way he and tim borowski , who was substituted into six world cup matches in 2006 and is moving south from bremen to bayern munich next season , can count on making the trip to austria and switzerland while fellow world cup holdover david odonkor 's spot on the national team is less than certain after a shaky season in spain with betis sevilla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini will hope to improve on a lackluster season with bayern since being chosen by juergen klinsmann for the 2006 world cup , stuttgart midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger have seldom left joggi 's good graces and helped him book 15 wins and just two losses in his first 20 games as head coach .
piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .
but they 're going to face stiff competition from ambitious second-division strikers looking to earn a position or make their way back on the national side . with 66 caps to his name , oliver neuville is the most experienced of the trio of forwards gunning for a spot on loew 's list .
he can expect pressure from teenage teammate marko marin , a surprise midfield nomination who has made a name for himself on the under-21 team , and patrick helmes , who has earned four caps for germany . struggling midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew can count on ballack in the midfield but other question marks remain while loew and his staff will have to choose among a number of strikers near the top of their game , the coach 's midfield options have put in less inspiring performances with their club teams this season . other than captain michael ballack , whose participation the champions league final with chelsea means he 'll be late to arrive at training on majorca , loew 's preliminary midfield selection does not appear as strong as german sides of the past and - other than 19-year-old marin - contains no real surprises . while it was a slipped disk has put long-time stalwart midfield bernd schneider out of the euro 2008 line-up , it remains unclear if a series of injuries has caused werder bremen captain torsten frings ' performance to slip this season or if the 31-year-old 's career is beginning its decent . either way he and tim borowski , who was substituted into six world cup matches in 2006 and is moving south from bremen to bayern munich next season , can count on making the trip to austria and switzerland while fellow world cup holdover david odonkor 's spot on the national team is less than certain after a shaky season in spain with betis sevilla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweini will hope to improve on a lackluster season with bayern since being chosen by juergen klinsmann for the 2006 world cup , stuttgart midfielder thomas hitzlsperger and bayern 's bastian schweinsteiger have seldom left joggi 's good graces and helped him book 15 wins and just two losses in his first 20 games as head coach .
piotr trochowski , on the other hand , will have to improve on the single goal he scored in the german league this season to retain a ticket to austria . loew made clear that first-rate performances in the bundesliga convinced him that jermaine jones and simon rolfes , called germany 's best field player by kicker sports magazine , deserved a second look before he announced his final roster . defensive gaps closed in goal a foot operation was n't enough to keep loew from nominating workhorse christoph metzelder , despite the central defender 's recent return to real madrid 's starting 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main goalkeeping question is about who will be on the bench most at home on the left side , bayern 's philipp lahm has proven capable of filling in wherever loew needs him , and could potentially slide into a central position to anchor an otherwise shaky defense with per mertesacker if needed . marcel jansen and clemens fritz provide the team with quickness on the flanks but , like central defender arne friedrich , have wobbled in past when dressed in germany 's black , red and gold jerseys . with just two appearances for germany , 25-year-old heiko westermann is the only recent arrival on the back line , but his aggressive nature - he scored four goals for schalke this season - makes him a good fit in germany 's offensive-minded defense . while no one in germany was surprised when loew nominated jens lehmann as his first choice between the posts , the exclusion of long-time backup goalie timo hildebrand in favor of robert enke and newcomer rene adler did catch many off guard . when presenting the team loew said the decision to leave out hildebrand had been particularly difficult , but he would not be drawn on whether it was the end of the former stuttgart keepers ' international career . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ecb president compared the current problems with the oil crisis of the mid-1970s , which damaged economies around the world for years .
speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .
the current problems were " an ongoing very significant market correction , " he said .
' demanding ' economic times asked whether conditions may not be improving , he repeated the same assessment , once again using the key word " ongoing . "
" these are demanding times , challenging times .
we have this accumulation of the oil shock and the food and agro-products shock . "
bankers dealing with the current economic problems should be careful not to trigger the " second-round effects " of spiraling inflation and unemployment , trichet said .
" in the first oil shock , we took the wrong decisions and embarked on second-round effects and tried a high level of inflation for a long period of time , " trichet said .
call for price stability " we created by our own absence of lucidity mass unemployment in europe , when before 1974 we had no mass unemployment . "
" price stability , and credibility in price stability , in the medium term , is the best way to have a high level of sustainable growth and sustainable job creation , " the ecb head said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .
the current problems were " an ongoing very significant market correction , " he said .
' demanding ' economic times asked whether conditions may not be improving , he repeated the same assessment , once again using the key word " ongoing . "
" these are demanding times , challenging times .
we have this accumulation of the oil shock and the food and agro-products shock . "
bankers dealing with the current economic problems should be careful not to trigger the " second-round effects " of spiraling inflation and unemployment , trichet said .
" in the first oil shock , we took the wrong decisions and embarked on second-round effects and tried a high level of inflation for a long period of time , " trichet said .
call for price stability " we created by our own absence of lucidity mass unemployment in europe , when before 1974 we had no mass unemployment . "
" price stability , and credibility in price stability , in the medium term , is the best way to have a high level of sustainable growth and sustainable job creation , " the ecb head said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she called the talk " very good " and " fruitful . " german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said that she and the dalai lama had discussed tibet and its ties with china during the meeting in berlin that lasted about an hour . " i stressed how important peaceful dialogue with china can be , " she told reporters , reiterating berlin 's demands for direct talks between the tibetan representatives and beijing . " the position of the federal government on this issue is very clear and i have stated it again here , " she said . wieczorek-zeul said that she and the tibetan leader had also discussed human rights and the struggle to eradicate poverty .
while she received a white scarf - the dalai lama 's traditional gift - wieczorek-zeul presented the visitor with the un 's millennium goals , " which form the basis of our actions . " the minister added that she thought that it was very important that the dalai lama had expressed his empathy and condolences for the chinese earthquake victims . " i also said that we are suffering , that we feel with the victims and their families and that we 're mourning for them , " she said . it was the highest-level political meeting yet of the dalai lama 's latest tour of western nations , which is likely to keep the spotlight on tibet after deadly anti-chinese unrest rocked the regional capital lhasa in march . chinese protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have been welcoming the dalai lama the chinese embassy has objected to the exiled leader 's talks with wieczorek-zeul and accused him of " playing politics " in the run-up to the beijing olympic games in august . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told the press last week . the 1989 nobel peace prize laureate began his five-nation tour in frankfurt last week with an attack on china 's military crackdown on tibetan protestors , accusing beijing of " suppression . " he was met monday in berlin by flag-waving supporters .
a speech at the brandenburg gate later in the day was expected to draw chinese protestors . another diplomatic rift ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met the dalai lama in her office last september the visit comes eight months after a historic meeting between the dalai lama and conservative german chancellor angela merkel caused a deep diplomatic rift between beijing and berlin that has only recently begun to heal . merkel will not meet the dalai lama during this visit because she is in latin america , but her outspoken support for his quest for cultural autonomy for tibet and designation of a minister to receive him has caused strife in her fraught ruling coalition . on monday , her spokesman said that merkel " expressly welcomed " talks between the government in beijing and tibetan leaders . " we do not believe that today 's meeting will have a negative impact on the dialogue forming between china and the dalai lama 's representatives on developments in tibet and perhaps also in neighboring countries , " he said . angry colleagues foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who disapproved of the reception given to the dalai lama last year , has declined to meet him . steinmeier , a social democrat , is reported to be furious that fellow party member wieczorek-zeul failed to inform colleagues of her plans . the minister referred to the row on monday , telling reporters that she had discussed the spd 's concerns with party leader kurt beck .
her aides rejected suggestions that she was meeting the dalai lama , 72 , in a private capacity , saying it was part of her world economic-development job to meet important international figures . after germany , the dalai lama is to head to britain , australia , the united states and france in a three-month tour ending in mid-august , just before the beijing games come to an end . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .

seizures of counterfeit toys were at double 2006 levels , and cosmetic and personal care items were up by 264 percent .
overall , the report says , the eu registered 43,000 cases of fake goods seized at the bloc 's borders , up by 17 percent - despite a decline in cases involving fake cigarettes , compact disks and dvds .
commissioner : piracy " a serious threat " the increased number of fakes in sensitive product categories like medicines and toys is " a serious threat to the security and life of our citizens , the consumers , " eu taxation and customs commissioner laszlo kovacs said .
kovacs said the eu plans to work more closely with the countries that are the source of the pirated products .
china contines to head that list , and is responsible for some 60 percent of pirated products overall .
the key source of faked foods and drinks is turkey , while most pirated cosmetics and personal-care products are from georgia , kovacs said .
most fake medicines have their origins in india , the united arab emirates and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .

gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team 's traditional motor is showing signs of sputtering . aware that the trip to the european championships this summer will be the biggest test in his two-year tenure at the helm of the german men 's soccer team , joachim loew started his preparations on monday , may 19 , with more than a week of double sessions for 26 germany players . after cruising through the qualifying stages to become the first team with a ticket to the finals , which run from june 7-29 , three-time euro title holders germany are among the favorites to win the 16-team tournament . " now the serious work begins for us of choosing a team for the european championships , " loew said when he announced the team on may 16 .
" we want to exhaust all possibilities in the enlarged squad and we have the luxury of a training camp to scrutinize players .
we need to see how players cope under pressure . " unlike the pressure of taking the pitch against germany 's group b opponents poland , croatia and austria , the players will face more difficult competition from their german teammates as three of the 26 players training on the spanish island of majorca will be cut from the roster by may 28 . spoilt for choice up front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose hope to continue working together for germany this summer a total of six strikers are taking part in nine-day training session leaving loew with the decision of which to put up front during the tournament . world cup veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski as well as relative national team newcomer mario gomez and on-again-off-again kevin kuranyi look to have secured spots in the center circle for germany .

" the ecb president compared the current problems with the oil crisis of the mid-1970s , which damaged economies around the world for years .
speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .
the current problems were " an ongoing very significant market correction , " he said .
' demanding ' economic times asked whether conditions may not be improving , he repeated the same assessment , once again using the key word " ongoing . "
" these are demanding times , challenging times .
we have this accumulation of the oil shock and the food and agro-products shock . "
bankers dealing with the current economic problems should be careful not to trigger the " second-round effects " of spiraling inflation and unemployment , trichet said .
" in the first oil shock , we took the wrong decisions and embarked on second-round effects and tried a high level of inflation for a long period of time , " trichet said .
call for price stability " we created by our own absence of lucidity mass unemployment in europe , when before 1974 we had no mass unemployment . "
" price stability , and credibility in price stability , in the medium term , is the best way to have a high level of sustainable growth and sustainable job creation , " the ecb head said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.05.2008 get-up-and-go polish entrepreneurs discover germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish entrepreneurs are forcing towns such as pasewalk in eastern germany to spruce up a growing number of polish entrepreneurs are setting up firms across the border in eastern germany , reviving areas still struggling with the legacy of the collapse of communism - and challenging stereotypes . forty-year-old jaroslaw wieczorek is one of the polish investors who has taken the plunge .
already the owner of one factory in his home city of poznan , he decided in 2006 to found a second in the small german town of pasewalk , some 270 kilometers -lrb- 170 miles -rrb- to the north-west .
it went into production less than a year later , making specialized tools and equipment for car manufacturers .
given germany 's reputation for precision engineering , some might think this is a case of carrying coals to newcastle .
but there are a number of benefits to having a german base as well as a polish one .
" as a german firm it 's easier to sell my products , there are some customers who only want products made in germany , " said wieczorek .
attempting to play on a level playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has more to offer than good plumbers it is also easier to get a decent price .
many german businesses have outdated ideas about the cost of living in poland .
" they think that everything is 20 percent cheaper and that they should be able to get things for 20 percent less , but it 's not the case , " the businessman complained .
when it comes to buying products from german companies , having a base inside the country means that he can cut out the middleman when acquiring components for his firm in poznan .
many german wholesalers and manufacturers do not deal directly with their polish customers , but are represented by agencies across the border .
while many german firms may have chosen to relocate abroad to save labor costs , wages in western poland are only marginally lower than in the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , which borders poland .
wieczorek 's firm , romag nord , has already taken on 18 german workers .
and he has plans to more than double the size of his workforce .
in the depopulated border region , there is also no shortage of reasonably priced premises to buy or rent .
this year , wieczorek is planning to buy one of the two former slaughterhouse buildings that he currently rents in pasewalk .
later , he intends to build a custom-built plant on undeveloped land .
" for us it 's cheap here .
poznan is a city .
land prices on industrial estates there are much higher , " he said .
attracting city poles to rural eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border controls between germany and poland were abolished in late 2007 the price of real estate in loeckwitz , 25 kilometers away , is also creating a lot of interest on the other side of the border .
some 200 of the town 's 3,000 inhabitants are polish citizens .
project manager jan rybski moved here a year ago from szczecin .
he is currently overseeing the development of a " german-polish settlement " targeted at middle-class poles from nearby metropolitan areas as well as german retirees looking for the quiet life .
rybski and his wife first thought of moving to loecknitz when their son started attending the german-polish high school there .
at the same time , the businessman read about a plot of land that had been designated for development .
the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place four years before , but only two houses had been built .
" i thought that it would have been developed long ago .
in szczecin , land and house prices have exploded over the last year .
we can offer prices that are 20 percent lower than they are just a few kilometers away in poland , “ said rybski .
breathing new life into a graying area bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 100 poles attend the bilingual german-polish school in loecknitz the rybskis are not alone in wanting their children to go to the high school in loecknitz , but striving to spare them the one or two hour-journey .
the project manager , who works together with a german construction company in mecklenburg-western pomerania , emphasized the benefit for the region as a whole , and for loecknitz itself .
" if we can attract 20 new polish families with several children , that is an important economic factor .
some of them will most certainly also set up businesses .
this is one of the few places in mecklenburg-western pomerania where the population is growing .
we are ensuring the future of a micro-region , " he said .
like wieczorek , the polish project manager only has praise for the support that he has received from german municipal and regional authorities and for the surprising lack of red tape .
faced with the specter of school and kindergarden closures and unemployment rates of around 18 percent , local politicians have been getting on their bikes and drumming up support in neighboring poland .
more attractive tax breaks and subsidies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has also given rise to support for the neo-nazi npd in the region favorable german tax allowances and business subsidies are aiding the momentum .
according to adam grendziak , from the haus der wirtschaft , a german-polish business center in szczecin , many self-employed poles are also attracted to base their businesses in germany because tax allowances are more generous .
as a result , the number of poles going west has grown in recent years .
along with the low cost of land , engineering firm owner jaroslaw wieczorek was first attracted to the region because germany 's regional structures meant it was less complicated and time-consuming to access eu funds than in centralized poland .
thanks to a mix of eu grants and german support for small businesses , he will be able to reclaim some 50 percent of the 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 930,000 -rrb- that he has invested so far .
over the next three years , he aims to plough in an additional 1.6 million euros .
getting the right staff has , however , turned out to be more of a problem than the polish entrepreneur anticipated .
just as poland has seen a mass exodus of qualified workers since joining the eu in 2004 , many of this area 's young and ambitious relocated to western germany long ago .
many of those left behind have been out of the job market for years .
as a result , their skills are out of date .
there are other problems .
at the beginning of this year , there were a number of reports of buildings in loecknitz being daubed with anti-polish slogans and the tires of polish residents ' cars being slashed .
in the 2006 regional elections , 18 percent of the town 's electorate voted for the far-right npd .
while jan rybski is eager to downplay this as a protest vote , the get-up-and-go poles do seem to be the source of some resentment .
xenophobia is a problem in this region of germany , according to rainer petzold , managing director of the german and polish business development society .
the consultant , who is based in the border town of frankfurt / oder , has long been advising business people in germany and poland about the opportunities on the other side of the frontier .
his enthusiasm that the areas should grow closer together is not shared by everyone .
" people here are afraid that something could be taken away from them .
their image of the poles is one that was current in the media in the 1970s and 1980s .
we will have to make sure that the frontier in people 's minds disappears , " he said . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ecb president compared the current problems with the oil crisis of the mid-1970s , which damaged economies around the world for years .
speaking to the bbc on monday , may 19 , he warned that if central banks allowed inflation to run out of control , as they did in the 1970s , they may fuel mass unemployment .
price stability must remain the dominant target over the medium and long term , trichet said .
the current problems were " an ongoing very significant market correction , " he said .
' demanding ' economic times asked whether conditions may not be improving , he repeated the same assessment , once again using the key word " ongoing . "
" these are demanding times , challenging times .
we have this accumulation of the oil shock and the food and agro-products shock . "
bankers dealing with the current economic problems should be careful not to trigger the " second-round effects " of spiraling inflation and unemployment , trichet said .
" in the first oil shock , we took the wrong decisions and embarked on second-round effects and tried a high level of inflation for a long period of time , " trichet said .
call for price stability " we created by our own absence of lucidity mass unemployment in europe , when before 1974 we had no mass unemployment . "
" price stability , and credibility in price stability , in the medium term , is the best way to have a high level of sustainable growth and sustainable job creation , " the ecb head said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's thorsten schäfer says that there 's really not much to brag about . lynx , salmon , wolf , sea eagle , beaver , bear and many more - the list of animals that have returned to germany during the last couple of years is impressive .
it seems as if nature has recovered quickly .
but appearances are deceiving : extinction continues .
while every wolf appearance makes headlines , the decline of skylark and common swift does n't .
there are some success stories , but not enough . waste of space , which is rarely talked about , is partially to blame .
a populous state that continues to build on 105 hectares -lrb- 260 acres -rrb- every day can not preserve habitats in a way that it should - and likes to claim it does .
one should really talk about states in this context , since germany 's federal states are the main players in the country 's environmental politics .
they decide locally which areas to focus on and where the money will go . money 's the touchy subject .
without a doubt , germany spends more on protecting the environment than many other countries .
no one can say , though , whether the money 's used efficiently , where it goes and how much is invested in total .
individual federal states keep tally of their expenditures to protect the environment in totally different ways .
some do this meticulously , but most do not .
even if budget items get the same name , they include very different things depending on the state .
there 's very little transparency , but a lot of chaos .
a survey of german state governments by magazine geo recently showed how contradictory expenditures to protect the environment really are . the financial chaos comes with a price tag : it 's impossible to compare what states are doing , let alone identify role models or show where money is wasted .
in switzerland , expenditures to protect the environment are an important early indicator when it comes to policy , which is why they 're recorded systematically on all levels .
in germany , states have no interest in coordination .
no one wants to lower their guard .
the environment ministers do n't seem to care that this is really about how tax money is used to protect the public good . one gets the impression that the states care much less about environmental protection than they frequently say .
sure , the federal and state governments have had to save money everywhere , with environmental policies being hit hardest : between 1996 and 2007 , total environmental protection expenditures fell by 22 percent , according to a report by the german advisory council on the environment .
conservation was cut drastically .
almost all state administrations have massively cut personnel - especially in the case of north rhine-westphalia . there are also legal problems : by relinquishing some authority - for example as far as conservation is concerned - the federal government has regained authority in other areas from the states in connection with germany 's recent federal reform .
experts now complain that germany 's conservation laws have become denser and less transparent than any rainforest .
the federal conservation law , which was adopted in 2002 , did n't help either .
it says , for example , that 10 percent of a state 's total area should be protected .
this is n't binding , however , and states themselves decide where to set their priorities . things were clearer when it came to implementing the eu 's nature 2000 guidelines , which were adopted in 1992 .
every member state has to allocate areas for an eu-wide network of protected areas .
germany finally fulfilled its duty to report areas at the beginning of the year .
but the eu repeatedly had to drag germany in front of the european court of justice because germany 's federal states did n't do their homework and failed to allocate land for this . german state governments should get detention for their lack of will to cooperate in many areas and obvious contradictions between what they say and what they do .
but politicians will pat each other 's backs during the un conference on biodiversity - including hymns of praise from one state representative to another . if germany wants to live up to its claims on environmental policy , it would be better to get working .
credibility is something that 's quickly lost - and germany 's states are currently doing their part to speed up that process . thorsten schaefer covers environmental issues for dw-world.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke at the start of a two-week united nations conference on the topic . protecting animal and plant life from climate change and pollution should be at the top of the global agenda , gabriel said at the conference in bonn on monday .
extinctions are going forward at a rate anywhere from 100 times to 1,000 times that of natural extinction .
this accelerated pace has not seen since the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago , according to un experts .
they blame human activities , including greenhouse-gas emissions and destruction of habitats for the loss .
one in four mammals , one bird in eight , one third of all amphibians and 70 percent of plants are under threat .
" in my view , climate change and the loss of biodiversity are the most alarming challenges on the global agenda , " gabriel said in a speech opening the conference , held once every two years .
gabriel said he would put his full support behind an agreement , saying it is time for countries to take action instead of producing " huge amounts of paper with little content . "
controversy hangs over convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainforests hold much of the world 's diverse plant and animal life the two-week un convention on biological diversity aims to agree on ways to slow rising extinction rates .
the un convention on biodiversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- was established at the earth summit in rio de janeiro in 1992 .
the bonn conference is the ninth meeting of its members .
yet it wo n't be easy for the 6,000 delegates from nearly 191 countries to agree on a plan for protecting biodiversity .
a un summit in 2002 set ambitious goals for slowing the rate by 2010 , but those are unlikely to be met .
" sixteen years after the rio summit , life on earth is at a crucial crossroads , " gabriel said .
" we 're still on the wrong track , and if we continue like this , we can see that we will not meet our target . "
food prices in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 70 percent of plant species are under threat the recent surge in food prices has increased the profile of biodiversity .
the food price increases are caused partly by increasing demand in asia as well as the use of crops to produce biofuel .
experts say that agricultural crops will suffer if wild plant strains disappear .
unless consumption habits change drastically , it will be impossible to feed nine billion people by 2050 , experts warn .
" the world is watching this conference and we can not fail , " the convention on biological diversity executive secretary ahmed djoghlaf told a news conference .
" business as usual is no more an option if humanity is going to survive .
losing biodiversity is not just losing trees and species , it is an economic and security loss , " djoghlaf said .
a $ 5 trillion resource bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries have accused the west of " biopiracy " djoghlaf cited a study which puts the annual value of the world 's protected areas at $ 5 trillion -lrb- 3.2 trillion euros -rrb- , in services such as food , timber or water purification , compared to $ 1.8 trillion in annual revenues for the automotive industry .
" this summit is a unprecedented opportunity for governments to stop talking and start acting , " said greenpeace international campaigner martin kaiser .
gabriel warned that if no action is taken , commercial fishing will have to end by 2050 , which would be devastating to millions of people who rely on fish protein .
benefits must be shared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants more done gabriel said a major priority of the conference , which ends on may 30 , was to agree on the framework for a 2010 deal on rules which govern the access to genetic resources and sharing their benefits .
gabriel also called for ensuring that developing countries share natural resources , and that they be compensated appropriately for them .
" industrialized countries must recognize the need to share natural resources with those with those who have safeguarded them , " gabriel said . " it is a question of principle , a question of justice . "
gabriel said that developing countries are right to use the word " biopiracy " when western countries use their resources without authorization or compensation . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bangladesh 's army-backed interim government has promised to clean up the country 's murky political scene , and 18 months after it took power , shows no sign of letting up .
the police seized mr nizami , the head of the largest islamic party , from his house at around midnight on sunday , despite a thunder storm and the presence of several hundred of his angry supporters .
' restoring democracy ' earlier on sunday police arrested two of mr nizami 's fellow former ministers , and a court charged another former prime minister sheikh hasina in a separate graft case .
mr nizami is one of the most important conservative religious figures in bangladesh .
he has said that the charges are politically motivated .
he is alleged to have benefited from the illegal awarding of business contracts , when jamaat-e-islami was a coalition partner of the bangladesh nationalist party of khaleda zia .
the police accuse her , one of her sons , and 22 others , including 11 former ministers of involvement in the illegal deals .
they all say they are innocent .
the military-backed government has promised to restore democracy by the end of the year , but its not clear who will lead the main political parties into the elections , as most prominent politicians are now behind bars .

if successful , supporters say the negotiations will decide the wording for an international agreement to ban cluster bombs that ' ' cause unacceptable harm to civilians " .
these munitions have been used in battle for more than 40 years in 30 countries , and were last deployed by the israelis in lebanon in the summer of 2006 .
cluster bombs are made up of a big container which opens in mid-air and drops hundreds of individual sub-munitions or " bomblets " over a wide area .
they usually explode once they hit their target . "
the types of cluster munitions we intend to retain are legitimate weapons with significant military value " defence secretary des browne it was the enormous damage caused to civilians during the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah that led a number of governments , led by norway , to back the oslo process , which aims to come up with a treaty by the end of 2008 .
the dublin meeting , set to begin on monday , is the penultimate step .
and while the uk government has shown a commitment to the process , it is strongly opposed to an outright ban .
instead , the government has stated it wants an exemption for the newest generation of cluster munitions .
' smart ' technology in a statement to parliament in march 2007 , defence secretary des browne said : " the types of cluster munitions we intend to retain are legitimate weapons with significant military value which , as a result of mitigating features , is not outweighed by humanitarian factors . "
in this case , the " mitigating factor " is so-called smart technology , which britain says minimises civilian casualties .
but mr browne 's assurances have not convinced some governments and campaign groups .
problems can arise when the sub-munitions or " bomblets " are used in populated areas but fail to go off .
if these cases , they can sit on the ground for years , effectively becoming landmines .
victims are often children , who mistake them for toys .
" these bomblets are the size of a soft drink can or tennis ball and spread hundreds of metal fragments that tear apart flesh and sever limbs , " said thomas nash , of the cluster munition coalitions -lrb- cmc -rrb- , an umbrella organisation for a number of anti-cm charities .
" as if that were n't bad enough , cluster bombs consistently leave deadly duds on the battlefield that act like landmines .
this problem not only affects lives but also shatters livelihoods because the unexploded cluster bombs make it dangerous or impossible to use land . "
britain got rid of its most unreliable sub-munitions - the rbl 755 and the multi-launch rocket system m26 munitions - last year .
however , it chose to keep " smart " sub-munitions like the m85 , last used in iraq in 2003 , because they contain self-destruct mechanisms .
mr browne said this technology significantly ' 'reduces the risk of harm to civilians " .
the government points to tests that suggest failure rates are as low as 2 % .
contrary evidence campaign groups strongly dispute this figure , saying those tests were carried out by the manufacturers themselves .
" claims by the uk that cluster munitions have a 2 % failure rate are not convincing at all , in fact the evidence shows they 're untenable , " said the cmc 's mr nash .
" research in lebanon , undertaken by experts including the norwegian defence research establishment , which itself used to conduct tests of self-destructing cluster munitions , showed the failure rate was more like 10 % .
" the un team responsible for the clearance in lebanon have supported these findings . "
figures from the charity landmine action estimate that in 2003 , the uk and us used around 13,000 cluster munitions containing an estimated 1.8 million to 2 million sub-munitions . "
ten years after it championed a treaty banning landmines , the uk has a chance to do the same with cluster bombs - but instead it is spinning a cluster bomb con " simon conway landmine action the cmc says cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties in iraq in 2003 than any other weapon .
the government insists that its testing is accurate , but says it takes the various studies seriously .
a number of leading charities , including oxfam , amnesty international and human rights watch , have also accused the uk government of attempting to re-name one of its two remaining cluster bombs in an effort to get around any future ban .
in a joint statement they said : " as recently as 26 november 2006 , the government listed the crv-7 rocket system , which can deliver 171 m73 bomblets , as a cluster munitions .
but on 16 july 2007 the government said the crv-7 was no longer a cluster bomb . "
' cynical move ' simon conway , director of landmine action , accused britain of " a deeply cynical move " .
" ten years after it championed a treaty banning landmines , the uk has a chance to do the same with cluster bombs - but instead it is spinning a cluster bomb con . "
the government said each crv-7 rocket contained nine m73 bomblets , not 171 .
the government stated it was not a cluster munition because of its " direct-fire capability , a small defined " footprint " and because each rocket contains only nine bomblets .
" taken together it is not likely to pose an unacceptable post-conflict humanitarian risk , " a spokesman said .
as the dublin talks kick off , the next two weeks will undoubtedly prove a diplomatic assault course , as governments seek to grapple with , stumble over or simply avoid the thorny issues of exemptions , definitions and timetables .
from the point of view of campaigners , anything less than a total ban would fail to protect the very civilians that the treaty is supposed to save .

a number of leading charities , including oxfam , amnesty international and human rights watch , have also accused the uk government of attempting to re-name one of its two remaining cluster bombs in an effort to get around any future ban .
in a joint statement they said : " as recently as 26 november 2006 , the government listed the crv-7 rocket system , which can deliver 171 m73 bomblets , as a cluster munitions .

the government said each crv-7 rocket contained nine m73 bomblets , not 171 .
the government stated it was not a cluster munition because of its " direct-fire capability , a small defined " footprint " and because each rocket contains only nine bomblets .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- who is to blame for food price rises ?

by nigel cassidy business reporter , bbc news global food prices may have shown some signs of stabilising , according to the united nations .
but it has not stopped large numbers of investors from piling into food commodities and options traded in the city of london and other financial centres around the world .
so much so that some farmers and foreign governments are putting the blame firmly on speculators for at least some of the 40 % year on year price gain for staples like wheat , soya and maize .
speculators blamed it is inevitable that financial investors are going to latch onto any cyclical commodity that 's seeing sharp price rises .
property may have bombed , demand for industrial raw materials may be peaking .
yet everyone has to pay more for food , so why not invest in farm products ? "
there is no question that we have seen a sharp increase in this kind of futures trading " nicholas brookes commodity trader , etf securities right now , everything seems to be conspiring to push up basic food prices .
from drought to poor crops , from high fuel prices to explosive demand , and changing diets in china and the far east .
and most of all , precious farmland being switched to crops for biofuels .
small wonder that in their quest for investments to beat inflation , even some traditional pension funds are trading in the likes of wheat , soya beans and livestock .
pushing up prices in the past year , nicholas brookes of the established city commodity traders etf securities says his company has handled £ 500m -lrb- $ 1bn -rrb- of traded investments in agricultural products .
" there is no question that we have seen a sharp increase in this kind of futures trading .
but the flows that are going into these products are miniscule compared to the underlying production of such agricultural goods globally .
my sense is that the level of these kind of investments will reduce over time . "
nicholas brookes is also firmly of the view that us subsidies on crops for ethanol production have pushed up world prices for farm products like maize and soya beans far more than any market speculation .
so should there be new regulations or curbs ?
certainly left-wing politicians in india and belgium think so .
they have both demanded a ban on the trading of options in agricultural products .
yet even academics devoted to helping the world feed itself do n't put the blame on traders .
' causes interconnected ' dr david barling of the centre for food policy at city university in london says he believes most of the market speculation in food products occurred after prices of grain and other commodities began rising sharply on world markets 18 months ago .
" it may have put further pressure on prices , but the causes are many , interconnected , and differ depending on the commodity concerned " .
graham mackay , chief executive of sabmiller , the world 's largest brewer , says his company is braced for further price rises in the main raw materials of barley , hops , and maize , and he thinks speculators may have played some part in putting pressure on prices .
but he says he is not remotely in favour of curbs on their activities .
he says the market is already distorted by subsidies which have discouraged an increase in supply .
other factors there are two further indicators that speculators are n't ultimately to blame for the soaring price of food .
one is that the price of rice has soared , even though most of the world crop is consumed in the countries where it is produced , and not generally offered as a traded option .

by nigel cassidy business reporter , bbc news the price of wheat and corn crops have escalated to record highs global food prices may have shown some signs of stabilising , according to the united nations .
but it has not stopped large numbers of investors from piling into food commodities and options traded in the city of london and other financial centres around the world .
so much so that some farmers and foreign governments are putting the blame firmly on speculators for at least some of the 40 % year on year price gain for staples like wheat , soya and maize .
speculators blamed it is inevitable that financial investors are going to latch onto any cyclical commodity that 's seeing sharp price rises .
property may have bombed , demand for industrial raw materials may be peaking .
yet everyone has to pay more for food , so why not invest in farm products ?
there is no question that we have seen a sharp increase in this kind of futures trading nicholas brookes commodity trader , etf securities right now , everything seems to be conspiring to push up basic food prices .
from drought to poor crops , from high fuel prices to explosive demand , and changing diets in china and the far east .
and most of all , precious farmland being switched to crops for biofuels .
small wonder that in their quest for investments to beat inflation , even some traditional pension funds are trading in the likes of wheat , soya beans and livestock .
pushing up prices in the past year , nicholas brookes of the established city commodity traders etf securities says his company has handled £ 500m -lrb- $ 1bn -rrb- of traded investments in agricultural products .
" there is no question that we have seen a sharp increase in this kind of futures trading .
but the flows that are going into these products are miniscule compared to the underlying production of such agricultural goods globally .
my sense is that the level of these kind of investments will reduce over time . "
the un say that food prices could have reached their peak nicholas brookes is also firmly of the view that us subsidies on crops for ethanol production have pushed up world prices for farm products like maize and soya beans far more than any market speculation .
so should there be new regulations or curbs ?
certainly left-wing politicians in india and belgium think so .
they have both demanded a ban on the trading of options in agricultural products .
yet even academics devoted to helping the world feed itself do n't put the blame on traders .
' causes interconnected ' dr david barling of the centre for food policy at city university in london says he believes most of the market speculation in food products occurred after prices of grain and other commodities began rising sharply on world markets 18 months ago .
" it may have put further pressure on prices , but the causes are many , interconnected , and differ depending on the commodity concerned " .
prices have levelled off , but show no signs of dropping graham mackay , chief executive of sabmiller , the world 's largest brewer , says his company is braced for further price rises in the main raw materials of barley , hops , and maize , and he thinks speculators may have played some part in putting pressure on prices .
but he says he is not remotely in favour of curbs on their activities .
he says the market is already distorted by subsidies which have discouraged an increase in supply .
other factors there are two further indicators that speculators are n't ultimately to blame for the soaring price of food .
one is that the price of rice has soared , even though most of the world crop is consumed in the countries where it is produced , and not generally offered as a traded option .
and world food stockpiles are low , suggesting agricultural products are not being bought wholesale to sell on at an even higher price .
even so , " food speculators " are an easy target for politicians struggling to show they are doing something to mitigate price rises they are near powerless to resist .

scientists at patiala university , punjab state , did the study , tracking a group of farmers for several months .
but a spokesman for the crop industry trade association said a causal link between pesticide use and cancer could not be established .
there have been concerns about potential links for several years .
this new study discovered that the dna of farmers in punjab has been altered , making them susceptible to cancer .
' significant change ' professor satbir kaur said the study ruled out other factors such as age , alcohol intake and smoking , concluding that the probable cause of this fundamental change in the building block of life was use of pesticide sprays .
" we found significant change in the dna , so the cancer risk is greatly increased when the extent of dna damage is very high , " he said .
salil singhal of the industry trade association , the crop care federation of india , said that this causal link could not be possible .
" there is no pesticide in use today which can cause cancer , " he said .
mr singhal said farmers use sprays only a few times each season .
but this correspondent found farmers who needed to use them far more than that in order to keep ahead of the pests .
one farmer , who said that he was spraying night and day , does have cancer .
as the world struggles to find its way back to securing affordable food supplies , new crop varieties have not kept up the promise of the early days of the green revolution in asia .
meanwhile , yields have gone down .
and these disturbing indications of a potential threat to human health raise questions over whether intensive farming like this is sustainable .

scientists at patiala university , punjab state , did the study , tracking a group of farmers for several months .

salil singhal of the industry trade association , the crop care federation of india , said that this causal link could not be possible .
" there is no pesticide in use today which can cause cancer , " he said .

microsoft 's previous offer to buy yahoo for $ 33 a share - a figure which valued the company at $ 47.5bn -lrb- £ 24.36bn -rrb- - was turned down .
last week yahoo rebuffed billionaire investor carl icahn 's plan to oust the current board over the failed merger .
now microsoft says it is discussing with yahoo an alternative transaction , but did not provide any detail .
' stockholder value ' in a statement , microsoft said it " is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of yahoo at this time , but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative " .
it issued the statement , it said , " in light of developments " since the company withdrew its bid two weeks ago .
microsoft stressed that a deal may or may not follow from sunday 's statement .
after microsoft 's statement , yahoo confirmed it was looking at a number of " value maximising " alternatives with microsoft , and would assess offers made by the firm .
the internet firm said its board would evaluate each of the alternatives " including any microsoft proposal ... with a focus on maximising stockholder value " .
analysts say any agreement could save yahoo from having to fight a battle with mr icahn , who is amassing a stake in the company in an attempt to force out the current board .
mr icahn 's manoeuvre on thursday followed much criticism over yahoo 's decision , led by co-founder and chief executive jerry yang , to turn down microsoft 's offer earlier this month to buy the company .
yahoo had wanted microsoft to increase its bid of $ 33 a share to $ 37 .
yahoo has also been looking into an alliance with internet giant google , and the firms recently tested an advertising partnership for two weeks .
if they were joined together this would make yahoo a less likely target for acquisition , analysts say .

microsoft 's previous offer to buy yahoo for $ 33 a share - a figure which valued the company at $ 47.5bn -lrb- £ 24.36bn -rrb- - was turned down .
last week yahoo rebuffed billionaire investor carl icahn 's plan to oust the current board over the failed merger .
now microsoft says it is discussing with yahoo an alternative transaction , but did not provide any detail .
' stockholder value ' in a statement , microsoft said it " is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of yahoo at this time , but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative " .
it issued the statement , it said , " in light of developments " since the company withdrew its bid two weeks ago .
microsoft stressed that a deal may or may not follow from sunday 's statement .
after microsoft 's statement , yahoo confirmed it was looking at a number of " value maximising " alternatives with microsoft , and would assess offers made by the firm .
the internet firm said its board would evaluate each of the alternatives " including any microsoft proposal ... with a focus on maximising stockholder value " .
analysts say any agreement could save yahoo from having to fight a battle with mr icahn , who is amassing a stake in the company in an attempt to force out the current board .
mr icahn 's manoeuvre on thursday followed much criticism over yahoo 's decision , led by co-founder and chief executive jerry yang , to turn down microsoft 's offer earlier this month to buy the company .
yahoo had wanted microsoft to increase its bid of $ 33 a share to $ 37 .
yahoo has also been looking into an alliance with internet giant google , and the firms recently tested an advertising partnership for two weeks .
if they were joined together this would make yahoo a less likely target for acquisition , analysts say .

advertisement liz shipley believes the research may lead to future treatment legislation permitting controversial research which uses animal eggs to help make human cells for research is to be debated in the house of commons .
the process takes virtually all the animal 's genetic material out of the egg and replaces it with human dna .
critics say it is wrong to combine animal and human genetic material in admixed embryos , which then produce stem cells , in this way .
but liz shipley , who has motor neurone disease -lrb- mnd -rrb- , says such research gives her hope there will one day be a cure .
mnd is a muscle wasting disease .
as the motor neurone cells in the brain and spine die and stop sending messages to muscles , the muscles gradually die .
but the person 's brain is unaffected .
mnd takes away a little piece of you , bit by bit liz shipley most people with mnd have the sporadic form of the disease , which appears for no apparent reason .
but , in about 5- 10 % of cases , there is a family history .
in liz 's case , her grandfather , mother , two uncles , her sister and a cousin have all died from the disease .
she has watched them deteriorate , and knows what lies ahead for her .
" it ends up leaving you totally paralysed and unable to do anything , but the brain 's unaffected . "
she added : " i have cared for someone with mnd .
i 've been on both sides of the fence .
i know what the outcome is going to be , and i ca n't change that . "
death sentence the family risk was only established after liz had had her two children , and it is possible that they too could develop mnd .
liz shipley with her family before she became ill liz , 46 , from newcastle , was diagnosed 10 years ago .
her legs and arms are now very weak , and she needs a wheelchair to get around .
she said : " mnd takes away a little piece of you , bit by bit . "
" i ca n't go out without someone being with me .
even something like making a cup of tea is very difficult on my own . "
she added : " this technique should be able to be used in the hope it can find a treatment for mnd .
i hope mps let it go ahead .
" they 're not creating any human beings .
they just need the cells in order to hopefully find a treatment and a cure . "
" it would be brilliant if , one day , neurologists could say ' well you 've got mnd , but we can do something about it ' .at the moment , there is n't anything .
" it would n't be in my lifetime , but if my children are unfortunate to develop mnd , hopefully in their lifetime there will be a cure , and they wo n't have to face the consequences of mnd .

advertisement liz shipley believes the research may lead to future treatment legislation permitting controversial research which uses animal eggs to help make human cells for research is to be debated in the house of commons .
the process takes virtually all the animal 's genetic material out of the egg and replaces it with human dna .
critics say it is wrong to combine animal and human genetic material in admixed embryos , which then produce stem cells , in this way .
but liz shipley , who has motor neurone disease -lrb- mnd -rrb- , says such research gives her hope there will one day be a cure .
mnd is a muscle wasting disease .
as the motor neurone cells in the brain and spine die and stop sending messages to muscles , the muscles gradually die .
but the person 's brain is unaffected .
mnd takes away a little piece of you , bit by bit liz shipley most people with mnd have the sporadic form of the disease , which appears for no apparent reason .
but , in about 5- 10 % of cases , there is a family history .
in liz 's case , her grandfather , mother , two uncles , her sister and a cousin have all died from the disease .
she has watched them deteriorate , and knows what lies ahead for her .
" it ends up leaving you totally paralysed and unable to do anything , but the brain 's unaffected . "
she added : " i have cared for someone with mnd .
i 've been on both sides of the fence .
i know what the outcome is going to be , and i ca n't change that . "
death sentence the family risk was only established after liz had had her two children , and it is possible that they too could develop mnd .
liz shipley with her family before she became ill liz , 46 , from newcastle , was diagnosed 10 years ago .

in its updated forecast for the housing market in 2008 , rics also predicted that prices would fall by 5 % .
such a sales drop would represent the biggest shrinkage in the housing market since modern records began and could cut consumer spending by 8 % , rics said .
the slowdown has also led to removals firms seeing a slump in business .
rics chief economist simon rubinsohn said the outlook was worrying .
" money looks set to remain tight and many will continue to find that access to the market is restricted by cautious lenders , " he said .
" this could have important ramifications for the wider economy , " he added .
removals mr rubinsohn said that a broad range of sectors related to the property market could also be hit , " whether that is the high street purveyors of home furnishings and white goods or financial intermediaries involved in providing mortgage advice " .

advertisement how the downturn in the housing market is affecting removal firms this is already happening to removal companies .
martin rose , a consultant to the national guild of removers and storers , told the bbc its members had seen business slump recently .
moves were down by 55 % in the first three months of this year , and down by 68 % in the past six weeks .
" normally we would expect that after easter that trade usually picks up , but this year it went completely the other way and i can almost use the word ' collapse ' , " he said .
if the predictions of rics turn out to be accurate than there will be around 700,000 fewer residential and commercial property sales this year than in 2007 .
credit crunch the slump in the property market this year has been caused by a combination of reasons .
one of the major factor has been a decade-long boom in prices which has made buying a home unaffordable for many new buyers .
but the trigger for the slump has been the credit crunch in the banking system , which has forced mortgage lenders to ration their loans .
according to figures from the department of communities and local government -lrb- dclg -rrb- the biggest annual fall in property sales so far was in 1989 when , in england and wales , they fell by 26 % .
but sales are already down by 32 % on a year ago , says rics .
repossessions many commentators have been forced to revise downwards their predictions for prices , with expectations of an overall fall during the course of 2008 now commonplace .
the head of the building societies association recently warned that the property market might not recover for another two years , despite attempts by the bank of england to free up inter-bank lending by injecting new funds into the banking system .
despite this , rics says homeowners are under less threat of negative equity and repossession than was the case in the recession of the early 1990s .
this , it says , is a result of recent borrowers having to put down larger deposits and paying off their loans with conventional repayment mortgages .
rics said : " 100 % mortgages have not been as common , -lsb- we -rsb- estimate that the average loan-to-value ratio between 2005 and 2007 was in the region of 85 % compared with 90 % in the period between 1985 and 1989 . "
" in the three years to 2007 , 71 % of first-time buyers ' mortgages were made on a capital and interest repayment basis compared to only 17 % in the three years to 1989 , " it added .
even so rics is still expecting repossessions to rise this year to about 43,000 .

in its updated forecast for the housing market in 2008 , rics also predicted that prices would fall by 5 % .
such a sales drop would represent the biggest shrinkage in the housing market since modern records began and could cut consumer spending by 8 % , rics said .
the slowdown has also led to removals firms seeing a slump in business .
rics chief economist simon rubinsohn said the outlook was worrying .
" money looks set to remain tight and many will continue to find that access to the market is restricted by cautious lenders , " he said .
" this could have important ramifications for the wider economy , " he added .
removals mr rubinsohn said that a broad range of sectors related to the property market could also be hit , " whether that is the high street purveyors of home furnishings and white goods or financial intermediaries involved in providing mortgage advice " .

advertisement how the downturn in the housing market is affecting removal firms this is already happening to removal companies .
martin rose , a consultant to the national guild of removers and storers , told the bbc its members had seen business slump recently .
moves were down by 55 % in the first three months of this year , and down by 68 % in the past six weeks .
" normally we would expect that after easter that trade usually picks up , but this year it went completely the other way and i can almost use the word ' collapse ' , " he said .
if the predictions of rics turn out to be accurate than there will be around 700,000 fewer residential and commercial property sales this year than in 2007 .
credit crunch the slump in the property market this year has been caused by a combination of reasons .
one of the major factor has been a decade-long boom in prices which has made buying a home unaffordable for many new buyers .
but the trigger for the slump has been the credit crunch in the banking system , which has forced mortgage lenders to ration their loans .
according to figures from the department of communities and local government -lrb- dclg -rrb- the biggest annual fall in property sales so far was in 1989 when , in england and wales , they fell by 26 % .
but sales are already down by 32 % on a year ago , says rics .
repossessions many commentators have been forced to revise downwards their predictions for prices , with expectations of an overall fall during the course of 2008 now commonplace .
the head of the building societies association recently warned that the property market might not recover for another two years , despite attempts by the bank of england to free up inter-bank lending by injecting new funds into the banking system .
despite this , rics says homeowners are under less threat of negative equity and repossession than was the case in the recession of the early 1990s .
this , it says , is a result of recent borrowers having to put down larger deposits and paying off their loans with conventional repayment mortgages .
rics said : " 100 % mortgages have not been as common , -lsb- we -rsb- estimate that the average loan-to-value ratio between 2005 and 2007 was in the region of 85 % compared with 90 % in the period between 1985 and 1989 . "
" in the three years to 2007 , 71 % of first-time buyers ' mortgages were made on a capital and interest repayment basis compared to only 17 % in the three years to 1989 , " it added .
even so rics is still expecting repossessions to rise this year to about 43,000 .

the council refused the planning permission for the scheme last year on the grounds of its adverse environmental impact .
it was a move which went against planning officers ' recommendations .
a public inquiry was subsequently held at selkirk rugby club earlier this year .
after studying all the submissions a reporter has ruled the development can go ahead .
developers have said the project would generate electricity for about 12,000 homes and link to the national grid at hawick .

advertisement miodio are bringing a flavour of san marino to eurovision by michael osborn entertainment reporter , bbc news the tiny state of san marino is poised to take a great leap when it takes part in the eurovision song contest for the very first time .
the appenine country surrounded entirely by italy - population 31,000 , popular exports stamps and coins - is pinning its hopes on five-piece band miodio to make a musical impression with their song complice .
so why has the small republic , said to be the world 's oldest , decided to join the eurovision family ?
san marino facts it is 61 sq km -lrb- 23.6 sq miles -rrb- in area founded in 301 by a stonemason fleeing religious persecution the country 's heads of state are two captains-regent neutral during world war ii was the world 's smallest republic until 1968 when nauru gained independence country profile : san marino alessandro capicchioni , head of the sanmarinese eurovision delegation , says there is one simple answer - the latest boss of state broadcaster smrtv was interested in launching a bid .
but there are more palpable reasons for a little-known country to have their moment on the big stage .
" san marino 's name will be in the mouths of many more people , " explains mr capicchioni .
" we 're a little state , we need tourism , we need our name to be spread .
a lot of the world knows neither where san marino is or if it even exists .
" eurovision is oxygen for us .
we will have three minutes on stage like every other country .
san marino 's name will be heard on the tv and written on a graphic in a live broadcast , " he adds .
the search to find san marino 's first eurovision entry prompted a flurry of submissions from seasoned songwriters around europe - but the judging panel decided to remain resolutely local .
' more potential ' " we chose something that would bring italian and sanmarinese culture to europe - a melodic song from our tradition , " explains mr capicchioni .
" we did n't want a song made by eurovision professionals sung in english .
we all agreed - miodio was the perfect choice .
san marino 's name will be in the mouths of many more people alessandro capicchioni , head of san marino 's eurovision delegation " our strength is performing in italian and has more potential than other small countries like malta and andorra , " he adds .
even the small pyrenean nation , which used to insist on performing in catalan , has plumped for a euro-friendly disco tune in english this year .
the sanmarinese are upbeat about their chances of success , while the bookmakers give them only a 100/1 chance of qualifying from their semi-final berth , and eurovision fans ' reaction has been very mixed .
mr capicchioni says he hoped san marino will reach the final - " but we are not looking for a victory " .
he tips switzerland - also performing in italian - to win .
but if the diminuitive republic went all the way , finding a venue to host the 2009 competition could prove a problem .
" we do n't know what would happen if we won - we prefer not to think of it .
maybe we 'd stage it in rimini , maybe in the sea ! " jokes the country 's eurovision boss .
san marino is physically surrounded by italy , whose cool relationship with the song contest has bubbled to the surface again .
san marino are likely to lend their support to switzerland 's italian language song they have not participated for a decade , and san marino 's emergence has led to speculation that the italians could be enticed back into the fold - a notion dismissed by mr capicchioni .
" italy are not interested .
they 're not considering taking part just because san marino is and we 're not preparing them for next time , " he says .
in fact , whether their eurovision song gives san marino three minutes of publicity and few points , they hope to return next year , a little wiser for their moment in the limelight .
san marino participates in the first eurovision semi-final on tuesday 20 may , which is on bbc three from 2000 bst .

advertisement miodio are bringing a flavour of san marino to eurovision by michael osborn entertainment reporter , bbc news the tiny state of san marino is poised to take a great leap when it takes part in the eurovision song contest for the very first time .
the appenine country surrounded entirely by italy - population 31,000 , popular exports stamps and coins - is pinning its hopes on five-piece band miodio to make a musical impression with their song complice .
so why has the small republic , said to be the world 's oldest , decided to join the eurovision family ?
san marino facts it is 61 sq km -lrb- 23.6 sq miles -rrb- in area founded in 301 by a stonemason fleeing religious persecution the country 's heads of state are two captains-regent neutral during world war ii was the world 's smallest republic until 1968 when nauru gained independence country profile : san marino alessandro capicchioni , head of the sanmarinese eurovision delegation , says there is one simple answer - the latest boss of state broadcaster smrtv was interested in launching a bid .
but there are more palpable reasons for a little-known country to have their moment on the big stage .
" san marino 's name will be in the mouths of many more people , " explains mr capicchioni .
" we 're a little state , we need tourism , we need our name to be spread .
a lot of the world knows neither where san marino is or if it even exists .
" eurovision is oxygen for us .
we will have three minutes on stage like every other country .
san marino 's name will be heard on the tv and written on a graphic in a live broadcast , " he adds .
the search to find san marino 's first eurovision entry prompted a flurry of submissions from seasoned songwriters around europe - but the judging panel decided to remain resolutely local .
' more potential ' " we chose something that would bring italian and sanmarinese culture to europe - a melodic song from our tradition , " explains mr capicchioni .
" we did n't want a song made by eurovision professionals sung in english .
we all agreed - miodio was the perfect choice .
san marino 's name will be in the mouths of many more people alessandro capicchioni , head of san marino 's eurovision delegation " our strength is performing in italian and has more potential than other small countries like malta and andorra , " he adds .
even the small pyrenean nation , which used to insist on performing in catalan , has plumped for a euro-friendly disco tune in english this year .
the sanmarinese are upbeat about their chances of success , while the bookmakers give them only a 100/1 chance of qualifying from their semi-final berth , and eurovision fans ' reaction has been very mixed .
mr capicchioni says he hoped san marino will reach the final - " but we are not looking for a victory " .
he tips switzerland - also performing in italian - to win .
but if the diminuitive republic went all the way , finding a venue to host the 2009 competition could prove a problem .
" we do n't know what would happen if we won - we prefer not to think of it .
maybe we 'd stage it in rimini , maybe in the sea ! " jokes the country 's eurovision boss .
san marino is physically surrounded by italy , whose cool relationship with the song contest has bubbled to the surface again .
san marino are likely to lend their support to switzerland 's italian language song they have not participated for a decade , and san marino 's emergence has led to speculation that the italians could be enticed back into the fold - a notion dismissed by mr capicchioni .
" italy are not interested .
they 're not considering taking part just because san marino is and we 're not preparing them for next time , " he says .
in fact , whether their eurovision song gives san marino three minutes of publicity and few points , they hope to return next year , a little wiser for their moment in the limelight .
san marino participates in the first eurovision semi-final on tuesday 20 may , which is on bbc three from 2000 bst .
