captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack is not yet back to full fitness after foot surgery ballack , meanwhile , has resumed training after foot surgery in mid-october , but was deemed to have had too long a break to make the cut for next wednesday 's match .
philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 13.11.2008 rwandan president condemns french indictment against aide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have been protesting outside the german embassy in kigali tensions mount between rwanda and germany , following the detainment of a rwandan presidential aide in frankfurt on a french warrant .
but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .

" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "
" if that 's the case , that would constitute a serious violation of international law , " she said .

charges of violence on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been powerless to stop rebel forces to add to the civilians ' woes , some have also been targeted by government forces , the un said .
monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .

the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .
" we are concerned about the sheer size of this situation . "
the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .
many of the refugees caught up in the fierce fighting of the last two weeks were forced to flee without even basic supplies such as blankets and are now caught outside in the rainy season .
the 17,000-strong monuc force in dr congo has warned it is overstretched and undermanned .
india and pakistan have contributed the two largest military contingents to the mission .
with only 5,400 peacekeepers in nord-kivu province , monuc head alan doss called in october for an additional 3,000 troops , a plea that has so far gone unanswered . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .

criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .
e.h. was arrested when he returned to germany , where he had been preparing for university studies in kiel . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .

estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .

13 , at ways to strengthen crisis mechanisms and boost oil and gas stocks to respond to any disruption in supply . the 27 eu countries import natural gas from algeria and norway but rely on russia for around 30 percent of their needs , with the baltic states even more dependent on their giant neighbor . with confidence in russian policies at a low after the georgia war in august and the memory of a gas price dispute between russia and ukraine that briefly turned off gas to some european countries in 2006 , the european union is reexamining the stability of its energy supplies . " we have to do more , be more ambitious , and be even bolder to avoid the risk of energy disruption in the future , " eu energy commission andris piebalgs said .
norway to supply more to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more norwegian gas going to be headed to eu countries norway , which is not a member of the eu , said it would increase the amount of gas it exports to the bloc , prime minister jens stoltenberg said on wednesday . norwegian gas exports to the eu could increase from 100 billion cubic meters -lrb- bcm -rrb- to between 125 billion and 140 billion cubic meters by 2020 , he told reporters after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " we are going to increase our exports of natural gas to europe , and you can count on norway when it comes to energy supplies to europe , " stoltenberg told reporters . while he lent his support to the planned scanled project , which could bring norway 's gas to east to poland , stoltenberg said there were no new plans for a major pipeline to the eu . to ensure the security of energy supplies to the baltic states , an interconnection plan , covering gas , electricity and storage in 2009 , which would identify the infrastructure needed to link these nations to the rest of the eu .
such a plan would make turning off gas to baltic states without affecting western eu members impossible . the commission 's report also emphasized the development of a " southern gas corridor " to import energy from the caspian sea and middle east regions without crossing russian territory . putin : russia has options beyond eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members disagree on the importance of the nord stream pipeline the possibility of major changes to european energy policy have irritated russia , with prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday threatening to cancel plans for the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea to germany if eu members kept delaying the disputed project . " europe has to decide if it needs the pipeline or not , " putin said , adding that russia would consider investing in gas liquefaction facilities that would allow it to sell its gas on the world market . brussels has identified the 7.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- project , a joint venture involving russia 's gazprom , and germany 's e.on and basf , as an important step in securing gas supplies for europe .
but it has been criticized in poland , lithuania and estonia , which are upset at being bypassed , as well as in sweden on environmental grounds . " we need this pipeline , but if the risks are too high then there 's nothing that can be done , " piebalgs said , referring to the potential damage the pipeline could cause the environment .
" we can not lower our environmental standards . " the german government said thursday it was sticking to plans to build the pipeline and called on the disagreeing parties need to " construction discussions " to get the 1,220-km -lrb- 758-mile -rrb- pipeline built . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 13.11.2008 rwandan president condemns french indictment against aide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have been protesting outside the german embassy in kigali tensions mount between rwanda and germany , following the detainment of a rwandan presidential aide in frankfurt on a french warrant .
but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "
" if that 's the case , that would constitute a serious violation of international law , " she said .
nkunda 's forces captured kiwanja on nov .

charges of violence on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been powerless to stop rebel forces to add to the civilians ' woes , some have also been targeted by government forces , the un said .
monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .
humanitarian disaster with thousands of congolese being pushed from camp to camp by the sporadic outbreaks of violence , many were not gaining access to emergency aid , humanitarian group doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- warned .
the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .

the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .
many of the refugees caught up in the fierce fighting of the last two weeks were forced to flee without even basic supplies such as blankets and are now caught outside in the rainy season .
the 17,000-strong monuc force in dr congo has warned it is overstretched and undermanned .
india and pakistan have contributed the two largest military contingents to the mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.11.2008 german economy slumps into recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood was gloomy in germany as fears of a recession were confirmed europe 's biggest economy and the world 's top exporter fell into a recession for the first time in five years , new data shows .
the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .
the government says the package , which includes soft loans for medium-sized industry and for home insulation as well as a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars , will stimulate 50 billion euros in spending in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's traditionally strong exports are expected to take a major hit data to be published on friday is also predicted to show france - the 15-member eurozone 's second biggest economy - also slipped into recession during the third quarter .

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .
" there can be no denying that the russia-georgia conflict last august has changed the european security environment , " de hoop scheffer said .
" the unilateral recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia by russia , violating basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity , will not lead to the viable euro-atlantic security structure we seek to achieve in constructive engagement with russia . "
he voiced hopes that russia would change course on stationing missiles in its baltic enclave of kaliningrad .
estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .
" and we need to convey that nato is very much on track , working with countries in the east on this process of developing a europe whole and free . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .
afghanistan mission controversial in germany the afghan aspect of the oef has been controversial in germany because of the growing number of civilians killed in military operations against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated . " both operation enduring freedom and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- missions in afghanistan have been criticized by german lawmakers after recent cases of civilian deaths . in late october , german soldiers fired on a vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint wounding five afghans , and two german soldiers and five children were killed by a suicide bomber .
a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "
more research will be needed to determine what exact significance , if any , the breakthrough at the charite has for the overall fight against aids .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

13 , that he thought the incoming obama administration may be more willing to negotiate over the missile system than the incumbent bush administration had been .
" we are prepared to drop our decision to deploy missiles at kaliningrad if the new american administration decides to abandon its anti-missile system , " he said , noting that , based on early reactions , obama was " thinking about it . "
" we hope to create frank and honest relations with the new administration and resolve problems that we were not able to resolve with the current administration , " he said .
the russian president said moscow was willing to consider " a global defense system with the united states , the eu nations and the russian federation . "
medvedev also said he had spoken with obama by telephone and would like to meet him in person soon .
obama not backing down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has n't been swayed by inflamed russian rhetoric over the missile system but obama stated as recently as saturday , nov .

" barack obama has underlined the importance of the strategic partnership between poland and the united states , " kaczynski said in a statement after the talk .
" he expressed his hope of continuing the political and military cooperation between our two countries .
" he also said the anti-missile shield project would go ahead . "
the us plans to build 10 interceptor missiles on polish territory and a radar facility in the czech republic by 2011 to 2013 .
the new components would complete a system already in place in the us , greenland and britain .
washington says the shield - endorsed by nato in february - is aimed at defending against potential attacks by so-called " rogue states " such as iran and north korea and would not be aimed at russia .
in response to the system , medvedev has threatened to deploy short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad .

medvedev said the participants must build the basis of " a new bretton woods . "
in reconstructing the world 's economic system , as the 1944 bretton woods meeting did , heads of the world 's leading industrial nations must establish " new international credit institutions , a new accounting system , a new risk insurance system , " the russian president said .
moscow had already suggested the development of a risk alert system that all countries would set up independently , he said .
medvedev said he had already shared his ideas with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we share the same vision about the origin of the crisis , " he said .
" we must find the solutions to stabilize and reform the system for the long term . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "

philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .

it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .

his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated .

a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .

the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .
the government says the package , which includes soft loans for medium-sized industry and for home insulation as well as a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars , will stimulate 50 billion euros in spending in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's traditionally strong exports are expected to take a major hit data to be published on friday is also predicted to show france - the 15-member eurozone 's second biggest economy - also slipped into recession during the third quarter .

13 , that he thought the incoming obama administration may be more willing to negotiate over the missile system than the incumbent bush administration had been .
" we are prepared to drop our decision to deploy missiles at kaliningrad if the new american administration decides to abandon its anti-missile system , " he said , noting that , based on early reactions , obama was " thinking about it . "
" we hope to create frank and honest relations with the new administration and resolve problems that we were not able to resolve with the current administration , " he said .
the russian president said moscow was willing to consider " a global defense system with the united states , the eu nations and the russian federation . "
medvedev also said he had spoken with obama by telephone and would like to meet him in person soon .

" barack obama has underlined the importance of the strategic partnership between poland and the united states , " kaczynski said in a statement after the talk .
" he expressed his hope of continuing the political and military cooperation between our two countries .
" he also said the anti-missile shield project would go ahead . "
the us plans to build 10 interceptor missiles on polish territory and a radar facility in the czech republic by 2011 to 2013 .
the new components would complete a system already in place in the us , greenland and britain .
washington says the shield - endorsed by nato in february - is aimed at defending against potential attacks by so-called " rogue states " such as iran and north korea and would not be aimed at russia .
in response to the system , medvedev has threatened to deploy short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad .

medvedev said the participants must build the basis of " a new bretton woods . "
in reconstructing the world 's economic system , as the 1944 bretton woods meeting did , heads of the world 's leading industrial nations must establish " new international credit institutions , a new accounting system , a new risk insurance system , " the russian president said .
moscow had already suggested the development of a risk alert system that all countries would set up independently , he said .
medvedev said he had already shared his ideas with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we share the same vision about the origin of the crisis , " he said .
" we must find the solutions to stabilize and reform the system for the long term . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .

the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .
" there can be no denying that the russia-georgia conflict last august has changed the european security environment , " de hoop scheffer said .
" the unilateral recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia by russia , violating basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity , will not lead to the viable euro-atlantic security structure we seek to achieve in constructive engagement with russia . "
he voiced hopes that russia would change course on stationing missiles in its baltic enclave of kaliningrad .
estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .
" and we need to convey that nato is very much on track , working with countries in the east on this process of developing a europe whole and free . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 13.11.2008 rwandan president condemns french indictment against aide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have been protesting outside the german embassy in kigali tensions mount between rwanda and germany , following the detainment of a rwandan presidential aide in frankfurt on a french warrant .
but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "
more research will be needed to determine what exact significance , if any , the breakthrough at the charite has for the overall fight against aids .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .
e.h. was arrested when he returned to germany , where he had been preparing for university studies in kiel . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.11.2008 german economy slumps into recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood was gloomy in germany as fears of a recession were confirmed europe 's biggest economy and the world 's top exporter fell into a recession for the first time in five years , new data shows .
the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .
the government says the package , which includes soft loans for medium-sized industry and for home insulation as well as a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars , will stimulate 50 billion euros in spending in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's traditionally strong exports are expected to take a major hit data to be published on friday is also predicted to show france - the 15-member eurozone 's second biggest economy - also slipped into recession during the third quarter .
with the euro area 's two largest economies in recession , the european central bank is likely to face mounting pressure to follow up this month 's 50-basis-points cut with another hefty reduction in borrowing costs in december .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .

" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.11.2008 german economy slumps into recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mood was gloomy in germany as fears of a recession were confirmed europe 's biggest economy and the world 's top exporter fell into a recession for the first time in five years , new data shows .
the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "

the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .
the government says the package , which includes soft loans for medium-sized industry and for home insulation as well as a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars , will stimulate 50 billion euros in spending in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's traditionally strong exports are expected to take a major hit data to be published on friday is also predicted to show france - the 15-member eurozone 's second biggest economy - also slipped into recession during the third quarter .
with the euro area 's two largest economies in recession , the european central bank is likely to face mounting pressure to follow up this month 's 50-basis-points cut with another hefty reduction in borrowing costs in december .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .

bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "
" if that 's the case , that would constitute a serious violation of international law , " she said .
nkunda 's forces captured kiwanja on nov .

human rights watch said this week that at least 50 civilians were killed in the smoke out .
charges of violence on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been powerless to stop rebel forces to add to the civilians ' woes , some have also been targeted by government forces , the un said .
monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .
humanitarian disaster with thousands of congolese being pushed from camp to camp by the sporadic outbreaks of violence , many were not gaining access to emergency aid , humanitarian group doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- warned .
the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .
" we are concerned about the sheer size of this situation . "
the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .
many of the refugees caught up in the fierce fighting of the last two weeks were forced to flee without even basic supplies such as blankets and are now caught outside in the rainy season .
the 17,000-strong monuc force in dr congo has warned it is overstretched and undermanned .
india and pakistan have contributed the two largest military contingents to the mission .
with only 5,400 peacekeepers in nord-kivu province , monuc head alan doss called in october for an additional 3,000 troops , a plea that has so far gone unanswered . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "

captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack is not yet back to full fitness after foot surgery ballack , meanwhile , has resumed training after foot surgery in mid-october , but was deemed to have had too long a break to make the cut for next wednesday 's match .
philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .
afghanistan mission controversial in germany the afghan aspect of the oef has been controversial in germany because of the growing number of civilians killed in military operations against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated . " both operation enduring freedom and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- missions in afghanistan have been criticized by german lawmakers after recent cases of civilian deaths . in late october , german soldiers fired on a vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint wounding five afghans , and two german soldiers and five children were killed by a suicide bomber .
a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .

" we have to do more , be more ambitious , and be even bolder to avoid the risk of energy disruption in the future , " eu energy commission andris piebalgs said .

" we are going to increase our exports of natural gas to europe , and you can count on norway when it comes to energy supplies to europe , " stoltenberg told reporters . while he lent his support to the planned scanled project , which could bring norway 's gas to east to poland , stoltenberg said there were no new plans for a major pipeline to the eu . to ensure the security of energy supplies to the baltic states , an interconnection plan , covering gas , electricity and storage in 2009 , which would identify the infrastructure needed to link these nations to the rest of the eu .
such a plan would make turning off gas to baltic states without affecting western eu members impossible . the commission 's report also emphasized the development of a " southern gas corridor " to import energy from the caspian sea and middle east regions without crossing russian territory . putin : russia has options beyond eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members disagree on the importance of the nord stream pipeline the possibility of major changes to european energy policy have irritated russia , with prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday threatening to cancel plans for the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea to germany if eu members kept delaying the disputed project . " europe has to decide if it needs the pipeline or not , " putin said , adding that russia would consider investing in gas liquefaction facilities that would allow it to sell its gas on the world market . brussels has identified the 7.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- project , a joint venture involving russia 's gazprom , and germany 's e.on and basf , as an important step in securing gas supplies for europe .
but it has been criticized in poland , lithuania and estonia , which are upset at being bypassed , as well as in sweden on environmental grounds . " we need this pipeline , but if the risks are too high then there 's nothing that can be done , " piebalgs said , referring to the potential damage the pipeline could cause the environment .
" we can not lower our environmental standards . " the german government said thursday it was sticking to plans to build the pipeline and called on the disagreeing parties need to " construction discussions " to get the 1,220-km -lrb- 758-mile -rrb- pipeline built . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .

estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .

these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .
" there can be no denying that the russia-georgia conflict last august has changed the european security environment , " de hoop scheffer said .
" the unilateral recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia by russia , violating basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity , will not lead to the viable euro-atlantic security structure we seek to achieve in constructive engagement with russia . "
he voiced hopes that russia would change course on stationing missiles in its baltic enclave of kaliningrad .
estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .
" and we need to convey that nato is very much on track , working with countries in the east on this process of developing a europe whole and free . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .

defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .

13 , that he thought the incoming obama administration may be more willing to negotiate over the missile system than the incumbent bush administration had been .
" we are prepared to drop our decision to deploy missiles at kaliningrad if the new american administration decides to abandon its anti-missile system , " he said , noting that , based on early reactions , obama was " thinking about it . "
" we hope to create frank and honest relations with the new administration and resolve problems that we were not able to resolve with the current administration , " he said .
the russian president said moscow was willing to consider " a global defense system with the united states , the eu nations and the russian federation . "
medvedev also said he had spoken with obama by telephone and would like to meet him in person soon .
obama not backing down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has n't been swayed by inflamed russian rhetoric over the missile system but obama stated as recently as saturday , nov .

" barack obama has underlined the importance of the strategic partnership between poland and the united states , " kaczynski said in a statement after the talk .
" he expressed his hope of continuing the political and military cooperation between our two countries .
" he also said the anti-missile shield project would go ahead . "
the us plans to build 10 interceptor missiles on polish territory and a radar facility in the czech republic by 2011 to 2013 .
the new components would complete a system already in place in the us , greenland and britain .
washington says the shield - endorsed by nato in february - is aimed at defending against potential attacks by so-called " rogue states " such as iran and north korea and would not be aimed at russia .
in response to the system , medvedev has threatened to deploy short-range iskander missiles in kaliningrad .
new financial order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls have been made for a modern bretton woods meeting to tackle the financial crisis medvedev 's comments in the french daily , which is close to the administration of president nicolas sarkozy , were published ahead of a meeting in washington on saturday to deal with the financial crisis .
medvedev said the participants must build the basis of " a new bretton woods . "
in reconstructing the world 's economic system , as the 1944 bretton woods meeting did , heads of the world 's leading industrial nations must establish " new international credit institutions , a new accounting system , a new risk insurance system , " the russian president said .
moscow had already suggested the development of a risk alert system that all countries would set up independently , he said .
medvedev said he had already shared his ideas with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
" we share the same vision about the origin of the crisis , " he said .
" we must find the solutions to stabilize and reform the system for the long term . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are prepared to drop our decision to deploy missiles at kaliningrad if the new american administration decides to abandon its anti-missile system , " he said , noting that , based on early reactions , obama was " thinking about it . "
" we hope to create frank and honest relations with the new administration and resolve problems that we were not able to resolve with the current administration , " he said .

in reconstructing the world 's economic system , as the 1944 bretton woods meeting did , heads of the world 's leading industrial nations must establish " new international credit institutions , a new accounting system , a new risk insurance system , " the russian president said .
moscow had already suggested the development of a risk alert system that all countries would set up independently , he said .
medvedev said he had already shared his ideas with french president nicolas sarkozy , british prime minister gordon brown , german chancellor angela merkel and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "
more research will be needed to determine what exact significance , if any , the breakthrough at the charite has for the overall fight against aids .

the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .

and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .
the government says the package , which includes soft loans for medium-sized industry and for home insulation as well as a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars , will stimulate 50 billion euros in spending in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's traditionally strong exports are expected to take a major hit data to be published on friday is also predicted to show france - the 15-member eurozone 's second biggest economy - also slipped into recession during the third quarter .
with the euro area 's two largest economies in recession , the european central bank is likely to face mounting pressure to follow up this month 's 50-basis-points cut with another hefty reduction in borrowing costs in december .

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated . " both operation enduring freedom and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- missions in afghanistan have been criticized by german lawmakers after recent cases of civilian deaths . in late october , german soldiers fired on a vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint wounding five afghans , and two german soldiers and five children were killed by a suicide bomber .
a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "

philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack is not yet back to full fitness after foot surgery ballack , meanwhile , has resumed training after foot surgery in mid-october , but was deemed to have had too long a break to make the cut for next wednesday 's match .
philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "

monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .

criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "
" if that 's the case , that would constitute a serious violation of international law , " she said .
nkunda 's forces captured kiwanja on nov .
5 and began sweeping the population for lingering mai mai troops who they believed were hiding among the people .
human rights watch said this week that at least 50 civilians were killed in the smoke out .
charges of violence on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been powerless to stop rebel forces to add to the civilians ' woes , some have also been targeted by government forces , the un said .
monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .
humanitarian disaster with thousands of congolese being pushed from camp to camp by the sporadic outbreaks of violence , many were not gaining access to emergency aid , humanitarian group doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- warned .
the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .
" we are concerned about the sheer size of this situation . "
the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .

the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .

in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt stock exchange has been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks germany 's blue chip dax opened 0.7 per cent lower but then recovered at mid-day to reach 4,642 , a gain of 0.5 per cent .
the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .
last week , the economics ministry said factory orders plummeted in september by 8 percent , their biggest drop since records began about 17 years ago , while industrial production sank 3.6 per cent in the same month .
in their annual report presented to chancellor angela merkel in berlin on wednesday , the german government 's panel of economic advisors predicted 2009 would be a year of recession .
the experts said that exports , the mainstay of the german economy , will drop sharply in the coming year as the world economy slows , and urged the government to take countermeasures .
biggest downturns in europe and the us meanwhile , the organisation for economic cooperation and development , the oecd , said on thursday the economies of its 30 members are likely to shrink on average by around 0.3 percent next year .
it expects the biggest downturns in the us and europe .
the american economy is expected to contract by just under one percent , european economies by half a percent .
in june , the oecd still figured with an average growth rate of 1.7 percent .
" there will be gradual recovery starting in the second half of 2009 , " but economic growth will not approach normal until the second half of 2010 , oecd director of policy studies , jorgen elmeskov , said in paris .
holger schmieding , an economist at the bank of america predicted that for germany , and the other euro zone economies , this recession is likely be the worst in 15 years .
lawmakers support stimulus package a 12-billion-euro economic-stimulus package announced by german chancellor angela merkel earlier this month won approval from almost all pro-government legislators thursday .
the government says the package , which includes soft loans for medium-sized industry and for home insulation as well as a tax rebate for purchasers of new cars , will stimulate 50 billion euros in spending in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's traditionally strong exports are expected to take a major hit data to be published on friday is also predicted to show france - the 15-member eurozone 's second biggest economy - also slipped into recession during the third quarter .
with the euro area 's two largest economies in recession , the european central bank is likely to face mounting pressure to follow up this month 's 50-basis-points cut with another hefty reduction in borrowing costs in december .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .
afghanistan mission controversial in germany the afghan aspect of the oef has been controversial in germany because of the growing number of civilians killed in military operations against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated . " both operation enduring freedom and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- missions in afghanistan have been criticized by german lawmakers after recent cases of civilian deaths . in late october , german soldiers fired on a vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint wounding five afghans , and two german soldiers and five children were killed by a suicide bomber .
a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "
more research will be needed to determine what exact significance , if any , the breakthrough at the charite has for the overall fight against aids .
today , more than 38 million people , mostly in africa and asia , are estimated to be infected with hiv , the virus which causes aids . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "

philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .

loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "

philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "

philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .
bonuses for successful qualification are also to be discussed by players and the national federation dfb . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant .

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .
afghanistan mission controversial in germany the afghan aspect of the oef has been controversial in germany because of the growing number of civilians killed in military operations against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated . " both operation enduring freedom and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- missions in afghanistan have been criticized by german lawmakers after recent cases of civilian deaths . in late october , german soldiers fired on a vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint wounding five afghans , and two german soldiers and five children were killed by a suicide bomber .
a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .
humanitarian disaster with thousands of congolese being pushed from camp to camp by the sporadic outbreaks of violence , many were not gaining access to emergency aid , humanitarian group doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- warned .
the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .
" we are concerned about the sheer size of this situation . "
the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .
many of the refugees caught up in the fierce fighting of the last two weeks were forced to flee without even basic supplies such as blankets and are now caught outside in the rainy season .
the 17,000-strong monuc force in dr congo has warned it is overstretched and undermanned .
india and pakistan have contributed the two largest military contingents to the mission .

charges of violence on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been powerless to stop rebel forces to add to the civilians ' woes , some have also been targeted by government forces , the un said .
monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .
humanitarian disaster with thousands of congolese being pushed from camp to camp by the sporadic outbreaks of violence , many were not gaining access to emergency aid , humanitarian group doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- warned .
the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .
" we are concerned about the sheer size of this situation . "
the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .
many of the refugees caught up in the fierce fighting of the last two weeks were forced to flee without even basic supplies such as blankets and are now caught outside in the rainy season .
the 17,000-strong monuc force in dr congo has warned it is overstretched and undermanned .
india and pakistan have contributed the two largest military contingents to the mission .
with only 5,400 peacekeepers in nord-kivu province , monuc head alan doss called in october for an additional 3,000 troops , a plea that has so far gone unanswered . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , at ways to strengthen crisis mechanisms and boost oil and gas stocks to respond to any disruption in supply . the 27 eu countries import natural gas from algeria and norway but rely on russia for around 30 percent of their needs , with the baltic states even more dependent on their giant neighbor . with confidence in russian policies at a low after the georgia war in august and the memory of a gas price dispute between russia and ukraine that briefly turned off gas to some european countries in 2006 , the european union is reexamining the stability of its energy supplies . " we have to do more , be more ambitious , and be even bolder to avoid the risk of energy disruption in the future , " eu energy commission andris piebalgs said .
norway to supply more to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more norwegian gas going to be headed to eu countries norway , which is not a member of the eu , said it would increase the amount of gas it exports to the bloc , prime minister jens stoltenberg said on wednesday . norwegian gas exports to the eu could increase from 100 billion cubic meters -lrb- bcm -rrb- to between 125 billion and 140 billion cubic meters by 2020 , he told reporters after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " we are going to increase our exports of natural gas to europe , and you can count on norway when it comes to energy supplies to europe , " stoltenberg told reporters . while he lent his support to the planned scanled project , which could bring norway 's gas to east to poland , stoltenberg said there were no new plans for a major pipeline to the eu . to ensure the security of energy supplies to the baltic states , an interconnection plan , covering gas , electricity and storage in 2009 , which would identify the infrastructure needed to link these nations to the rest of the eu .
such a plan would make turning off gas to baltic states without affecting western eu members impossible . the commission 's report also emphasized the development of a " southern gas corridor " to import energy from the caspian sea and middle east regions without crossing russian territory . putin : russia has options beyond eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members disagree on the importance of the nord stream pipeline the possibility of major changes to european energy policy have irritated russia , with prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday threatening to cancel plans for the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea to germany if eu members kept delaying the disputed project . " europe has to decide if it needs the pipeline or not , " putin said , adding that russia would consider investing in gas liquefaction facilities that would allow it to sell its gas on the world market . brussels has identified the 7.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- project , a joint venture involving russia 's gazprom , and germany 's e.on and basf , as an important step in securing gas supplies for europe .
but it has been criticized in poland , lithuania and estonia , which are upset at being bypassed , as well as in sweden on environmental grounds . " we need this pipeline , but if the risks are too high then there 's nothing that can be done , " piebalgs said , referring to the potential damage the pipeline could cause the environment .
" we can not lower our environmental standards . " the german government said thursday it was sticking to plans to build the pipeline and called on the disagreeing parties need to " construction discussions " to get the 1,220-km -lrb- 758-mile -rrb- pipeline built . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .
" there can be no denying that the russia-georgia conflict last august has changed the european security environment , " de hoop scheffer said .
" the unilateral recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia by russia , violating basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity , will not lead to the viable euro-atlantic security structure we seek to achieve in constructive engagement with russia . "
he voiced hopes that russia would change course on stationing missiles in its baltic enclave of kaliningrad .
estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

legislators voted 428-130 in favor of allowing troops to continue serving in operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which was set up in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
currently there are around 110 german military personnel involved in oef operations on the horn of africa and the mediterranean sea .
the missions will be extended until the end of 2009 .
no anti-terror operations in afghanistan the new mandate rescinds the mandate for german ksk special forces to serve in oef operations in afghanistan where up to 100 troops had been on call to help fight terrorism there .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had called for the end of the mandate as the elite ksk soldiers had not been deployed in oef in three years .
the special forces will still be allowed to serve with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which is under a un mandate .
the german parliament recently approved an extension of the mandate for up to to 4,500 german troops serving with isaf in afghanistan .
afghanistan mission controversial in germany the afghan aspect of the oef has been controversial in germany because of the growing number of civilians killed in military operations against the taliban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german special forces have not had a mission in afghanistan in some three years walter kolbow , deputy head of the social democratic parliamentary group , said extending the anti-terrorism mandate was the right decision because " the danger of international terrorism has yet to be eliminated . " both operation enduring freedom and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- missions in afghanistan have been criticized by german lawmakers after recent cases of civilian deaths . in late october , german soldiers fired on a vehicle that failed to stop at a checkpoint wounding five afghans , and two german soldiers and five children were killed by a suicide bomber .
a total of about 4,500 german troops are stationed in afghanistan . members of the opposition from the greens and left parties opposed the extension while chancellor angela merkel 's broad ruling coalition of social and christian democrats as well as the free-market liberal fdp voted in favor the measure . oef was a direct response to the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
it has become extremely controversial in germany and been highly unpopular with german voters and many politicians on the political left because of the high number of civilian deaths caused by the fight against taliban insurgents . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

captain michael ballack has also been sidelined for the match after undergoing a foot operation last month .
loew will use the england friendly to field three bundesliga up-and-comers - defender marvin compper and midfielder tobias weis from tsg hoffenheim and vfl wolfsburg defender marcel schaefer .
also going into the match uncapped is bremen goalie tim wiese , who will likely be backup keeper behind rene adler from bundesliga leaders bayer leverkusen .
" we want to use the last match of the year to try out a few things and to have some impressions for next year .
the three newcomers have deserved their nomination through their performance , " said loew .
frings ordeal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings , left , and coach joachim loew have made their peace frings fell out of favor with loew after accusing his coach of lacking respect for veteran players after the former was dropped for world cup qualifiers against russia and wales last month .
it was the first time the 31-year-old had not made the cut during his international career .
ballack also attacked loew over the issue , but , like frings , soon after apologized for his comments .
after resolving their differences , frings said he and loew had agreed it would be best for the team if he sat out the england clash .
" we agreed that i wo n't be there .
i told the coach during our meeting last week it would be better if i do n't come , " frings told kicker sports magazine .
loew told the german football federation web site on thursday he would “ plan without him , " but added that frings would figure in national team plans next year provided he has " good preparation and good form . "
ins and outs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack is not yet back to full fitness after foot surgery ballack , meanwhile , has resumed training after foot surgery in mid-october , but was deemed to have had too long a break to make the cut for next wednesday 's match .
philipp lahm , clemens fritz , marcell jansen and christian pander are also missing for health reasons .
of the three newcomers , schaefer , 24 , looks most likely to receive his first cap in defense , with established rearguards lahm , jansen and pander out of contention .
compper , 23 , could also be used on the left side or as a central defender .
his hoffenheim teammate weis , also 23 , could be " an alternative for the established players in midfield , " loew said .
despite not appearing on the park next wednesday , ballack , frings and lahm will nonetheless be with the team on match night .
loew is slated to use the opportunity to lay down some rules and guidelines on how he expects his players to behave for the duration of the qualification campaign for the 2010 world cup finals in south africa .
" there will be a speech to clarify a few issues , " said the coach .

three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 13.11.2008 nato assures ukraine it has not been forgotten großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ukrainian and georgian presidents are waiting in the wings for nato acceptance nato has not turned its back on ukraine and is still eager for the former soviet republic to join its ranks , the alliance ’ s head , jaap de hoop scheffer , said at high-level talks in tallinn , estonia , on thursday . in his opening speech at the gathering of nato defense ministers , secretary general de hoop scheffer said it was ukraine 's right to choose its own security alignment , free from pressure being applied by a newly assertive russia .
the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .
" there can be no denying that the russia-georgia conflict last august has changed the european security environment , " de hoop scheffer said .
" the unilateral recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia by russia , violating basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity , will not lead to the viable euro-atlantic security structure we seek to achieve in constructive engagement with russia . "
he voiced hopes that russia would change course on stationing missiles in its baltic enclave of kaliningrad .
estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .
" and we need to convey that nato is very much on track , working with countries in the east on this process of developing a europe whole and free . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .

" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "
more research will be needed to determine what exact significance , if any , the breakthrough at the charite has for the overall fight against aids .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .

defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .

12 , to acquit a lebanese student who planted a suitcase with a bomb mechanism inside it on a passenger train .
summing up their case , they said youssef mohamad e.h. , 24 , was hoaxing when he left the device on a train on july 31 , 2006 and fled the country .
he had just wanted someone to open the suitcase and get a fright .
police had told the trial , which has lasted all year , that the detonators of the two time-bombs exploded , but the gas charges had been wrongly mixed and they failed to explode .
another lebanese has already been convicted in beirut of planting the other bomb .
question of intent to kill prosecutors last month called for e.h. to be jailed for life , saying the scare was germany 's closest shave ever with an islamist terrorist attack .
both men had been upset at cartoons critical of the prophet mohammed .
the defendant is to address the court on tuesday next week and a verdict on the charge of multiple attempted murder is due from the court in dusseldorf on nov .
26 .
defense lawyer bernd rosenkranz said the accused could not be convicted if he had not intended to kill .
e.h. had helped build the bombs but the two defendants had changed their minds , realizing it was wrong to kill innocent civilians , and had deliberately loaded them with a gas mixture they knew could not explode .
the lawyer contended german federal police had exaggerated the case to back berlin 's view that germany was in danger of attack from islamist radicals .
lawyer : confession must have been forced he contended that the other plotter , jihad hamad , might have confessed as a result of a beating or threats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused were identified with the help of surveillance cameras he said it was implausible to claim that hamad turned himself in and confessed of his own volition to attempted murder .
" contritely admitting to something is not the arab way , " the lawyer said .
" it could only have been forced . "
rosenkranz said the two young men would also have thoroughly cleaned away any evidence from the cologne apartment where they built the bombs if they had truly intended to kill people .
but they left everything strewn about , including sales dockets for the gas canisters they had used .
" they just wanted to show the german public what they were capable of after the mohammed cartoons were published in germany daily newspapers , " rosenkranz said .
another defense lawyer said hamad , the other conspirator , had retracted the confession that led to his 12-year jail term in lebanon and agreed that the attack had been a hoax .
the lawyer , who met with hamad in jail , quoted him as saying it was " obvious the bombs were not meant to explode . "
claims of mistreatment while in custody hamad claimed he was beaten in custody and a lebanese prosecutor had personally threatened to have him tortured .
he had also been told his family would be summoned to see authorities if he told german investigators anything about being hit or threatened .
according to the lawyer , hamad said he and e.h. had been made " scapegoats in a german theatre show " which was " being performed as a favor to the americans . "
but a german federal prosecutor in court responded wednesday that it was " an interview with an evidential value of just about zero . "
the two men were filmed by closed-circuit tv at cologne station as they carried suitcases with the time-bombs inside aboard trains going in opposite directions .
lost-property staff discovered the two unexploded bombs .
e.h. was arrested when he returned to germany , where he had been preparing for university studies in kiel . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the oecd added to the gloom as it cut economic output forecasts for the eurozone and the us . europe 's biggest economy shrank by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 after it contracted 0.4 per cent in the three months to the end of june , the federal statistics office said .
as a result , germany will fulfil the technical definition of recession , after clocking up two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the third quarter decline , more than the 0.1 per cent analysts expected , came after a strong euro and rising oil prices slowed growth .
" a negative effect on gross domestic product resulted from foreign trade , with a strong increase in imports and weakening exports , " the statistics office said .
recession to continue until mid-2009 the last time the country 's economy was in recession was the first half of 2003 .
" it has finally become clear that germany is in recession .
this will continue until the middle of next year , " the economic research unit of commerzbank said .
" the german economy will contract considerably in the coming year . "

the economy has been in a tailspin for months , following the heady days of growth in 2006 and 2007 when a gdp of more than 2 per cent helped germany reclaim its position as europe 's economic locomotive .

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwandan president paul kagame says kabuye was on an official diplomatic trip to germany hankel said that german authorities had warned rwanda multiple times that they would be forced to react if the situation arose where one of the accused were to travel to germany on a private trip .
" to simply ignore this would have immense consequences for the german legal system , " he added .
kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .
instead , per her wishes , she will appear before a french court as soon as possible .
observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but why is germany doing the work of france and how can this be resolved ? rwandan president paul kagame on wednesday , nov .
13 , criticized the decision to arrest his chief of protocol , rose kabuye , earlier this week , saying it was a violation of his nation 's sovereignty .
" if we are to believe that any village judge in france can indict someone from rwanda , then i assume the reverse is also true , " kagame told reporters , adding that the international justice system needed to be " harmonized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose kabuye is being held at the women 's prison in frankfurt kagame was speaking at a press conference of the international telecommunication union on cybersecurity and climate change in geneva .
several thousand protesters in the rwandan capital kigali have continued demonstrations in front of the german embassy , demanding the immediate release of kabuye .
the controversy began on sunday when kabuye arrived in frankfurt , where she was immediately detained by german officials with a french warrant calling for her arrest . she is suspected along with eight other people in connection with shooting down then rwandan president juvenal habayarimana 's plane in 1994 . the incident became the catalyst for the rwandan genocide , which began just days later and left at least 800,000 tutsi and moderate hutu rwandans dead .
expert : germany forced to act in the case of kabuye , germany had a legal obligation to take her into custody , attorney gerd hankel from the hamburg institute for social research told deutsche welle .

kagame has insisted that his chief of protocol is entitled to diplomatic immunity and that she was on an official diplomatic mission to germany .
criticism of colonial powers ' jurisdiction norman paech , an expert in international law and german mp for the left party , said he was critical of the french warrant .
he admitted that france had every right to issue the warrant because two french citizens lost their lives in the attack on habyarimana 's plane , but said that applying universal jurisdiction will be seen by everyone in a different way .
" i think it will be difficult for former colonial powers to set themselves up as judge and jury over people in their former colonies , " said the lawyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many experts believe cases like this should be handled by the international criminal court only the international criminal tribunal at the hague should be allowed to deal with cases of international law , he insisted .
that 's the only way that offenders from politically strong countries would be treated the same as those who come from nations with less political clout .
but rose kabuye wo n't be going to the hague .

observers say she plans to take this opportunity to finally clear her name . rwanda to give warrants for french officials president kagame and his tutsi-led government have consistently denied that kabuye and the other suspects were responsible for shooting down the plane . instead , they blame hutu extremists , who they say were looking for a pretext to start the genocide .
kagame has also condemned france for playing what he sees as a complicit role in the genocide , and rwandan authorities say they 're close to releasing more than 20 indictments and warrants against top french officials , including the late french president francois mitterand . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , at ways to strengthen crisis mechanisms and boost oil and gas stocks to respond to any disruption in supply . the 27 eu countries import natural gas from algeria and norway but rely on russia for around 30 percent of their needs , with the baltic states even more dependent on their giant neighbor . with confidence in russian policies at a low after the georgia war in august and the memory of a gas price dispute between russia and ukraine that briefly turned off gas to some european countries in 2006 , the european union is reexamining the stability of its energy supplies . " we have to do more , be more ambitious , and be even bolder to avoid the risk of energy disruption in the future , " eu energy commission andris piebalgs said .
norway to supply more to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more norwegian gas going to be headed to eu countries norway , which is not a member of the eu , said it would increase the amount of gas it exports to the bloc , prime minister jens stoltenberg said on wednesday . norwegian gas exports to the eu could increase from 100 billion cubic meters -lrb- bcm -rrb- to between 125 billion and 140 billion cubic meters by 2020 , he told reporters after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " we are going to increase our exports of natural gas to europe , and you can count on norway when it comes to energy supplies to europe , " stoltenberg told reporters . while he lent his support to the planned scanled project , which could bring norway 's gas to east to poland , stoltenberg said there were no new plans for a major pipeline to the eu . to ensure the security of energy supplies to the baltic states , an interconnection plan , covering gas , electricity and storage in 2009 , which would identify the infrastructure needed to link these nations to the rest of the eu .
such a plan would make turning off gas to baltic states without affecting western eu members impossible . the commission 's report also emphasized the development of a " southern gas corridor " to import energy from the caspian sea and middle east regions without crossing russian territory . putin : russia has options beyond eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members disagree on the importance of the nord stream pipeline the possibility of major changes to european energy policy have irritated russia , with prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday threatening to cancel plans for the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea to germany if eu members kept delaying the disputed project . " europe has to decide if it needs the pipeline or not , " putin said , adding that russia would consider investing in gas liquefaction facilities that would allow it to sell its gas on the world market . brussels has identified the 7.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- project , a joint venture involving russia 's gazprom , and germany 's e.on and basf , as an important step in securing gas supplies for europe .
but it has been criticized in poland , lithuania and estonia , which are upset at being bypassed , as well as in sweden on environmental grounds . " we need this pipeline , but if the risks are too high then there 's nothing that can be done , " piebalgs said , referring to the potential damage the pipeline could cause the environment .
" we can not lower our environmental standards .

" we have to do more , be more ambitious , and be even bolder to avoid the risk of energy disruption in the future , " eu energy commission andris piebalgs said .
norway to supply more to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more norwegian gas going to be headed to eu countries norway , which is not a member of the eu , said it would increase the amount of gas it exports to the bloc , prime minister jens stoltenberg said on wednesday . norwegian gas exports to the eu could increase from 100 billion cubic meters -lrb- bcm -rrb- to between 125 billion and 140 billion cubic meters by 2020 , he told reporters after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " we are going to increase our exports of natural gas to europe , and you can count on norway when it comes to energy supplies to europe , " stoltenberg told reporters . while he lent his support to the planned scanled project , which could bring norway 's gas to east to poland , stoltenberg said there were no new plans for a major pipeline to the eu . to ensure the security of energy supplies to the baltic states , an interconnection plan , covering gas , electricity and storage in 2009 , which would identify the infrastructure needed to link these nations to the rest of the eu .
such a plan would make turning off gas to baltic states without affecting western eu members impossible . the commission 's report also emphasized the development of a " southern gas corridor " to import energy from the caspian sea and middle east regions without crossing russian territory . putin : russia has options beyond eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members disagree on the importance of the nord stream pipeline the possibility of major changes to european energy policy have irritated russia , with prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday threatening to cancel plans for the nord stream gas pipeline under the baltic sea to germany if eu members kept delaying the disputed project . " europe has to decide if it needs the pipeline or not , " putin said , adding that russia would consider investing in gas liquefaction facilities that would allow it to sell its gas on the world market . brussels has identified the 7.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.2 billion -rrb- project , a joint venture involving russia 's gazprom , and germany 's e.on and basf , as an important step in securing gas supplies for europe .
but it has been criticized in poland , lithuania and estonia , which are upset at being bypassed , as well as in sweden on environmental grounds . " we need this pipeline , but if the risks are too high then there 's nothing that can be done , " piebalgs said , referring to the potential damage the pipeline could cause the environment .
" we can not lower our environmental standards . " the german government said thursday it was sticking to plans to build the pipeline and called on the disagreeing parties need to " construction discussions " to get the 1,220-km -lrb- 758-mile -rrb- pipeline built . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers met to specificially discuss ukraine 's bid for nato membership .
" let me remind you that at the bucharest summit earlier this year , nato heads of state and government welcomed ukraine euro-atlantic aspirations for membership in nato and agreed that ukraine will become a member of the alliance , " he said .
he was highly critical of russia 's actions during and after its brief august war with georgia .
" there can be no denying that the russia-georgia conflict last august has changed the european security environment , " de hoop scheffer said .
" the unilateral recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia by russia , violating basic principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity , will not lead to the viable euro-atlantic security structure we seek to achieve in constructive engagement with russia . "
he voiced hopes that russia would change course on stationing missiles in its baltic enclave of kaliningrad .
estonia backs ukraine for nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has strongly backed ukrainian membership estonian president toomas hendrik ilves used the meeting to urge fellow nato members to embrace kiev 's desire to join the alliance , an effort he said was a “ litmus test ” for european security .
ukraine , along with georgia , has gravitated towards nato and is seeking a so-called membership action plan -lrb- map -rrb- - the work plan originally designed to guide the baltic states towards eventual alliance membership .
but the moves have deeply angered russia , which considers ukraine and georgia within its sphere of influence .
" the fact that ukraine is here today with nato ministers of defence should convince everyone that nato understands ukraine 's importance to european security , " ilves said .
" i can assure you that nato remains committed to the protection of europe 's security .
this is why we will never abandon democratic ukraine - an integral pillar of the european security architecture .
" we should consider how to move beyond the current deadlock over timelines and political symbols . "
mixed views on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel says time is not right for georgian or ukrainian maps us defense secretary robert gates was also in attendance at the talks , signaling his country 's support for georgian and ukrainian membership , a defense secretary staffer said thursday .
but the official said ukraine 's membership bid was complicated by several domestic issues which showed no sign of abating .
these included a lack of public support in ukraine for membership , a spate of internal political crises and the trouble the country was having increasing the capacity of its military to enable it to cooperate with nato forces .
support for further nato expansion is mixed , with german chancellor angela merkel saying in october it was too soon to offer either georgia or ukraine an map .
the us official said , however , that nato membership for the former soviet republics was important to show that russia had not succeeded in splitting europe after its invasion of georgia .
" and we need to convey that nato is very much on track , working with countries in the east on this process of developing a europe whole and free . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in total , the 73-year-old is charged with six crimes . prosecutors at the court in sankt poelten in austria said fritz was responsible for the death of the infant boy born in the dungeon beneath his house in 1996 , as he had " neglected to call the necessary help by third parties , although he was aware of the life-threatening situation of the infant . " according to media reports , fritzl burned the newborn 's body in an oven . fritz found psychologically deviant in april this year , fritzl 's daughter elisabeth , 42 , and three of her children were freed from their underground prison which fritzl had built .
three more children which she bore in the dungeon were living upstairs with the suspect and his wife in the town of amstetten . the case made headlines around the world , prompting worries in austria that it might tarnish the country 's image . in addition to murder , fritzl also faces charges of enslavement as he abducted and locked up his daughter and made her totally dependent , the prosecution said . in the trial expected for early next year , fritzl will also be held responsible for holding his four prisoners captive by threatening them with explosive traps . fritzl forced his victims to live in a cramped , damp cellar prison of his house without windows , sunlight , or direct fresh air supply , the prosecutors said . although fritzl was certifiably sane and could be held responsible for his actions , the court-appointed psychiatrist has found him psychologically deviant .
the prosecution therefore demanded that he be imprisoned in an institution for mentally anomalous delinquents . under austrian law , criminals convicted of multiple crimes do not serve cumulative sentences , but only the most severe of their several possible punishments . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" monuc has noticed since yesterday -lrb- tuesday -rrb- evening that the vast majority of displaced who were sheltering around the base at kiwanja have left their temporary camp , " monuc spokeswoman sylvie van der wildenberg said .
" we have strong fears that these people have been forced to go back -lrb- to their homes -rrb- , " she said , adding that monuc had reports " indicating that the -lrb- rebels -rrb- told them to leave the area . "
" if that 's the case , that would constitute a serious violation of international law , " she said .
nkunda 's forces captured kiwanja on nov .

human rights watch said this week that at least 50 civilians were killed in the smoke out .
charges of violence on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has been powerless to stop rebel forces to add to the civilians ' woes , some have also been targeted by government forces , the un said .
monuc troops said tuesday that government soldiers looted from civilians in the kanyabayonga area , 175 kilometers north of the nord-kivu regional capital goma , as they retreated from a rumored rebel advance .
the troops were also accused of raping women .
kinshasa pledged on wednesday to punish the troops involved in the reported crimes .
" whoever committed acts of violence will be punished , " government spokesman lambert mende told news agency afp .
the violence is also said to have spread to the towns of kaina and kirumba further north and only subsided when senior officers in the armed forces of the dr congo took measures to restrain their troops .
humanitarian disaster with thousands of congolese being pushed from camp to camp by the sporadic outbreaks of violence , many were not gaining access to emergency aid , humanitarian group doctors without borders -lrb- msf -rrb- warned .
the world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has provided food to the displaced living in refugee camps around goma but the poor security situation has prevented the delivery of aid to those stranded behind rebel lines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross has been distributing aid to displaced people " there are huge unmet needs , " erna van goor , head of msf 's mission in goma , told german news agency dpa .
" we are concerned about the sheer size of this situation . "
the wfp said it distributed emergency rations this week to 140,000 people living in six camps around goma , including the largest camp at kibati , just north of the city .
now the agency is planning to penetrate rebel lines to rutshuru and kiwanja , two of the towns seized by the rebels in its offensive , later this week .
however , it has no clear idea of the scale of the task awaiting it .
" it is difficult to tell how many people there are because there has been so much movement , but we know there were 60,000 displaced living in camps in the area -lrb- before the rebel advance -rrb- , " marcus prior , a wfp spokesman in nairobi , told dpa .
cholera has also broken out among the displaced , although msf said it was so far managing to treat the majority of those suffering from the disease .
mission head calls for more un troops civilians have been caught in the middle of heavy clashes since rebel forces led by general nkunda began a major offensive over two weeks ago , routing the congolese army .
aid agencies say that renewed fighting between nkunda 's national congress for the defense of the people -lrb- cndp -rrb- and government forces has displaced a total of 250,000 people since late august .
many of the refugees caught up in the fierce fighting of the last two weeks were forced to flee without even basic supplies such as blankets and are now caught outside in the rainy season .
the 17,000-strong monuc force in dr congo has warned it is overstretched and undermanned .
india and pakistan have contributed the two largest military contingents to the mission .
with only 5,400 peacekeepers in nord-kivu province , monuc head alan doss called in october for an additional 3,000 troops , a plea that has so far gone unanswered . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this could yield a new direction in the fight against aids . the patient in question was a 42-year-old american living in berlin who was undergoing a bone marrow transplant at that city 's charite hospital .
the bone-marrow donors were selected because they possessed a rare hiv-resistant genetic mutation since the man had to stop taking aids-inhibiting medication for the cancer treatment to work .
on wednesday , nov .
12 , doctors announced that after two years of treatment , not only had the patient not contracted aids - his blood now appeared to be clear of hiv infection .
" there is no longer demonstrable evidence that the patient is infected , " eckhard thiel , director of charite 's clinic for hematology and oncology , told reporters .
" we 're very happy and proud to have achieved this breakthrough . "
thiel added that the result was the first of its kind ever recorded in the world .
the question is now : what could it mean in the search for a cure for hiv-aids ?
no immediate remedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2 million people died of aids in 2005 scientists cautioned that the fact that the hiv virus can no longer be detected in the patient 's blood stream does not necessarily mean it is absent from his entire body .
" the hiv virus could be in the spleen , the lymph nodes , the nerve cells - anywhere really , " norbert brockmeyer , a clinic director at the university hospital of bochum , told the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel .
and even if effective against hiv , several factors argue against the idea that similar treatments could be carried out on a wide-spread basis .
bone marrow transplants and the accompanying chemotherapy are themselves dangerous procedures , and the patient in question was fortunate in having a genetic make-up that allowed for an unusually high number of potential donors .
charite doctors say they are monitoring the patient 's health and are prepared to put him back on anti-retroviral drugs if the hiv infection reappears .
" we can not say with certainty that the virus wo n't begin replicating itself in the future , " thomas schneider , charite 's director of infectology , told a press conference .
" but the mere fact that it has n't yet done so , is a minor sensation . "
more research will be needed to determine what exact significance , if any , the breakthrough at the charite has for the overall fight against aids .

by bridget kendall bbc diplomatic correspondent a deep-seated global crisis is often a chance to redraw the map , reflecting shifts in the balance of power in different ways .
first , the crisis can confirm or nudge ahead trends which seem to be happening anyway - like the shift of power from western to emerging eastern players .
second , it can put flesh on reforms already in the air - like plans to overhaul the international financial architecture to be discussed at this weekend 's summit being hosted by president bush in washington .
china is the latest large economy to announce an economic stimulus plan and third , there are the instinctive emergency reactions , supposedly temporary , but which can end up reshaping the global chessboard for years to come - the hurried nationalisation of some western banks , for instance , or possibly iceland 's desperate bailout appeal to russia - a nato member putting financial survival ahead of any security provisos .
of course to draw firm conclusions at this point , with the economic crisis far from over , is a risky venture .
but some patterns merit closer examination .
first , is the balance of power in the world really shifting eastwards ?
it is a question that has been the subject of much debate recently on the discussion programme the forum which i host for the bbc world service .
my guests ' general conclusion seems to be that , yes , asia is on the rise , and the economic woes of the us and europe have exposed the fragility of western banking and the vulnerability of western economies .
china and india have been less affected .
and , even if demand for chinese goods slows , its mammoth economy can still be a powerful engine of growth and a much needed source of liquidity .
russian nerves and yet , in a world so interdependent economically , can any part be immune ?
especially given the symbiotic relationship between china and the united states - " chimerica " as the harvard historian niall ferguson calls it : not two financial systems , but one .
economists including jm keynes negotiate the bretton woods agreements in these terms , surely if the american and other western economies have succumbed to a chronic bout of sneezing , flu for china and rest of world is inescapable ?
moreover , perhaps we should not overstate the resilience of emerging economies .
look no further than moscow , where the stock market panic and flight of capital abroad have been dramatic , and the fall in world oil prices has added to the economy 's battering .
despite russia 's legendary energy wealth , there is a new nervous uncertainty among local businessmen who - one suspects - know more than most about the way the domestic economy remains weakened by corruption and a labyrinthine smoke-and-mirrors way of doing business .
a second question worth pondering - just how likely is it that this weekend 's top-level meeting really will generate reform of the world 's leading financial institutions ?
bridget kendall 1998 to present : bbc diplomatic correspondent 1994-98 : washington correspondent 1989-94 : moscow correspondent more about bridget there is grand talk of a ' bretton woods two ' , a vision for a new financial system pushed for some time by , among others , britain 's gordon brown .
true , there is broad agreement on an agenda to seek ways to forestall a global recession , devise an early warning system and consider more international regulation .
but the leaders from 20 of the world 's largest economies bring to the table a variety of conflicting interests , some motivated by practical need , others by ideological considerations , some looking for short term fixes - the move from private to state control of banks for instance - which others view as a desirable long term objective .
top table reform so is major reform feasible ?
is the current economic crisis cataclysmic enough yet to be truly transformational ?
the europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency .
the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
but a rift has opened up between those like the french president , nicolas sarkozy , who seek permanent global oversight of financial transactions , and wary anglo-saxon governments - including above all the us administration - which fear that too much control could hamper the workings of the free market .
and even if that hurdle is surmounted , could any us president , even one enjoying such goodwill as president-elect barack obama , win congressional backing for a toothy regulatory body that would have real oversight of us institutions ?
whether the issue is international crimes against humanity or attempts to regulate carbon emissions , the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
russian president medvedev blames american policies for the current crisis meanwhile , the powerhouse nations of the so-called bric group - brazil , russia , india and china - and the petro-states of the gulf -lrb- armed with the bargaining chip of sovereign wealth funds -rrb- have made it clear that what they want is recognition that the old elite clubs dominated by western nations no longer reflect reality .
logic would suggest this means reform of the top tables not just at the imf and the world bank , but an enlargement of the g8 -lrb- group of eight most industrialised countries -rrb- , and the united nations security council .
fine in theory .
but in practice reforming the g8 is probably easiest .
already the annual summit opens its doors to other players .
and the 2009 host , italy 's silvio berlusconi , has made it known he intends to invite the g20 countries to his g8 sardinia party .
but the weary process of reform at the un has left many jaundiced .
it is hard to imagine the mechanism which would require current global powers to agree to anything but a symbolic change .
the bretton woods agreements agreed in july 1944 , but not all of them operative until 1959 creation of the imf and ibrd -lrb- now part of world bank -rrb- encouraged open markets obligation to maintain currency exchange rates within fixed values -lrb- to + / - 1 % -rrb- likewise at the world bank and the imf , the hard bargaining will revolve not just around which new countries get seats on the board , but whether they will be allowed to upset the current balance of power when it comes to decision-making .
note that already there are voices warning that too many players will make any new arrangement dysfunctional .
there are other complications .
russia continues to agitate for any adjustment that will lessen us influence , whether in financial or european security matters .
no doubt president medvedev will want to repeat his and mr putin 's belief that the root cause of the current financial crisis lies in american unilateralism following the end of the cold war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks - an ideological argument that may irritate rather than persuade and make consensus even harder to achieve .
safety in numbers and a third area of examination - what do the emergency reactions to the financial crisis so far tell us about the way the world may be heading ?
reactions seem to boil down to a choice of two - whether to conclude that in times of trouble safety lies in numbers and it is better to be part of a bigger bloc , or whether when the going gets hard , it is better to look after your own - the protectionist , nationalist instinct .
certainly some people seem to be concluding that size is the best security against future risk .
in beleaguered iceland , where six months ago opinion suggested a majority were against eu membership , those in favour of throwing their lot in with the eu has crept above 50 % .
a similar trend in scandinavia is leading the governments in denmark and possibly sweden to wonder if they should think again about offering a referendum on joining the euro .
in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
and in scotland , too , recent polls have suggested support for the scottish nationalist party 's vision of independence has lost ground .
going it alone , it seems , no longer looks so attractive in the wake of a financial crisis .
but at the same time , eu cohesiveness has taken a knocking .
despite early declarations of eu economic solidarity , it did n't take long for ireland to break ranks and offer a unilateral guarantee to depositors to forestall a run on its banks , or for germany to hint it would take similar action .
and disorderly eu bickering ahead of the washington summit has rather belied claims of european unity .
and in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
fears for poor for all the high hopes of turning this crisis to advantage , to push through reforms that otherwise would never have been contemplated , there is a danger it could pivot in the opposite direction .
and if this crisis ushers in greater protectionism , it could mean an end to an era of generosity and less concern for the welfare of others .
for the last decade it has been the very poor who have dominated the agenda of the world bank and the imf .
not any more .
in the last two months , it has been iceland , hungary , ukraine and pakistan knocking at the imf door .
already the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has sounded the alarm that his ambitious un millennium goals to slash poverty , illiteracy and disease run the risk of being neglected .
this could ' threaten to undermine all our achievements ' he said recently .
just this week the world food programme warned it was having to cut food aid to impoverished zimbabweans due to a lack of international donations .
a harbinger of things to come , perhaps .
and there is a broader implication - that it may become increasingly difficult to persuade nations to sign up for large-scale interventions to help the desperate and the victimised .
if a global recession can not be avoided , the united nations ' much vaunted " responsibility to protect " , only recently enacted , may end up already becoming an outdated aspiration .
you can listen to the bbc world service 's the forum with bridget kendall here .
your comments : the crisis will have low or any impact on international relations .
the governments have to stop pushing money into the banking system immediately and use it to support companies -lrb- not financial -rrb- and create new workplaces ervin , brno , czech republic subsidies will end for the developed world .
developing countries produce will be marketable in those developed countries .
the farmers in developed countries will be discouraged and will shunt farming due to poor returns .
developing countries , especially african economies will prosper .
developed countries ' exports will diminish in sales volumes to developing countries .
availability of cheap raw materials for the bug economies will decrease .
elphas moni , kampala , uganda i have been having a feeling lately that the current financial crisis is just another one off event and the situation will normalise soon .
the countries bickering about the us influence seem to be taking advantage of its current financial failings-which is a rather ill fated short term proposition .
more emphasis should be concentrated on what led to the current situation , .i.e. lavish credit from banks , ' cooked books ' from financial institutions etc ...
the chinese , though not there yet , have shown that we can regulate capitalism to the good of everyone .
but all in all the financial crisis is over hyped and it will therefore have negligible effect on the balance of power .
charles lukwago , kampala , uganda this is regarding a new multipolar world order chetan singh , dehradun , india let 's hope this trend signals the end of the dominance of the illuminati in europe and the us !
maurice , paris , france the financial crisis will affect international relations positively .
as the famous saying goes , adversity is a blessing in disguise .
the great financial crisis is serving as an eye opener to those who assumed that without investing in sustainable growth pre-requisites , profits can be harnessed forever .
they are being proved wrong .
madan gopal sharma , olten , switzerland your article is very interesting , focusing on the materialistic aspects of life -lrb- money , power , control etc -rrb- but it leaves out the more important aspect of humanity , its spiritual reality -lrb- compassion , justice , ethic , respect , truthfulness and many more . -rrb- .
there definitely needs to be a balance between the material and spiritual , otherwise civilisation as we are experiencing it in these days , will be doomed ... as happened to great civilisations of past ages .
paula van den boogaart , nuernberg , germany i would like to see more g-20 than g-7 , or 8 's .
also , more countries involved in the decisions of the planet , after all we are in this together .
the less government involvement in a free market , the better off the free market is , take the pain .
david eaton , las vegas , usa i think that balance of powers will tend to eastern nations but it is a matter of time -lrb- we do not know how many time -rrb- that that balance tends back to western nations again .
i think all nations should work together without thinking about particular interests like the usa and china , that consume lots of fossil fuel .
rising nations like brazil and india must be considered in all these international discussions about the economy etc .
gustavo pontello , araraquara , brazil the financial crisis has shaken many countries in the last few weeks , it has opened the eyes of the world on how the financial system was structured over the last 50 years .
the fall of the us economy and its domino effect on the rest of the world has proven one thing : the system was created to basically support them .
now , the leaders of the world 's biggest economy should learn to define the meaning of " balance " in this world .
they must set clear parameters to define how we can all affect each other .
mark carbungco , jakarta , indonesia clearly there can not be economic cooperation while politically there is so much sparring going on .
the most basic and essential step is for the us to stop entertaining this ridiculous idea that it is some kind of global superpower which has to control the world .
accordingly , obama 's first task is to unwind all the lunatic strategies bush embarked on - starting with abandoning plans to install missile shields in poland -lrb- clearly a breach of the non-proliferation pact and sure to restart cold war activities -rrb- .
russia should and would respond by toning down their own military enhancements .
this will help improve economic cooperation and free up some funds for more constructive purposes .
peter , townsville , australia i think the world blames the financial collapse on the u.s. , and for good reason .
we sold out our industrial base and the only thing we have left to export is debt .
now we are broke with no hope of recovery because we no longer produce or save .
an economy based on debt and consumption is unsustainable .
the " free trade " and globalist movement has been the biggest rip-off in world history , and the u.s. will default on the behemoth debt owed to china , russia , and the arabs .
the only ones benefitting from this whole mess are the criminal banker-elites who are looting our treasury for " bailouts " .
the american people are not blameless , however .
we lived beyond our means and allowed our governing officials to run wild with their corporate partners in crime .
after all , we were too busy with soccer games and trips to the mall to mind the " for the people , by the people " store .
america will be reduced to 3rd-world ashes by 2012 without a single shot ever needing to be fired .
ann minch , red bluff , ca -lrb- usa -rrb- great article except for the absence of any reference to japan .
this is strange on 3 counts .
first , it is the second biggest economy in the world-how can you possibly discuss the global economy without reference to it ?
second , to support your argument i would have thought japan's own rise post ww2 already suggested the movement away from west towards east long before china .
third , given japan's own financial sector woes in 1990 i thought this would be a good moot point for global discussion as to solving current crisis .
nicholas cunningham , australia what should governments of developed countries do ? 1 .
acknowledge that macroeconomic frameworks can be sustained only on strong foundations of microeconomic efficiencies .
the genesis of the present crisis is that financial superstructure has moved too far away from the real sectors of the economy .
2 .
set good examples of fiscal prudence ; current expenditures must be contained within current revenues ; only capital expenditures should be used to inflate or deflate the economy .
3 .
realise that " trickle down " strategies have failed miserably ; must work out stimulus packages that will work bottom up .
for a start , each of the citizens should be given a ' basic grant ' fixed at half the poverty level .
sastry kambhampati , hyderabad , india re : world food programme and zimbabwe - does this seem feasible : instead of shipping food -lrb- and money -rrb- from the west to feed impoverished zimbabweans , to actually have the un set up large scale farming on land garnered from the white farmers ?
the land remains zimbabwean and in time the management of these farms can revert to the locals .
martin peros , toronto , canada we like it or not capitalism and free-enterprise is the only successful economic system we have and free world trade is the only vehicle to achieve universal wealth .
the system is obviously not perfect but the best we 've got and the result of centuries of trial and error socio-economic evolution not the creation of any human mind .
our economy is far too complex and changing for any human mind or minds to embrace it , much less to predict and control it .
one more proof of this is watching the spectacle of world bureaucrats trying desperately to stop the crisis with little or no results .
nobody knows the solutions because nobody can understand the complexities of the rapidly evolving economic reality .
lucas antuna , san pedro , paraguay i think we need to head towards ' total socialism ' for all countries - what we extract from the grounds of poor nations should go mainly to their wealth , health and happiness and not to shareholders - hospitals and infrastructure should be all ' state owned ' and non profiting - all land should be state owned and state controlled and leased and never used as an asset or passed on to relatives .

more emphasis should be concentrated on what led to the current situation , .i.e. lavish credit from banks , ' cooked books ' from financial institutions etc ...
the chinese , though not there yet , have shown that we can regulate capitalism to the good of everyone .
but all in all the financial crisis is over hyped and it will therefore have negligible effect on the balance of power .
charles lukwago , kampala , uganda this is regarding a new multipolar world order chetan singh , dehradun , india let 's hope this trend signals the end of the dominance of the illuminati in europe and the us !
maurice , paris , france the financial crisis will affect international relations positively .
as the famous saying goes , adversity is a blessing in disguise .
the great financial crisis is serving as an eye opener to those who assumed that without investing in sustainable growth pre-requisites , profits can be harnessed forever .
they are being proved wrong .
madan gopal sharma , olten , switzerland your article is very interesting , focusing on the materialistic aspects of life -lrb- money , power , control etc -rrb- but it leaves out the more important aspect of humanity , its spiritual reality -lrb- compassion , justice , ethic , respect , truthfulness and many more . -rrb- .
there definitely needs to be a balance between the material and spiritual , otherwise civilisation as we are experiencing it in these days , will be doomed ... as happened to great civilisations of past ages .
paula van den boogaart , nuernberg , germany i would like to see more g-20 than g-7 , or 8 's .
also , more countries involved in the decisions of the planet , after all we are in this together .
the less government involvement in a free market , the better off the free market is , take the pain .
david eaton , las vegas , usa i think that balance of powers will tend to eastern nations but it is a matter of time -lrb- we do not know how many time -rrb- that that balance tends back to western nations again .
i think all nations should work together without thinking about particular interests like the usa and china , that consume lots of fossil fuel .
rising nations like brazil and india must be considered in all these international discussions about the economy etc .
gustavo pontello , araraquara , brazil the financial crisis has shaken many countries in the last few weeks , it has opened the eyes of the world on how the financial system was structured over the last 50 years .
the fall of the us economy and its domino effect on the rest of the world has proven one thing : the system was created to basically support them .
now , the leaders of the world 's biggest economy should learn to define the meaning of " balance " in this world .
they must set clear parameters to define how we can all affect each other .
mark carbungco , jakarta , indonesia clearly there can not be economic cooperation while politically there is so much sparring going on .
the most basic and essential step is for the us to stop entertaining this ridiculous idea that it is some kind of global superpower which has to control the world .
accordingly , obama 's first task is to unwind all the lunatic strategies bush embarked on - starting with abandoning plans to install missile shields in poland -lrb- clearly a breach of the non-proliferation pact and sure to restart cold war activities -rrb- .
russia should and would respond by toning down their own military enhancements .
this will help improve economic cooperation and free up some funds for more constructive purposes .
peter , townsville , australia i think the world blames the financial collapse on the u.s. , and for good reason .
we sold out our industrial base and the only thing we have left to export is debt .
now we are broke with no hope of recovery because we no longer produce or save .
an economy based on debt and consumption is unsustainable .
the " free trade " and globalist movement has been the biggest rip-off in world history , and the u.s. will default on the behemoth debt owed to china , russia , and the arabs .
the only ones benefitting from this whole mess are the criminal banker-elites who are looting our treasury for " bailouts " .
the american people are not blameless , however .
we lived beyond our means and allowed our governing officials to run wild with their corporate partners in crime .
after all , we were too busy with soccer games and trips to the mall to mind the " for the people , by the people " store .
america will be reduced to 3rd-world ashes by 2012 without a single shot ever needing to be fired .
ann minch , red bluff , ca -lrb- usa -rrb- great article except for the absence of any reference to japan .
this is strange on 3 counts .
first , it is the second biggest economy in the world-how can you possibly discuss the global economy without reference to it ?
second , to support your argument i would have thought japan's own rise post ww2 already suggested the movement away from west towards east long before china .
third , given japan's own financial sector woes in 1990 i thought this would be a good moot point for global discussion as to solving current crisis .
nicholas cunningham , australia what should governments of developed countries do ? 1 .
acknowledge that macroeconomic frameworks can be sustained only on strong foundations of microeconomic efficiencies .
the genesis of the present crisis is that financial superstructure has moved too far away from the real sectors of the economy .
2 .
set good examples of fiscal prudence ; current expenditures must be contained within current revenues ; only capital expenditures should be used to inflate or deflate the economy .
3 .
realise that " trickle down " strategies have failed miserably ; must work out stimulus packages that will work bottom up .
for a start , each of the citizens should be given a ' basic grant ' fixed at half the poverty level .
sastry kambhampati , hyderabad , india re : world food programme and zimbabwe - does this seem feasible : instead of shipping food -lrb- and money -rrb- from the west to feed impoverished zimbabweans , to actually have the un set up large scale farming on land garnered from the white farmers ?
the land remains zimbabwean and in time the management of these farms can revert to the locals .
martin peros , toronto , canada we like it or not capitalism and free-enterprise is the only successful economic system we have and free world trade is the only vehicle to achieve universal wealth .
the system is obviously not perfect but the best we 've got and the result of centuries of trial and error socio-economic evolution not the creation of any human mind .
our economy is far too complex and changing for any human mind or minds to embrace it , much less to predict and control it .
one more proof of this is watching the spectacle of world bureaucrats trying desperately to stop the crisis with little or no results .
nobody knows the solutions because nobody can understand the complexities of the rapidly evolving economic reality .
lucas antuna , san pedro , paraguay i think we need to head towards ' total socialism ' for all countries - what we extract from the grounds of poor nations should go mainly to their wealth , health and happiness and not to shareholders - hospitals and infrastructure should be all ' state owned ' and non profiting - all land should be state owned and state controlled and leased and never used as an asset or passed on to relatives .

by bridget kendall bbc diplomatic correspondent a deep-seated global crisis is often a chance to redraw the map , reflecting shifts in the balance of power in different ways .
first , the crisis can confirm or nudge ahead trends which seem to be happening anyway - like the shift of power from western to emerging eastern players .
second , it can put flesh on reforms already in the air - like plans to overhaul the international financial architecture to be discussed at this weekend 's summit being hosted by president bush in washington .
china is the latest large economy to announce an economic stimulus plan and third , there are the instinctive emergency reactions , supposedly temporary , but which can end up reshaping the global chessboard for years to come - the hurried nationalisation of some western banks , for instance , or possibly iceland 's desperate bailout appeal to russia - a nato member putting financial survival ahead of any security provisos .
of course to draw firm conclusions at this point , with the economic crisis far from over , is a risky venture .
but some patterns merit closer examination .
first , is the balance of power in the world really shifting eastwards ?
it is a question that has been the subject of much debate recently on the discussion programme the forum which i host for the bbc world service .
my guests ' general conclusion seems to be that , yes , asia is on the rise , and the economic woes of the us and europe have exposed the fragility of western banking and the vulnerability of western economies .
china and india have been less affected .
and , even if demand for chinese goods slows , its mammoth economy can still be a powerful engine of growth and a much needed source of liquidity .
russian nerves and yet , in a world so interdependent economically , can any part be immune ?
especially given the symbiotic relationship between china and the united states - " chimerica " as the harvard historian niall ferguson calls it : not two financial systems , but one .
economists including jm keynes negotiate the bretton woods agreements in these terms , surely if the american and other western economies have succumbed to a chronic bout of sneezing , flu for china and rest of world is inescapable ?
moreover , perhaps we should not overstate the resilience of emerging economies .
look no further than moscow , where the stock market panic and flight of capital abroad have been dramatic , and the fall in world oil prices has added to the economy 's battering .
despite russia 's legendary energy wealth , there is a new nervous uncertainty among local businessmen who - one suspects - know more than most about the way the domestic economy remains weakened by corruption and a labyrinthine smoke-and-mirrors way of doing business .
a second question worth pondering - just how likely is it that this weekend 's top-level meeting really will generate reform of the world 's leading financial institutions ?
bridget kendall 1998 to present : bbc diplomatic correspondent 1994-98 : washington correspondent 1989-94 : moscow correspondent more about bridget there is grand talk of a ' bretton woods two ' , a vision for a new financial system pushed for some time by , among others , britain 's gordon brown .
true , there is broad agreement on an agenda to seek ways to forestall a global recession , devise an early warning system and consider more international regulation .
but the leaders from 20 of the world 's largest economies bring to the table a variety of conflicting interests , some motivated by practical need , others by ideological considerations , some looking for short term fixes - the move from private to state control of banks for instance - which others view as a desirable long term objective .
top table reform so is major reform feasible ?
is the current economic crisis cataclysmic enough yet to be truly transformational ?
the europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency .
the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
but a rift has opened up between those like the french president , nicolas sarkozy , who seek permanent global oversight of financial transactions , and wary anglo-saxon governments - including above all the us administration - which fear that too much control could hamper the workings of the free market .
and even if that hurdle is surmounted , could any us president , even one enjoying such goodwill as president-elect barack obama , win congressional backing for a toothy regulatory body that would have real oversight of us institutions ?
whether the issue is international crimes against humanity or attempts to regulate carbon emissions , the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
russian president medvedev blames american policies for the current crisis meanwhile , the powerhouse nations of the so-called bric group - brazil , russia , india and china - and the petro-states of the gulf -lrb- armed with the bargaining chip of sovereign wealth funds -rrb- have made it clear that what they want is recognition that the old elite clubs dominated by western nations no longer reflect reality .
logic would suggest this means reform of the top tables not just at the imf and the world bank , but an enlargement of the g8 -lrb- group of eight most industrialised countries -rrb- , and the united nations security council .
fine in theory .
but in practice reforming the g8 is probably easiest .
already the annual summit opens its doors to other players .
and the 2009 host , italy 's silvio berlusconi , has made it known he intends to invite the g20 countries to his g8 sardinia party .
but the weary process of reform at the un has left many jaundiced .
it is hard to imagine the mechanism which would require current global powers to agree to anything but a symbolic change .
the bretton woods agreements agreed in july 1944 , but not all of them operative until 1959 creation of the imf and ibrd -lrb- now part of world bank -rrb- encouraged open markets obligation to maintain currency exchange rates within fixed values -lrb- to + / - 1 % -rrb- likewise at the world bank and the imf , the hard bargaining will revolve not just around which new countries get seats on the board , but whether they will be allowed to upset the current balance of power when it comes to decision-making .
note that already there are voices warning that too many players will make any new arrangement dysfunctional .
there are other complications .
russia continues to agitate for any adjustment that will lessen us influence , whether in financial or european security matters .
no doubt president medvedev will want to repeat his and mr putin 's belief that the root cause of the current financial crisis lies in american unilateralism following the end of the cold war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks - an ideological argument that may irritate rather than persuade and make consensus even harder to achieve .
safety in numbers and a third area of examination - what do the emergency reactions to the financial crisis so far tell us about the way the world may be heading ?
reactions seem to boil down to a choice of two - whether to conclude that in times of trouble safety lies in numbers and it is better to be part of a bigger bloc , or whether when the going gets hard , it is better to look after your own - the protectionist , nationalist instinct .
certainly some people seem to be concluding that size is the best security against future risk .
in beleaguered iceland , where six months ago opinion suggested a majority were against eu membership , those in favour of throwing their lot in with the eu has crept above 50 % .
a similar trend in scandinavia is leading the governments in denmark and possibly sweden to wonder if they should think again about offering a referendum on joining the euro .
in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
and in scotland , too , recent polls have suggested support for the scottish nationalist party 's vision of independence has lost ground .
going it alone , it seems , no longer looks so attractive in the wake of a financial crisis .
but at the same time , eu cohesiveness has taken a knocking .
despite early declarations of eu economic solidarity , it did n't take long for ireland to break ranks and offer a unilateral guarantee to depositors to forestall a run on its banks , or for germany to hint it would take similar action .
and disorderly eu bickering ahead of the washington summit has rather belied claims of european unity .
and in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
fears for poor for all the high hopes of turning this crisis to advantage , to push through reforms that otherwise would never have been contemplated , there is a danger it could pivot in the opposite direction .
and if this crisis ushers in greater protectionism , it could mean an end to an era of generosity and less concern for the welfare of others .
for the last decade it has been the very poor who have dominated the agenda of the world bank and the imf .
not any more .
in the last two months , it has been iceland , hungary , ukraine and pakistan knocking at the imf door .
already the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has sounded the alarm that his ambitious un millennium goals to slash poverty , illiteracy and disease run the risk of being neglected .
this could ' threaten to undermine all our achievements ' he said recently .
just this week the world food programme warned it was having to cut food aid to impoverished zimbabweans due to a lack of international donations .
a harbinger of things to come , perhaps .
and there is a broader implication - that it may become increasingly difficult to persuade nations to sign up for large-scale interventions to help the desperate and the victimised .
if a global recession can not be avoided , the united nations ' much vaunted " responsibility to protect " , only recently enacted , may end up already becoming an outdated aspiration .
you can listen to the bbc world service 's the forum with bridget kendall here .
your comments : the crisis will have low or any impact on international relations .
the governments have to stop pushing money into the banking system immediately and use it to support companies -lrb- not financial -rrb- and create new workplaces ervin , brno , czech republic subsidies will end for the developed world .
developing countries produce will be marketable in those developed countries .
the farmers in developed countries will be discouraged and will shunt farming due to poor returns .
developing countries , especially african economies will prosper .
developed countries ' exports will diminish in sales volumes to developing countries .
availability of cheap raw materials for the bug economies will decrease .

the europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency .
the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
but a rift has opened up between those like the french president , nicolas sarkozy , who seek permanent global oversight of financial transactions , and wary anglo-saxon governments - including above all the us administration - which fear that too much control could hamper the workings of the free market .
and even if that hurdle is surmounted , could any us president , even one enjoying such goodwill as president-elect barack obama , win congressional backing for a toothy regulatory body that would have real oversight of us institutions ?
whether the issue is international crimes against humanity or attempts to regulate carbon emissions , the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
russian president medvedev blames american policies for the current crisis meanwhile , the powerhouse nations of the so-called bric group - brazil , russia , india and china - and the petro-states of the gulf -lrb- armed with the bargaining chip of sovereign wealth funds -rrb- have made it clear that what they want is recognition that the old elite clubs dominated by western nations no longer reflect reality .
logic would suggest this means reform of the top tables not just at the imf and the world bank , but an enlargement of the g8 -lrb- group of eight most industrialised countries -rrb- , and the united nations security council .
fine in theory .
but in practice reforming the g8 is probably easiest .
already the annual summit opens its doors to other players .
and the 2009 host , italy 's silvio berlusconi , has made it known he intends to invite the g20 countries to his g8 sardinia party .
but the weary process of reform at the un has left many jaundiced .
it is hard to imagine the mechanism which would require current global powers to agree to anything but a symbolic change .
the bretton woods agreements agreed in july 1944 , but not all of them operative until 1959 creation of the imf and ibrd -lrb- now part of world bank -rrb- encouraged open markets obligation to maintain currency exchange rates within fixed values -lrb- to + / - 1 % -rrb- likewise at the world bank and the imf , the hard bargaining will revolve not just around which new countries get seats on the board , but whether they will be allowed to upset the current balance of power when it comes to decision-making .
note that already there are voices warning that too many players will make any new arrangement dysfunctional .
there are other complications .
russia continues to agitate for any adjustment that will lessen us influence , whether in financial or european security matters .
no doubt president medvedev will want to repeat his and mr putin 's belief that the root cause of the current financial crisis lies in american unilateralism following the end of the cold war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks - an ideological argument that may irritate rather than persuade and make consensus even harder to achieve .
safety in numbers and a third area of examination - what do the emergency reactions to the financial crisis so far tell us about the way the world may be heading ?
reactions seem to boil down to a choice of two - whether to conclude that in times of trouble safety lies in numbers and it is better to be part of a bigger bloc , or whether when the going gets hard , it is better to look after your own - the protectionist , nationalist instinct .
certainly some people seem to be concluding that size is the best security against future risk .
in beleaguered iceland , where six months ago opinion suggested a majority were against eu membership , those in favour of throwing their lot in with the eu has crept above 50 % .
a similar trend in scandinavia is leading the governments in denmark and possibly sweden to wonder if they should think again about offering a referendum on joining the euro .
in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
and in scotland , too , recent polls have suggested support for the scottish nationalist party 's vision of independence has lost ground .
going it alone , it seems , no longer looks so attractive in the wake of a financial crisis .
but at the same time , eu cohesiveness has taken a knocking .
despite early declarations of eu economic solidarity , it did n't take long for ireland to break ranks and offer a unilateral guarantee to depositors to forestall a run on its banks , or for germany to hint it would take similar action .
and disorderly eu bickering ahead of the washington summit has rather belied claims of european unity .
and in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
fears for poor for all the high hopes of turning this crisis to advantage , to push through reforms that otherwise would never have been contemplated , there is a danger it could pivot in the opposite direction .
and if this crisis ushers in greater protectionism , it could mean an end to an era of generosity and less concern for the welfare of others .
for the last decade it has been the very poor who have dominated the agenda of the world bank and the imf .
not any more .
in the last two months , it has been iceland , hungary , ukraine and pakistan knocking at the imf door .
already the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has sounded the alarm that his ambitious un millennium goals to slash poverty , illiteracy and disease run the risk of being neglected .
this could ' threaten to undermine all our achievements ' he said recently .
just this week the world food programme warned it was having to cut food aid to impoverished zimbabweans due to a lack of international donations .
a harbinger of things to come , perhaps .
and there is a broader implication - that it may become increasingly difficult to persuade nations to sign up for large-scale interventions to help the desperate and the victimised .
if a global recession can not be avoided , the united nations ' much vaunted " responsibility to protect " , only recently enacted , may end up already becoming an outdated aspiration .
you can listen to the bbc world service 's the forum with bridget kendall here .
your comments : the crisis will have low or any impact on international relations .
the governments have to stop pushing money into the banking system immediately and use it to support companies -lrb- not financial -rrb- and create new workplaces ervin , brno , czech republic subsidies will end for the developed world .
developing countries produce will be marketable in those developed countries .
the farmers in developed countries will be discouraged and will shunt farming due to poor returns .
developing countries , especially african economies will prosper .
developed countries ' exports will diminish in sales volumes to developing countries .
availability of cheap raw materials for the bug economies will decrease .
elphas moni , kampala , uganda i have been having a feeling lately that the current financial crisis is just another one off event and the situation will normalise soon .
the countries bickering about the us influence seem to be taking advantage of its current financial failings-which is a rather ill fated short term proposition .
more emphasis should be concentrated on what led to the current situation , .i.e. lavish credit from banks , ' cooked books ' from financial institutions etc ...
the chinese , though not there yet , have shown that we can regulate capitalism to the good of everyone .
but all in all the financial crisis is over hyped and it will therefore have negligible effect on the balance of power .
charles lukwago , kampala , uganda this is regarding a new multipolar world order chetan singh , dehradun , india let 's hope this trend signals the end of the dominance of the illuminati in europe and the us !
maurice , paris , france the financial crisis will affect international relations positively .
as the famous saying goes , adversity is a blessing in disguise .
the great financial crisis is serving as an eye opener to those who assumed that without investing in sustainable growth pre-requisites , profits can be harnessed forever .
they are being proved wrong .
madan gopal sharma , olten , switzerland your article is very interesting , focusing on the materialistic aspects of life -lrb- money , power , control etc -rrb- but it leaves out the more important aspect of humanity , its spiritual reality -lrb- compassion , justice , ethic , respect , truthfulness and many more . -rrb- .
there definitely needs to be a balance between the material and spiritual , otherwise civilisation as we are experiencing it in these days , will be doomed ... as happened to great civilisations of past ages .
paula van den boogaart , nuernberg , germany i would like to see more g-20 than g-7 , or 8 's .
also , more countries involved in the decisions of the planet , after all we are in this together .
the less government involvement in a free market , the better off the free market is , take the pain .
david eaton , las vegas , usa i think that balance of powers will tend to eastern nations but it is a matter of time -lrb- we do not know how many time -rrb- that that balance tends back to western nations again .
i think all nations should work together without thinking about particular interests like the usa and china , that consume lots of fossil fuel .
rising nations like brazil and india must be considered in all these international discussions about the economy etc .
gustavo pontello , araraquara , brazil the financial crisis has shaken many countries in the last few weeks , it has opened the eyes of the world on how the financial system was structured over the last 50 years .
the fall of the us economy and its domino effect on the rest of the world has proven one thing : the system was created to basically support them .
now , the leaders of the world 's biggest economy should learn to define the meaning of " balance " in this world .
they must set clear parameters to define how we can all affect each other .
mark carbungco , jakarta , indonesia clearly there can not be economic cooperation while politically there is so much sparring going on .
the most basic and essential step is for the us to stop entertaining this ridiculous idea that it is some kind of global superpower which has to control the world .
accordingly , obama 's first task is to unwind all the lunatic strategies bush embarked on - starting with abandoning plans to install missile shields in poland -lrb- clearly a breach of the non-proliferation pact and sure to restart cold war activities -rrb- .
russia should and would respond by toning down their own military enhancements .
this will help improve economic cooperation and free up some funds for more constructive purposes .
peter , townsville , australia i think the world blames the financial collapse on the u.s. , and for good reason .
we sold out our industrial base and the only thing we have left to export is debt .
now we are broke with no hope of recovery because we no longer produce or save .
an economy based on debt and consumption is unsustainable .
the " free trade " and globalist movement has been the biggest rip-off in world history , and the u.s. will default on the behemoth debt owed to china , russia , and the arabs .
the only ones benefitting from this whole mess are the criminal banker-elites who are looting our treasury for " bailouts " .
the american people are not blameless , however .
we lived beyond our means and allowed our governing officials to run wild with their corporate partners in crime .
after all , we were too busy with soccer games and trips to the mall to mind the " for the people , by the people " store .
america will be reduced to 3rd-world ashes by 2012 without a single shot ever needing to be fired .
ann minch , red bluff , ca -lrb- usa -rrb- great article except for the absence of any reference to japan .
this is strange on 3 counts .
first , it is the second biggest economy in the world-how can you possibly discuss the global economy without reference to it ?
second , to support your argument i would have thought japan's own rise post ww2 already suggested the movement away from west towards east long before china .
third , given japan's own financial sector woes in 1990 i thought this would be a good moot point for global discussion as to solving current crisis .
nicholas cunningham , australia what should governments of developed countries do ? 1 .
acknowledge that macroeconomic frameworks can be sustained only on strong foundations of microeconomic efficiencies .
the genesis of the present crisis is that financial superstructure has moved too far away from the real sectors of the economy .
2 .
set good examples of fiscal prudence ; current expenditures must be contained within current revenues ; only capital expenditures should be used to inflate or deflate the economy .
3 .
realise that " trickle down " strategies have failed miserably ; must work out stimulus packages that will work bottom up .
for a start , each of the citizens should be given a ' basic grant ' fixed at half the poverty level .
sastry kambhampati , hyderabad , india re : world food programme and zimbabwe - does this seem feasible : instead of shipping food -lrb- and money -rrb- from the west to feed impoverished zimbabweans , to actually have the un set up large scale farming on land garnered from the white farmers ?
the land remains zimbabwean and in time the management of these farms can revert to the locals .
martin peros , toronto , canada we like it or not capitalism and free-enterprise is the only successful economic system we have and free world trade is the only vehicle to achieve universal wealth .
the system is obviously not perfect but the best we 've got and the result of centuries of trial and error socio-economic evolution not the creation of any human mind .
our economy is far too complex and changing for any human mind or minds to embrace it , much less to predict and control it .
one more proof of this is watching the spectacle of world bureaucrats trying desperately to stop the crisis with little or no results .
nobody knows the solutions because nobody can understand the complexities of the rapidly evolving economic reality .
lucas antuna , san pedro , paraguay i think we need to head towards ' total socialism ' for all countries - what we extract from the grounds of poor nations should go mainly to their wealth , health and happiness and not to shareholders - hospitals and infrastructure should be all ' state owned ' and non profiting - all land should be state owned and state controlled and leased and never used as an asset or passed on to relatives .

by bridget kendall bbc diplomatic correspondent a deep-seated global crisis is often a chance to redraw the map , reflecting shifts in the balance of power in different ways .
first , the crisis can confirm or nudge ahead trends which seem to be happening anyway - like the shift of power from western to emerging eastern players .
second , it can put flesh on reforms already in the air - like plans to overhaul the international financial architecture to be discussed at this weekend 's summit being hosted by president bush in washington .
china is the latest large economy to announce an economic stimulus plan and third , there are the instinctive emergency reactions , supposedly temporary , but which can end up reshaping the global chessboard for years to come - the hurried nationalisation of some western banks , for instance , or possibly iceland 's desperate bailout appeal to russia - a nato member putting financial survival ahead of any security provisos .
of course to draw firm conclusions at this point , with the economic crisis far from over , is a risky venture .
but some patterns merit closer examination .
first , is the balance of power in the world really shifting eastwards ?
it is a question that has been the subject of much debate recently on the discussion programme the forum which i host for the bbc world service .
my guests ' general conclusion seems to be that , yes , asia is on the rise , and the economic woes of the us and europe have exposed the fragility of western banking and the vulnerability of western economies .
china and india have been less affected .
and , even if demand for chinese goods slows , its mammoth economy can still be a powerful engine of growth and a much needed source of liquidity .
russian nerves and yet , in a world so interdependent economically , can any part be immune ?
especially given the symbiotic relationship between china and the united states - " chimerica " as the harvard historian niall ferguson calls it : not two financial systems , but one .
economists including jm keynes negotiate the bretton woods agreements in these terms , surely if the american and other western economies have succumbed to a chronic bout of sneezing , flu for china and rest of world is inescapable ?
moreover , perhaps we should not overstate the resilience of emerging economies .
look no further than moscow , where the stock market panic and flight of capital abroad have been dramatic , and the fall in world oil prices has added to the economy 's battering .
despite russia 's legendary energy wealth , there is a new nervous uncertainty among local businessmen who - one suspects - know more than most about the way the domestic economy remains weakened by corruption and a labyrinthine smoke-and-mirrors way of doing business .
a second question worth pondering - just how likely is it that this weekend 's top-level meeting really will generate reform of the world 's leading financial institutions ?
bridget kendall 1998 to present : bbc diplomatic correspondent 1994-98 : washington correspondent 1989-94 : moscow correspondent more about bridget there is grand talk of a ' bretton woods two ' , a vision for a new financial system pushed for some time by , among others , britain 's gordon brown .
true , there is broad agreement on an agenda to seek ways to forestall a global recession , devise an early warning system and consider more international regulation .
but the leaders from 20 of the world 's largest economies bring to the table a variety of conflicting interests , some motivated by practical need , others by ideological considerations , some looking for short term fixes - the move from private to state control of banks for instance - which others view as a desirable long term objective .
top table reform so is major reform feasible ?
is the current economic crisis cataclysmic enough yet to be truly transformational ?
the europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency .
the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .

by bridget kendall bbc diplomatic correspondent a deep-seated global crisis is often a chance to redraw the map , reflecting shifts in the balance of power in different ways .
first , the crisis can confirm or nudge ahead trends which seem to be happening anyway - like the shift of power from western to emerging eastern players .
second , it can put flesh on reforms already in the air - like plans to overhaul the international financial architecture to be discussed at this weekend 's summit being hosted by president bush in washington .
china is the latest large economy to announce an economic stimulus plan and third , there are the instinctive emergency reactions , supposedly temporary , but which can end up reshaping the global chessboard for years to come - the hurried nationalisation of some western banks , for instance , or possibly iceland 's desperate bailout appeal to russia - a nato member putting financial survival ahead of any security provisos .
of course to draw firm conclusions at this point , with the economic crisis far from over , is a risky venture .
but some patterns merit closer examination .
first , is the balance of power in the world really shifting eastwards ?
it is a question that has been the subject of much debate recently on the discussion programme the forum which i host for the bbc world service .
my guests ' general conclusion seems to be that , yes , asia is on the rise , and the economic woes of the us and europe have exposed the fragility of western banking and the vulnerability of western economies .
china and india have been less affected .
and , even if demand for chinese goods slows , its mammoth economy can still be a powerful engine of growth and a much needed source of liquidity .
russian nerves and yet , in a world so interdependent economically , can any part be immune ?
especially given the symbiotic relationship between china and the united states - " chimerica " as the harvard historian niall ferguson calls it : not two financial systems , but one .
economists including jm keynes negotiate the bretton woods agreements in these terms , surely if the american and other western economies have succumbed to a chronic bout of sneezing , flu for china and rest of world is inescapable ?
moreover , perhaps we should not overstate the resilience of emerging economies .
look no further than moscow , where the stock market panic and flight of capital abroad have been dramatic , and the fall in world oil prices has added to the economy 's battering .
despite russia 's legendary energy wealth , there is a new nervous uncertainty among local businessmen who - one suspects - know more than most about the way the domestic economy remains weakened by corruption and a labyrinthine smoke-and-mirrors way of doing business .
a second question worth pondering - just how likely is it that this weekend 's top-level meeting really will generate reform of the world 's leading financial institutions ?
bridget kendall 1998 to present : bbc diplomatic correspondent 1994-98 : washington correspondent 1989-94 : moscow correspondent more about bridget there is grand talk of a ' bretton woods two ' , a vision for a new financial system pushed for some time by , among others , britain 's gordon brown .
true , there is broad agreement on an agenda to seek ways to forestall a global recession , devise an early warning system and consider more international regulation .
but the leaders from 20 of the world 's largest economies bring to the table a variety of conflicting interests , some motivated by practical need , others by ideological considerations , some looking for short term fixes - the move from private to state control of banks for instance - which others view as a desirable long term objective .
top table reform so is major reform feasible ?
is the current economic crisis cataclysmic enough yet to be truly transformational ?
the europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency .
the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
but a rift has opened up between those like the french president , nicolas sarkozy , who seek permanent global oversight of financial transactions , and wary anglo-saxon governments - including above all the us administration - which fear that too much control could hamper the workings of the free market .
and even if that hurdle is surmounted , could any us president , even one enjoying such goodwill as president-elect barack obama , win congressional backing for a toothy regulatory body that would have real oversight of us institutions ?
whether the issue is international crimes against humanity or attempts to regulate carbon emissions , the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
russian president medvedev blames american policies for the current crisis meanwhile , the powerhouse nations of the so-called bric group - brazil , russia , india and china - and the petro-states of the gulf -lrb- armed with the bargaining chip of sovereign wealth funds -rrb- have made it clear that what they want is recognition that the old elite clubs dominated by western nations no longer reflect reality .
logic would suggest this means reform of the top tables not just at the imf and the world bank , but an enlargement of the g8 -lrb- group of eight most industrialised countries -rrb- , and the united nations security council .
fine in theory .
but in practice reforming the g8 is probably easiest .
already the annual summit opens its doors to other players .
and the 2009 host , italy 's silvio berlusconi , has made it known he intends to invite the g20 countries to his g8 sardinia party .
but the weary process of reform at the un has left many jaundiced .
it is hard to imagine the mechanism which would require current global powers to agree to anything but a symbolic change .
the bretton woods agreements agreed in july 1944 , but not all of them operative until 1959 creation of the imf and ibrd -lrb- now part of world bank -rrb- encouraged open markets obligation to maintain currency exchange rates within fixed values -lrb- to + / - 1 % -rrb- likewise at the world bank and the imf , the hard bargaining will revolve not just around which new countries get seats on the board , but whether they will be allowed to upset the current balance of power when it comes to decision-making .
note that already there are voices warning that too many players will make any new arrangement dysfunctional .
there are other complications .
russia continues to agitate for any adjustment that will lessen us influence , whether in financial or european security matters .
no doubt president medvedev will want to repeat his and mr putin 's belief that the root cause of the current financial crisis lies in american unilateralism following the end of the cold war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks - an ideological argument that may irritate rather than persuade and make consensus even harder to achieve .
safety in numbers and a third area of examination - what do the emergency reactions to the financial crisis so far tell us about the way the world may be heading ?
reactions seem to boil down to a choice of two - whether to conclude that in times of trouble safety lies in numbers and it is better to be part of a bigger bloc , or whether when the going gets hard , it is better to look after your own - the protectionist , nationalist instinct .
certainly some people seem to be concluding that size is the best security against future risk .
in beleaguered iceland , where six months ago opinion suggested a majority were against eu membership , those in favour of throwing their lot in with the eu has crept above 50 % .
a similar trend in scandinavia is leading the governments in denmark and possibly sweden to wonder if they should think again about offering a referendum on joining the euro .
in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
and in scotland , too , recent polls have suggested support for the scottish nationalist party 's vision of independence has lost ground .
going it alone , it seems , no longer looks so attractive in the wake of a financial crisis .
but at the same time , eu cohesiveness has taken a knocking .
despite early declarations of eu economic solidarity , it did n't take long for ireland to break ranks and offer a unilateral guarantee to depositors to forestall a run on its banks , or for germany to hint it would take similar action .
and disorderly eu bickering ahead of the washington summit has rather belied claims of european unity .
and in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
fears for poor for all the high hopes of turning this crisis to advantage , to push through reforms that otherwise would never have been contemplated , there is a danger it could pivot in the opposite direction .
and if this crisis ushers in greater protectionism , it could mean an end to an era of generosity and less concern for the welfare of others .
for the last decade it has been the very poor who have dominated the agenda of the world bank and the imf .
not any more .
in the last two months , it has been iceland , hungary , ukraine and pakistan knocking at the imf door .
already the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has sounded the alarm that his ambitious un millennium goals to slash poverty , illiteracy and disease run the risk of being neglected .
this could ' threaten to undermine all our achievements ' he said recently .
just this week the world food programme warned it was having to cut food aid to impoverished zimbabweans due to a lack of international donations .
a harbinger of things to come , perhaps .
and there is a broader implication - that it may become increasingly difficult to persuade nations to sign up for large-scale interventions to help the desperate and the victimised .
if a global recession can not be avoided , the united nations ' much vaunted " responsibility to protect " , only recently enacted , may end up already becoming an outdated aspiration .
you can listen to the bbc world service 's the forum with bridget kendall here .
your comments : the crisis will have low or any impact on international relations .
the governments have to stop pushing money into the banking system immediately and use it to support companies -lrb- not financial -rrb- and create new workplaces ervin , brno , czech republic subsidies will end for the developed world .
developing countries produce will be marketable in those developed countries .
the farmers in developed countries will be discouraged and will shunt farming due to poor returns .
developing countries , especially african economies will prosper .
developed countries ' exports will diminish in sales volumes to developing countries .
availability of cheap raw materials for the bug economies will decrease .
elphas moni , kampala , uganda i have been having a feeling lately that the current financial crisis is just another one off event and the situation will normalise soon .
the countries bickering about the us influence seem to be taking advantage of its current financial failings-which is a rather ill fated short term proposition .
more emphasis should be concentrated on what led to the current situation , .i.e. lavish credit from banks , ' cooked books ' from financial institutions etc ...
the chinese , though not there yet , have shown that we can regulate capitalism to the good of everyone .
but all in all the financial crisis is over hyped and it will therefore have negligible effect on the balance of power .
charles lukwago , kampala , uganda this is regarding a new multipolar world order chetan singh , dehradun , india let 's hope this trend signals the end of the dominance of the illuminati in europe and the us !
maurice , paris , france the financial crisis will affect international relations positively .
as the famous saying goes , adversity is a blessing in disguise .
the great financial crisis is serving as an eye opener to those who assumed that without investing in sustainable growth pre-requisites , profits can be harnessed forever .
they are being proved wrong .
madan gopal sharma , olten , switzerland your article is very interesting , focusing on the materialistic aspects of life -lrb- money , power , control etc -rrb- but it leaves out the more important aspect of humanity , its spiritual reality -lrb- compassion , justice , ethic , respect , truthfulness and many more . -rrb- .
there definitely needs to be a balance between the material and spiritual , otherwise civilisation as we are experiencing it in these days , will be doomed ... as happened to great civilisations of past ages .
paula van den boogaart , nuernberg , germany i would like to see more g-20 than g-7 , or 8 's .
also , more countries involved in the decisions of the planet , after all we are in this together .
the less government involvement in a free market , the better off the free market is , take the pain .
david eaton , las vegas , usa i think that balance of powers will tend to eastern nations but it is a matter of time -lrb- we do not know how many time -rrb- that that balance tends back to western nations again .
i think all nations should work together without thinking about particular interests like the usa and china , that consume lots of fossil fuel .
rising nations like brazil and india must be considered in all these international discussions about the economy etc .
gustavo pontello , araraquara , brazil the financial crisis has shaken many countries in the last few weeks , it has opened the eyes of the world on how the financial system was structured over the last 50 years .
the fall of the us economy and its domino effect on the rest of the world has proven one thing : the system was created to basically support them .
now , the leaders of the world 's biggest economy should learn to define the meaning of " balance " in this world .
they must set clear parameters to define how we can all affect each other .
mark carbungco , jakarta , indonesia clearly there can not be economic cooperation while politically there is so much sparring going on .
the most basic and essential step is for the us to stop entertaining this ridiculous idea that it is some kind of global superpower which has to control the world .
accordingly , obama 's first task is to unwind all the lunatic strategies bush embarked on - starting with abandoning plans to install missile shields in poland -lrb- clearly a breach of the non-proliferation pact and sure to restart cold war activities -rrb- .
russia should and would respond by toning down their own military enhancements .
this will help improve economic cooperation and free up some funds for more constructive purposes .
peter , townsville , australia i think the world blames the financial collapse on the u.s. , and for good reason .
we sold out our industrial base and the only thing we have left to export is debt .
now we are broke with no hope of recovery because we no longer produce or save .
an economy based on debt and consumption is unsustainable .
the " free trade " and globalist movement has been the biggest rip-off in world history , and the u.s. will default on the behemoth debt owed to china , russia , and the arabs .
the only ones benefitting from this whole mess are the criminal banker-elites who are looting our treasury for " bailouts " .
the american people are not blameless , however .
we lived beyond our means and allowed our governing officials to run wild with their corporate partners in crime .
after all , we were too busy with soccer games and trips to the mall to mind the " for the people , by the people " store .
america will be reduced to 3rd-world ashes by 2012 without a single shot ever needing to be fired .
ann minch , red bluff , ca -lrb- usa -rrb- great article except for the absence of any reference to japan .
this is strange on 3 counts .
first , it is the second biggest economy in the world-how can you possibly discuss the global economy without reference to it ?
second , to support your argument i would have thought japan's own rise post ww2 already suggested the movement away from west towards east long before china .
third , given japan's own financial sector woes in 1990 i thought this would be a good moot point for global discussion as to solving current crisis .
nicholas cunningham , australia what should governments of developed countries do ? 1 .
acknowledge that macroeconomic frameworks can be sustained only on strong foundations of microeconomic efficiencies .
the genesis of the present crisis is that financial superstructure has moved too far away from the real sectors of the economy .
2 .
set good examples of fiscal prudence ; current expenditures must be contained within current revenues ; only capital expenditures should be used to inflate or deflate the economy .
3 .
realise that " trickle down " strategies have failed miserably ; must work out stimulus packages that will work bottom up .
for a start , each of the citizens should be given a ' basic grant ' fixed at half the poverty level .
sastry kambhampati , hyderabad , india re : world food programme and zimbabwe - does this seem feasible : instead of shipping food -lrb- and money -rrb- from the west to feed impoverished zimbabweans , to actually have the un set up large scale farming on land garnered from the white farmers ?
the land remains zimbabwean and in time the management of these farms can revert to the locals .
martin peros , toronto , canada we like it or not capitalism and free-enterprise is the only successful economic system we have and free world trade is the only vehicle to achieve universal wealth .
the system is obviously not perfect but the best we 've got and the result of centuries of trial and error socio-economic evolution not the creation of any human mind .
our economy is far too complex and changing for any human mind or minds to embrace it , much less to predict and control it .
one more proof of this is watching the spectacle of world bureaucrats trying desperately to stop the crisis with little or no results .
nobody knows the solutions because nobody can understand the complexities of the rapidly evolving economic reality .
lucas antuna , san pedro , paraguay i think we need to head towards ' total socialism ' for all countries - what we extract from the grounds of poor nations should go mainly to their wealth , health and happiness and not to shareholders - hospitals and infrastructure should be all ' state owned ' and non profiting - all land should be state owned and state controlled and leased and never used as an asset or passed on to relatives .

madan gopal sharma , olten , switzerland your article is very interesting , focusing on the materialistic aspects of life -lrb- money , power , control etc -rrb- but it leaves out the more important aspect of humanity , its spiritual reality -lrb- compassion , justice , ethic , respect , truthfulness and many more . -rrb- .
there definitely needs to be a balance between the material and spiritual , otherwise civilisation as we are experiencing it in these days , will be doomed ... as happened to great civilisations of past ages .
paula van den boogaart , nuernberg , germany i would like to see more g-20 than g-7 , or 8 's .
also , more countries involved in the decisions of the planet , after all we are in this together .
the less government involvement in a free market , the better off the free market is , take the pain .
david eaton , las vegas , usa i think that balance of powers will tend to eastern nations but it is a matter of time -lrb- we do not know how many time -rrb- that that balance tends back to western nations again .
i think all nations should work together without thinking about particular interests like the usa and china , that consume lots of fossil fuel .
rising nations like brazil and india must be considered in all these international discussions about the economy etc .
gustavo pontello , araraquara , brazil the financial crisis has shaken many countries in the last few weeks , it has opened the eyes of the world on how the financial system was structured over the last 50 years .
the fall of the us economy and its domino effect on the rest of the world has proven one thing : the system was created to basically support them .
now , the leaders of the world 's biggest economy should learn to define the meaning of " balance " in this world .
they must set clear parameters to define how we can all affect each other .
mark carbungco , jakarta , indonesia clearly there can not be economic cooperation while politically there is so much sparring going on .
the most basic and essential step is for the us to stop entertaining this ridiculous idea that it is some kind of global superpower which has to control the world .
accordingly , obama 's first task is to unwind all the lunatic strategies bush embarked on - starting with abandoning plans to install missile shields in poland -lrb- clearly a breach of the non-proliferation pact and sure to restart cold war activities -rrb- .
russia should and would respond by toning down their own military enhancements .
this will help improve economic cooperation and free up some funds for more constructive purposes .
peter , townsville , australia i think the world blames the financial collapse on the u.s. , and for good reason .
we sold out our industrial base and the only thing we have left to export is debt .
now we are broke with no hope of recovery because we no longer produce or save .
an economy based on debt and consumption is unsustainable .
the " free trade " and globalist movement has been the biggest rip-off in world history , and the u.s. will default on the behemoth debt owed to china , russia , and the arabs .
the only ones benefitting from this whole mess are the criminal banker-elites who are looting our treasury for " bailouts " .
the american people are not blameless , however .
we lived beyond our means and allowed our governing officials to run wild with their corporate partners in crime .
after all , we were too busy with soccer games and trips to the mall to mind the " for the people , by the people " store .
america will be reduced to 3rd-world ashes by 2012 without a single shot ever needing to be fired .
ann minch , red bluff , ca -lrb- usa -rrb- great article except for the absence of any reference to japan .
this is strange on 3 counts .
first , it is the second biggest economy in the world-how can you possibly discuss the global economy without reference to it ?
second , to support your argument i would have thought japan's own rise post ww2 already suggested the movement away from west towards east long before china .
third , given japan's own financial sector woes in 1990 i thought this would be a good moot point for global discussion as to solving current crisis .
nicholas cunningham , australia what should governments of developed countries do ? 1 .
acknowledge that macroeconomic frameworks can be sustained only on strong foundations of microeconomic efficiencies .
the genesis of the present crisis is that financial superstructure has moved too far away from the real sectors of the economy .
2 .
set good examples of fiscal prudence ; current expenditures must be contained within current revenues ; only capital expenditures should be used to inflate or deflate the economy .
3 .
realise that " trickle down " strategies have failed miserably ; must work out stimulus packages that will work bottom up .
for a start , each of the citizens should be given a ' basic grant ' fixed at half the poverty level .
sastry kambhampati , hyderabad , india re : world food programme and zimbabwe - does this seem feasible : instead of shipping food -lrb- and money -rrb- from the west to feed impoverished zimbabweans , to actually have the un set up large scale farming on land garnered from the white farmers ?
the land remains zimbabwean and in time the management of these farms can revert to the locals .
martin peros , toronto , canada we like it or not capitalism and free-enterprise is the only successful economic system we have and free world trade is the only vehicle to achieve universal wealth .
the system is obviously not perfect but the best we 've got and the result of centuries of trial and error socio-economic evolution not the creation of any human mind .
our economy is far too complex and changing for any human mind or minds to embrace it , much less to predict and control it .
one more proof of this is watching the spectacle of world bureaucrats trying desperately to stop the crisis with little or no results .
nobody knows the solutions because nobody can understand the complexities of the rapidly evolving economic reality .
lucas antuna , san pedro , paraguay i think we need to head towards ' total socialism ' for all countries - what we extract from the grounds of poor nations should go mainly to their wealth , health and happiness and not to shareholders - hospitals and infrastructure should be all ' state owned ' and non profiting - all land should be state owned and state controlled and leased and never used as an asset or passed on to relatives .

by bridget kendall bbc diplomatic correspondent a deep-seated global crisis is often a chance to redraw the map , reflecting shifts in the balance of power in different ways .
first , the crisis can confirm or nudge ahead trends which seem to be happening anyway - like the shift of power from western to emerging eastern players .
second , it can put flesh on reforms already in the air - like plans to overhaul the international financial architecture to be discussed at this weekend 's summit being hosted by president bush in washington .
and third , there are the instinctive emergency reactions , supposedly temporary , but which can end up reshaping the global chessboard for years to come - the hurried nationalisation of some western banks , for instance , or possibly iceland 's desperate bailout appeal to russia - a nato member putting financial survival ahead of any security provisos .
of course to draw firm conclusions at this point , with the economic crisis far from over , is a risky venture .
but some patterns merit closer examination .
first , is the balance of power in the world really shifting eastwards ?
it is a question that has been the subject of much debate recently on the discussion programme the forum which i host for the bbc world service .
my guests ' general conclusion seems to be that , yes , asia is on the rise , and the economic woes of the us and europe have exposed the fragility of western banking and the vulnerability of western economies .
china and india have been less affected .
and , even if demand for chinese goods slows , its mammoth economy can still be a powerful engine of growth and a much needed source of liquidity .
russian nerves and yet , in a world so interdependent economically , can any part be immune ?
especially given the symbiotic relationship between china and the united states - " chimerica " as the harvard historian niall ferguson calls it : not two financial systems , but one .
in these terms , surely if the american and other western economies have succumbed to a chronic bout of sneezing , flu for china and rest of world is inescapable ?
moreover , perhaps we should not overstate the resilience of emerging economies .
look no further than moscow , where the stock market panic and flight of capital abroad have been dramatic , and the fall in world oil prices has added to the economy 's battering .
despite russia 's legendary energy wealth , there is a new nervous uncertainty among local businessmen who - one suspects - know more than most about the way the domestic economy remains weakened by corruption and a labyrinthine smoke-and-mirrors way of doing business .
a second question worth pondering - just how likely is it that this weekend 's top-level meeting really will generate reform of the world 's leading financial institutions ?
bridget kendall 1998 to present : bbc diplomatic correspondent 1994-98 : washington correspondent 1989-94 : moscow correspondent more about bridget there is grand talk of a ' bretton woods two ' , a vision for a new financial system pushed for some time by , among others , britain 's gordon brown .
true , there is broad agreement on an agenda to seek ways to forestall a global recession , devise an early warning system and consider more international regulation .
but the leaders from 20 of the world 's largest economies bring to the table a variety of conflicting interests , some motivated by practical need , others by ideological considerations , some looking for short term fixes - the move from private to state control of banks for instance - which others view as a desirable long term objective .
top table reform so is major reform feasible ?
is the current economic crisis cataclysmic enough yet to be truly transformational ?
the europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency . "
the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ? "
but a rift has opened up between those like the french president , nicolas sarkozy , who seek permanent global oversight of financial transactions , and wary anglo-saxon governments - including above all the us administration - which fear that too much control could hamper the workings of the free market .
and even if that hurdle is surmounted , could any us president , even one enjoying such goodwill as president-elect barack obama , win congressional backing for a toothy regulatory body that would have real oversight of us institutions ?
whether the issue is international crimes against humanity or attempts to regulate carbon emissions , the united states has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
why should this be any different ?
meanwhile , the powerhouse nations of the so-called bric group - brazil , russia , india and china - and the petro-states of the gulf -lrb- armed with the bargaining chip of sovereign wealth funds -rrb- have made it clear that what they want is recognition that the old elite clubs dominated by western nations no longer reflect reality .
logic would suggest this means reform of the top tables not just at the imf and the world bank , but an enlargement of the g8 -lrb- group of eight most industrialised countries -rrb- , and the united nations security council .
fine in theory .
but in practice reforming the g8 is probably easiest .
already the annual summit opens its doors to other players .
and the 2009 host , italy 's silvio berlusconi , has made it known he intends to invite the g20 countries to his g8 sardinia party .
but the weary process of reform at the un has left many jaundiced .
it is hard to imagine the mechanism which would require current global powers to agree to anything but a symbolic change .
the bretton woods agreements agreed in july 1944 , but not all of them operative until 1959 creation of the imf and ibrd -lrb- now part of world bank -rrb- encouraged open markets obligation to maintain currency exchange rates within fixed values -lrb- to + / - 1 % -rrb- likewise at the world bank and the imf , the hard bargaining will revolve not just around which new countries get seats on the board , but whether they will be allowed to upset the current balance of power when it comes to decision-making .
note that already there are voices warning that too many players will make any new arrangement dysfunctional .
there are other complications .
russia continues to agitate for any adjustment that will lessen us influence , whether in financial or european security matters .
no doubt president medvedev will want to repeat his and mr putin 's belief that the root cause of the current financial crisis lies in american unilateralism following the end of the cold war and the 9/11 terrorist attacks - an ideological argument that may irritate rather than persuade and make consensus even harder to achieve .
safety in numbers and a third area of examination - what do the emergency reactions to the financial crisis so far tell us about the way the world may be heading ?
reactions seem to boil down to a choice of two - whether to conclude that in times of trouble safety lies in numbers and it is better to be part of a bigger bloc , or whether when the going gets hard , it is better to look after your own - the protectionist , nationalist instinct .
certainly some people seem to be concluding that size is the best security against future risk .
in beleaguered iceland , where six months ago opinion suggested a majority were against eu membership , those in favour of throwing their lot in with the eu has crept above 50 % .
a similar trend in scandinavia is leading the governments in denmark and possibly sweden to wonder if they should think again about offering a referendum on joining the euro . "
in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ? "
and in scotland , too , recent polls have suggested support for the scottish nationalist party 's vision of independence has lost ground .
going it alone , it seems , no longer looks so attractive in the wake of a financial crisis .
but at the same time , eu cohesiveness has taken a knocking .
despite early declarations of eu economic solidarity , it did n't take long for ireland to break ranks and offer a unilateral guarantee to depositors to forestall a run on its banks , or for germany to hint it would take similar action .
and disorderly eu bickering ahead of the washington summit has rather belied claims of european unity .
and in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have-nots ?
fears for poor for all the high hopes of turning this crisis to advantage , to push through reforms that otherwise would never have been contemplated , there is a danger it could pivot in the opposite direction .
and if this crisis ushers in greater protectionism , it could mean an end to an era of generosity and less concern for the welfare of others .
for the last decade it has been the very poor who have dominated the agenda of the world bank and the imf .
not any more .
in the last two months , it has been iceland , hungary , ukraine and pakistan knocking at the imf door .
already the un secretary general , ban ki-moon , has sounded the alarm that his ambitious un millennium goals to slash poverty , illiteracy and disease run the risk of being neglected .
this could ' threaten to undermine all our achievements ' he said recently .
just this week the world food programme warned it was having to cut food aid to impoverished zimbabweans due to a lack of international donations .
a harbinger of things to come , perhaps .
and there is a broader implication - that it may become increasingly difficult to persuade nations to sign up for large-scale interventions to help the desperate and the victimised .
if a global recession can not be avoided , the united nations ' much vaunted " responsibility to protect " , only recently enacted , may end up already becoming an outdated aspiration .
you can listen to the bbc world service 's the forum with bridget kendall here .
your comments : the crisis will have low or any impact on international relations .
the governments have to stop pushing money into the banking system immediately and use it to support companies -lrb- not financial -rrb- and create new workplaces ervin , brno , czech republic subsidies will end for the developed world .
developing countries produce will be marketable in those developed countries .
the farmers in developed countries will be discouraged and will shunt farming due to poor returns .
developing countries , especially african economies will prosper .
developed countries ' exports will diminish in sales volumes to developing countries .
availability of cheap raw materials for the bug economies will decrease .
elphas moni , kampala , uganda i have been having a feeling lately that the current financial crisis is just another one off event and the situation will normalise soon .
the countries bickering about the us influence seem to be taking advantage of its current financial failings-which is a rather ill fated short term proposition .
more emphasis should be concentrated on what led to the current situation , .i.e. lavish credit from banks , ' cooked books ' from financial institutions etc ...
the chinese , though not there yet , have shown that we can regulate capitalism to the good of everyone .
but all in all the financial crisis is over hyped and it will therefore have negligible effect on the balance of power .
charles lukwago , kampala , uganda this is regarding a new multipolar world order chetan singh , dehradun , india let 's hope this trend signals the end of the dominance of the illuminati in europe and the us !
maurice , paris , france the financial crisis will affect international relations positively .
as the famous saying goes , adversity is a blessing in disguise .
the great financial crisis is serving as an eye opener to those who assumed that without investing in sustainable growth pre-requisites , profits can be harnessed forever .
they are being proved wrong .

almost 700,000 people commute via the 50 overground rail routes into london .
last month the national audit office said rail passengers in england and wales face more crowding and fare rises unless the network is expanded .
overground rail routes account for about a fifth of all commuting in london .
the london assembly investigation will focus on the passenger experience as well as mapping and analysis of how effectively overcrowding is currently being tackled .

across the world , exciting , alarming and momentous events have happened .
americans have elected a new president .
banks and stock markets have teetered on the brink of bankruptcy .
athletes at beijing shattered world records .
closer to home , the tyrone gaelic football team won the all-ireland final .
but at stormont , to paraphrase winston churchill , the integrity of the two major parties ' quarrel has remained unaltered .
what 's the standoff all about ?
well it all goes back to the talks at st andrews in scotland in 2006 .
sinn féin believed they had a deal that a local minister would take charge of policing and justice by may this year .
however , the dup insist they did n't sign anything .
in august it looked like there had been a breakthrough .
social development minister margaret ritchie has a full in tray both parties agreed they would n't take the justice job and that a future minister should be elected with cross community support .
but since then they 've been haggling over the details .
although the devolution of justice is the key issue , the stalemate has meant that other policy decisions have been shunted into the sidings .
there will be no movement on areas as diverse as the future of the maze jail and rural planning restrictions unless the deadlock is broken .
an irish language act was rejected by the former dup culture minister edwin poots .
perhaps progress on language rights in a more general sense will be possible if there 's a wider political deal .
so far there 's no sign of the government stepping in with any invitation to a fresh round of " hothouse talks " like the st andrews or leeds castle negotiations .
gentle poke instead the view in london is that the local politicians should stand on their own feet .
lurking in the background is the possibility of a collapse leading to a fresh election .
are republicans calculating that would be worse news for the dup than sinn féin ?
business , church and other community leaders have expressed their frustration .
every day the belfast telegraph publishes a reminder on its front page of how many days it 's been since the ministers sat around their table .
the telegraph 's news editor ronan henry describes it as a " gentle poke in the shoulder of the main parties " to remind them that , as the recession worsens , people are concerned nothing is happening up on the hill .
sdlp social development minister margaret ritchie describes her frustration at being told just hours or minutes before a scheduled executive that the meeting has been cancelled once again .
more important than the minister 's inconvenience , though , is the wider impact .
some decisions have been made through urgent written procedures , but ms ritchie still has papers on housing , alcohol licensing and fuel poverty sitting in her pending tray .
she says the fuel poverty package in particular would , if approved , make a real difference to vulnerable households this winter .
intensive talks between the dup and sinn féin have been under way inside stormont castle .
the details have been kept secret but this week the mood appears to have improved .
earlier this week , appearing on the bbc 's stormont live , the education minister caitríona ruane expressed her hope that ministers would meet before christmas .
the decision of peter robinson and martin mcguinness to brief a stormont committee on devolving policing and justice next week - albeit behind closed doors - has been interpreted as a positive sign .
dup members are expected to be briefed on the negotiations at a meeting on friday night .
one source told me they thought a deal was 85 % there .
however , hints of possible progress no longer seem sufficient .
it will require real movement if the damage done to the image of devolution over the past 21 weeks can begin to be restored .

welsh secretary paul murphy is believed to agree with mps on the welsh affairs select committee to restrict the power requested by the assembly government .
but it 's understood plaid cymru assembly government ministers are refusing to accept a narrower bid .
it is the latest stage of an increasingly heated row about powers .
mr morgan has told welsh secretary paul murphy , who has a veto over the process , that he accepts the bid for power is wider than originally intended or requested by the assembly government but did so without consulting his full cabinet , including coalition partners plaid cymru who hold the housing portfolio .
future governments plaid are pushing for the assembly government to demand the full set of powers to be devolved but the strong indications are that mr murphy intends to refuse this .
the assembly government wants the authority to suspend the right-to-buy option for council tenants , saying this will help with the supply of social housing stock .
but their bid for a legislative competence order - lco or welsh law - in this area included acquiring the power to go further and abolish the right-to-buy option .
it was drafted in a way that would enable future assembly governments to amend or even scrap the system in wales .
assembly ministers said they had no intention of abolishing the right to buy but mps on the welsh affairs select committee recommended the proposed lco should not be allowed to proceed unless the abolition power is removed .
' drafting error ' they said the assembly government should only get the powers they had requested to carry out the pledge in the one wales agreement which created the coalition between labour and plaid to temporarily suspend the right to buy in an area of extreme housing pressure .
they suggested that the bid for power would have led to the assembly government getting more power than it had intended to request .
the assembly government deny there is any drafting error .
the order has become a touchstone issue in the increasing tension between cardiff and westminster - the presiding officer of the assembly lord dafydd elis thomas , has accused the mps on the committee of " anti devolutionist tendencies " over their demand for the order to be redrafted .
while they do n't have the power to redraft the legislation , the welsh secretary paul murphy has the power of veto - unless he approves it , it can not go forward into parliament , become law , and see the powers in this area devolved to the assembly .
negotiations have been underway in recent weeks between the assembly government and mr murphy about whether the order should go forward .
the first minister 's been under significant pressure from plaid cymru as well as many of his own back benchers to stand firm on the wider order .
' stand-off ' it 's seen as a symbolic line in the sand in the lco process .
many are concerned at the precedent a narrowing at the behest of the mps might have for future orders - with a bid to devolve powers over the welsh language to the assembly still in the pipeline , and likely to provoke intense debate .
it had been expected that the situation could lead to a stand off between the welsh secretary and the assembly government , especially since the under secretary of state for wales wayne david gave a conference last week a strong hint that the wales office was minded to reject the bid for full powers .
a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said : " we do n't recognise this version of events .
constructive work and discussions are ongoing with regard to the suspension of the right-to-buy lco . "

south somerset climate action group believes acres of unused garden space in ilminster could be let out for vegetable cultivation .
the group is giving out free seeds to help growers to get started and produce would be shared between themselves and the householder .
the idea emerged because of a lack of allotments in the town .
spokesman joe burlington said : " it can be just a small patch , whatever is available .
" we thought , with people who have a patch of land they do n't want to spend the time working on and others are waiting for allotments , why not get the two together and see whether somebody could lend a patch of land and when there 's a little bit of produce , it gets shared ?
" but the ideal would be if there were more allotments . "
he said there would have to be negotiations between the individuals involved over access to gardens and how much produce each takes .

cheng wen-lung said his client had not eaten since being sent to tucheng jail in suburban taipei early on wednesday .
he said his client wanted to " protest the death of justice " .
mr chen , who has not yet been formally charged , says he is being persecuted by his successors for his fierce opposition to closer ties with beijing .
but that charge has been flatly denied by both the chinese government and by taiwan 's current president ma ying-jeou , of the nationalist kuomingtang party -lrb- kmt -rrb- .
mr chen has been a vocal and persistent critic of the kmt 's china policies since he left office in may at the end of eight years in the presidency .
' sovereignty ' mr chen 's supporters have promised further demonstrations mr chen was dramatically handcuffed and detained by prosecutors on tuesday and sent to jail early on wednesday , since when he has not eaten , mr cheng said .
he wants to " protest the death of justice and the regression of democracy " , mr cheng said , according to the ap news agency .
" he opposed the authoritarian -lsb- nationalist -rsb- regime in taiwan and the communist regime -lsb- in china -rsb- and he wants sovereignty for taiwan , " mr cheng added .
he added that his client was in an " ok " condition for the time being .
mr chen could face up to four months in detention without charge to prevent him colluding with alleged conspirators .
he is accused of money laundering and illegally using a special presidential fund .
but his supporters say his detention represents a breach to his human rights .
some say they plan to protest on saturday outside the jail in which he is being held .

cheng wen-lung said his client had not eaten since being sent to tucheng jail in suburban taipei early on wednesday .
he said his client wanted to " protest the death of justice " .
mr chen , who has not yet been formally charged , says he is being persecuted by his successors for his fierce opposition to closer ties with beijing .
but that charge has been flatly denied by both the chinese government and by taiwan 's current president ma ying-jeou , of the nationalist kuomingtang party -lrb- kmt -rrb- .
mr chen has been a vocal and persistent critic of the kmt 's china policies since he left office in may at the end of eight years in the presidency .
' sovereignty ' mr chen 's supporters have promised further demonstrations mr chen was dramatically handcuffed and detained by prosecutors on tuesday and sent to jail early on wednesday , since when he has not eaten , mr cheng said .
he wants to " protest the death of justice and the regression of democracy " , mr cheng said , according to the ap news agency .
" he opposed the authoritarian -lsb- nationalist -rsb- regime in taiwan and the communist regime -lsb- in china -rsb- and he wants sovereignty for taiwan , " mr cheng added .
he added that his client was in an " ok " condition for the time being .
mr chen could face up to four months in detention without charge to prevent him colluding with alleged conspirators .
he is accused of money laundering and illegally using a special presidential fund .
but his supporters say his detention represents a breach to his human rights .
some say they plan to protest on saturday outside the jail in which he is being held .

diabetes uk claims 6,500 pupils in england are not covered by school medication policies which ensure they get insulin injections when needed .
this means parents often need to visit during the school day to administer injections .
the charity wants ministers to force school inspectors to keep checks on the care of children with diabetes .
it is unacceptable for medication regimes to be changed to fit around school hours douglas smallwood diabetes uk thousands of children in the uk have type i diabetes , caused by the sudden loss of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas .
most are wholly dependent on regular blood testing and insulin injections to avoid severe complications - which can include diabetic coma and even death .
in the long term , poor control of diabetes can increase the risk of heart disease , stroke , kidney failure and amputation .
there is already evidence that blood glucose levels are poorly managed , with research in 2007 suggesting that only one in five children had their levels properly under control .
injection regimes are a particular problem at younger ages , when children do not have the skills or confidence to carry out testing and injections .
diabetes uk says its research suggests only 16 % of primary schools in england have medication policies which allow them to administer insulin .
toilet trauma this can mean that treatment regimes are changed to fit around school hours , or that children are not cared for properly in school .
the charity said that parents had told it of instances in which children had to inject insulin in school toilets , or , in one case , wait outside the gates for the arrival of a nurse .
douglas smallwood , its chief executive , said : " it is unacceptable for medication regimes to be changed to fit around school hours .

by julia berg bbc money programme escalating property prices have been a staple of dinner party conversation for years .
but in the last year , they have been replaced by a new topic : falling property prices .
there is no doubt that many people made a lot of money out of property in the last 10 to 15 years , while many others in their 20s and 30s have seen their dream of home ownership slip away .
but we all knew the bubble that was getting ever more inflated , could n't last forever and would eventually burst .
burst it did , around autumn last year - and we have been on an economic downward spiral since then .
now we are seeing people struggle with sudden increases in their mortgage payments , while repossessions have risen to a predicted 45,000 this year -lrb- already up 71 % -rrb- . "
the property market is a market in which prices go up and down ... liquidity can dry up much more easily than in a stock market " hidden costs of home ownership collapsing house prices are plunging 60,000 homeowners a month into negative equity and at current trends , two million households will enter negative equity by 2010 , outstripping the 1.8 million affected at the bottom of the last housing slump .
given all this and the predictions that the country could be on course for a worse crisis than the 1990s crash , some are starting to question whether it was such a good idea for the housing market to become a cornerstone of the british economy .
highly geared furthermore , we have n't hit the bottom yet .
house prices are predicted to drop by another 15 % in many areas and many believe they will not be back to 2005 levels for at least a decade .
for those able to hang on to their homes and stay put , this may not be a problem .
they will be able to return to the dinner party circuit and much like stock holders who hold their nerve , sit it out and wait for the recovery to begin .
after all , you only realise the loss if you sell .
but it has been a sober illustration that property investment carries risk , and that this is a risk exacerbated by gearing - the amount you have borrowed to make the purchase .
merryn somerset webb , editor of moneyweek says ; " when you buy a house , you borrow a lot of money to do it .
so say you 'll put down £ 10,000 , you 'll borrow £ 90,000 .
" when you invest in the stock market , you do n't borrow money to do it , you simply invest the money that you have .
" that means that you could lose everything you 've put in to the stock market , but you 'd still be evens , you would n't owe anybody anything .
" with a property , say you 've put in your £ 10,000 , the value of your property falls by £ 15,000 , you still owe the £ 90,000 .
you have a debt that could hang over you indefinitely .
" so , in that sense , investing in property is more risky than the stock market . "
housing lottery the question is : if you step back and look at property in comparison with other investments , is it really the money-spinner many of us have been led to believe ?
the buyer average house price -lrb- 1980 -rrb- : £ 23,348 average house price -lrb- 2000 -rrb- : £ 81,202 deductions : stamp duty £ 233 , legal and other fees £ 700 , maintenance £ 16,126 , mortgage interest £ 41,091 , capital repaid £ 14,942 overall loss : £ 15,238 sources : nationwide , savills , moneyweek what if , instead of sinking a large sum of money into a house and borrowing three to seven times your salary at various rates of interest over 20 years , you saved the money into a uk shares fund instead and rented ?
how would your investment work out ?
we all know that shares can rise as well as fall , but is it the same for investment in property ?
with the help of moneyweek , we compared four random time periods and looked at buying property versus renting and investing to see what would happen .
the results are surprising and show just how much of a lottery home ownership is .
to begin , we looked at what would have happened if you bought a house in 1980 and sold it in 2000 .
we started with the average price of a uk house in both those years .
then we deducted a typical deposit , stamp duty , solicitors and set up fees , maintenance , mortgage interest payments to see what profit -lrb- if any -rrb- was left .
the renter rental cost of average house -lrb- 1980-2000 -rrb- : £ 80,630 gain from buyer deposit if invested in shares : £ 101,339 gain from other costs if invested in shares : £ 21,179 overall gain : £ 41,888 sources : savills , barclays equity gilt study , moneyweek we compared that with taking an initial 20 % deposit and set up costs -lrb- like solicitors fees -rrb- and investing them instead in a uk equity income fund over the same period -lrb- see barclays equity gilt study 2008 -rrb- .
the conclusion will surprise many .
based on these figures over this period , the average homeowner would have made a loss of £ 15,238 .
meanwhile , the renter / investor would have made a gain of £ 41,888 .
note : we made several assumptions , such as the amount of deposit on the house -lrb- we assumed 20 % -rrb- and some assumptions about average rental costs over early periods because of the lack of reliable data .
we have also not included the potential saving a renter would have made by not incurring mortgage interest payments and maintenance costs - the biggest costs incurred .
had a renter invested these savings as well , the calculation would be even more in their favour .
timing is everything however , when we looked at three shorter seven-year periods , the figures came out very differently .
in the period 1993 to 2000 , both the renter / investor and the property owner would have made a loss .
however , the property owner comes out comparatively £ 15,000 better off , having lost just under £ 16,000 , whereas the renter / investor would have lost just over £ 31,000 .
in the other two periods , 2001-2008 and 1995-2002 , the house buyer comes out much better , given these were periods of rapid house price rises and a more volatile stock market , particularly during the period 1995-2002 which suffered the dotcom crash .
many of us remember the last housing downturn and the recession of the 1990s .
but for an entire generation of young homeowners , desperate to get on the housing ladder and follow a previous generation into becoming property millionaires , this exercise illustrates that far from property being the goldmine many have imagined , it is like investing in shares , a lottery - where timing is everything .

so say you 'll put down £ 10,000 , you 'll borrow £ 90,000 .
" when you invest in the stock market , you do n't borrow money to do it , you simply invest the money that you have .
" that means that you could lose everything you 've put in to the stock market , but you 'd still be evens , you would n't owe anybody anything .
" with a property , say you 've put in your £ 10,000 , the value of your property falls by £ 15,000 , you still owe the £ 90,000 .
you have a debt that could hang over you indefinitely .
" so , in that sense , investing in property is more risky than the stock market . "
housing lottery the question is : if you step back and look at property in comparison with other investments , is it really the money-spinner many of us have been led to believe ?
the buyer average house price -lrb- 1980 -rrb- : £ 23,348 average house price -lrb- 2000 -rrb- : £ 81,202 deductions : stamp duty £ 233 , legal and other fees £ 700 , maintenance £ 16,126 , mortgage interest £ 41,091 , capital repaid £ 14,942 overall loss : £ 15,238 sources : nationwide , savills , moneyweek what if , instead of sinking a large sum of money into a house and borrowing three to seven times your salary at various rates of interest over 20 years , you saved the money into a uk shares fund instead and rented ?
how would your investment work out ?
we all know that shares can rise as well as fall , but is it the same for investment in property ?
with the help of moneyweek , we compared four random time periods and looked at buying property versus renting and investing to see what would happen .
the results are surprising and show just how much of a lottery home ownership is .
to begin , we looked at what would have happened if you bought a house in 1980 and sold it in 2000 .
we started with the average price of a uk house in both those years .
then we deducted a typical deposit , stamp duty , solicitors and set up fees , maintenance , mortgage interest payments to see what profit -lrb- if any -rrb- was left .
the renter rental cost of average house -lrb- 1980-2000 -rrb- : £ 80,630 gain from buyer deposit if invested in shares : £ 101,339 gain from other costs if invested in shares : £ 21,179 overall gain : £ 41,888 sources : savills , barclays equity gilt study , moneyweek we compared that with taking an initial 20 % deposit and set up costs -lrb- like solicitors fees -rrb- and investing them instead in a uk equity income fund over the same period -lrb- see barclays equity gilt study 2008 -rrb- .
the conclusion will surprise many .
based on these figures over this period , the average homeowner would have made a loss of £ 15,238 .
meanwhile , the renter / investor would have made a gain of £ 41,888 .
note : we made several assumptions , such as the amount of deposit on the house -lrb- we assumed 20 % -rrb- and some assumptions about average rental costs over early periods because of the lack of reliable data .
we have also not included the potential saving a renter would have made by not incurring mortgage interest payments and maintenance costs - the biggest costs incurred .
had a renter invested these savings as well , the calculation would be even more in their favour .
timing is everything however , when we looked at three shorter seven-year periods , the figures came out very differently .
in the period 1993 to 2000 , both the renter / investor and the property owner would have made a loss .
however , the property owner comes out comparatively £ 15,000 better off , having lost just under £ 16,000 , whereas the renter / investor would have lost just over £ 31,000 .
in the other two periods , 2001-2008 and 1995-2002 , the house buyer comes out much better , given these were periods of rapid house price rises and a more volatile stock market , particularly during the period 1995-2002 which suffered the dotcom crash .
many of us remember the last housing downturn and the recession of the 1990s .
but for an entire generation of young homeowners , desperate to get on the housing ladder and follow a previous generation into becoming property millionaires , this exercise illustrates that far from property being the goldmine many have imagined , it is like investing in shares , a lottery - where timing is everything .

by julia berg bbc money programme the number of first-time buyers may fall even more , lenders warn escalating property prices have been a staple of dinner party conversation for years .
but in the last year , they have been replaced by a new topic : falling property prices .
there is no doubt that many people made a lot of money out of property in the last 10 to 15 years , while many others in their 20s and 30s have seen their dream of home ownership slip away .
but we all knew the bubble that was getting ever more inflated , could n't last forever and would eventually burst .
burst it did , around autumn last year - and we have been on an economic downward spiral since then .
now we are seeing people struggle with sudden increases in their mortgage payments , while repossessions have risen to a predicted 45,000 this year -lrb- already up 71 % -rrb- .
the property market is a market in which prices go up and down ... liquidity can dry up much more easily than in a stock market hidden costs of home ownership collapsing house prices are plunging 60,000 homeowners a month into negative equity and at current trends , two million households will enter negative equity by 2010 , outstripping the 1.8 million affected at the bottom of the last housing slump .
given all this and the predictions that the country could be on course for a worse crisis than the 1990s crash , some are starting to question whether it was such a good idea for the housing market to become a cornerstone of the british economy .
highly geared furthermore , we have n't hit the bottom yet .
house prices are predicted to drop by another 15 % in many areas and many believe they will not be back to 2005 levels for at least a decade .
for those able to hang on to their homes and stay put , this may not be a problem .
they will be able to return to the dinner party circuit and much like stock holders who hold their nerve , sit it out and wait for the recovery to begin .
after all , you only realise the loss if you sell .

the buyer average house price -lrb- 1980 -rrb- : £ 23,348 average house price -lrb- 2000 -rrb- : £ 81,202 deductions : stamp duty £ 233 , legal and other fees £ 700 , maintenance £ 16,126 , mortgage interest £ 41,091 , capital repaid £ 14,942 overall loss : £ 15,238 sources : nationwide , savills , moneyweek what if , instead of sinking a large sum of money into a house and borrowing three to seven times your salary at various rates of interest over 20 years , you saved the money into a uk shares fund instead and rented ?
how would your investment work out ?
we all know that shares can rise as well as fall , but is it the same for investment in property ?
with the help of moneyweek , we compared four random time periods and looked at buying property versus renting and investing to see what would happen .
the results are surprising and show just how much of a lottery home ownership is .
to begin , we looked at what would have happened if you bought a house in 1980 and sold it in 2000 .
we started with the average price of a uk house in both those years .
then we deducted a typical deposit , stamp duty , solicitors and set up fees , maintenance , mortgage interest payments to see what profit -lrb- if any -rrb- was left .
the renter rental cost of average house -lrb- 1980-2000 -rrb- : £ 80,630 gain from buyer deposit if invested in shares : £ 101,339 gain from other costs if invested in shares : £ 21,179 overall gain : £ 41,888 sources : savills , barclays equity gilt study , moneyweek we compared that with taking an initial 20 % deposit and set up costs -lrb- like solicitors fees -rrb- and investing them instead in a uk equity income fund over the same period -lrb- see barclays equity gilt study 2008 -rrb- .
the conclusion will surprise many .
based on these figures over this period , the average homeowner would have made a loss of £ 15,238 .
meanwhile , the renter / investor would have made a gain of £ 41,888 .
note : we made several assumptions , such as the amount of deposit on the house -lrb- we assumed 20 % -rrb- and some assumptions about average rental costs over early periods because of the lack of reliable data .
we have also not included the potential saving a renter would have made by not incurring mortgage interest payments and maintenance costs - the biggest costs incurred .
had a renter invested these savings as well , the calculation would be even more in their favour .
timing is everything however , when we looked at three shorter seven-year periods , the figures came out very differently .
in the period 1993 to 2000 , both the renter / investor and the property owner would have made a loss .
however , the property owner comes out comparatively £ 15,000 better off , having lost just under £ 16,000 , whereas the renter / investor would have lost just over £ 31,000 .
in the other two periods , 2001-2008 and 1995-2002 , the house buyer comes out much better , given these were periods of rapid house price rises and a more volatile stock market , particularly during the period 1995-2002 which suffered the dotcom crash .
many of us remember the last housing downturn and the recession of the 1990s .
but for an entire generation of young homeowners , desperate to get on the housing ladder and follow a previous generation into becoming property millionaires , this exercise illustrates that far from property being the goldmine many have imagined , it is like investing in shares , a lottery - where timing is everything .

by julia berg bbc money programme the number of first-time buyers may fall even more , lenders warn escalating property prices have been a staple of dinner party conversation for years .
but in the last year , they have been replaced by a new topic : falling property prices .
there is no doubt that many people made a lot of money out of property in the last 10 to 15 years , while many others in their 20s and 30s have seen their dream of home ownership slip away .
but we all knew the bubble that was getting ever more inflated , could n't last forever and would eventually burst .
burst it did , around autumn last year - and we have been on an economic downward spiral since then .
now we are seeing people struggle with sudden increases in their mortgage payments , while repossessions have risen to a predicted 45,000 this year -lrb- already up 71 % -rrb- .
the property market is a market in which prices go up and down ... liquidity can dry up much more easily than in a stock market hidden costs of home ownership collapsing house prices are plunging 60,000 homeowners a month into negative equity and at current trends , two million households will enter negative equity by 2010 , outstripping the 1.8 million affected at the bottom of the last housing slump .
given all this and the predictions that the country could be on course for a worse crisis than the 1990s crash , some are starting to question whether it was such a good idea for the housing market to become a cornerstone of the british economy .
highly geared furthermore , we have n't hit the bottom yet .
house prices are predicted to drop by another 15 % in many areas and many believe they will not be back to 2005 levels for at least a decade .
for those able to hang on to their homes and stay put , this may not be a problem .
they will be able to return to the dinner party circuit and much like stock holders who hold their nerve , sit it out and wait for the recovery to begin .
after all , you only realise the loss if you sell .
the property market is not always the sure-fire investment we think it is but it has been a sober illustration that property investment carries risk , and that this is a risk exacerbated by gearing - the amount you have borrowed to make the purchase .
merryn somerset webb , editor of moneyweek says ; " when you buy a house , you borrow a lot of money to do it .
so say you 'll put down £ 10,000 , you 'll borrow £ 90,000 .
" when you invest in the stock market , you do n't borrow money to do it , you simply invest the money that you have .
" that means that you could lose everything you 've put in to the stock market , but you 'd still be evens , you would n't owe anybody anything .
" with a property , say you 've put in your £ 10,000 , the value of your property falls by £ 15,000 , you still owe the £ 90,000 .
you have a debt that could hang over you indefinitely .
" so , in that sense , investing in property is more risky than the stock market . "

homelessness minister iain wright said the government was investing " record amounts " to prevent homelessness .

advertisement homelessness fears grow more than one in eight people fear they could be forced out of their homes during the current economic downturn , a survey has indicated .
they fear becoming homeless by falling behind on mortgage or rent payments , homelessness charity st mungo 's found .
it also found that 93 % of people using its london hostels became homeless in part due to financial pressures .
homelessness minister iain wright said the government was investing " record amounts " to prevent homelessness .
the uk survey questioned 2,014 adults earlier this month .
it found that 18 % feared becoming homeless and 67 % said they had cut their spending over the past three months .
we need a guarantee from the government that those who are hanging on by their fingertips wo n't be shaken off st mungo 's chief executive charles fraser the poll found that eight out of 10 respondents felt the government should be doing more to prevent people from losing their homes .
st mungo 's chief executive charles fraser said : " the most vulnerable people in society will suffer the most from the financial crisis and we must provide support for those who need it . "
he said the government must act urgently to avoid a " sharp increase " in people sleeping rough .
mr fraser added : " we need a guarantee from the government that those who are hanging on by their fingertips wo n't be shaken off . "
' last resort ' west-london based charity st mungo 's aims to house and support people who either have been , or are at risk of , sleeping rough .
homelessness minister mr wright said the government was supporting families through the economic downturn .
" we are helping people at risk of repossession remain in their homes through our £ 200m mortgage rescue scheme and working with lenders to ensure repossessions are only ever a last resort , " he said .
" at the same time we are investing record amounts in preventing and reducing homelessness and are looking at what more we can do to further reduce rough sleeping , which has fallen by nearly two-thirds over the last decade . "
earlier this month the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- said at least a million more people in england and wales could soon join waiting lists for social housing .
the lga blamed this on the current economic downturn .

the father of a teenage boy killed in a road accident is fronting a pro-seatbelt campaign in secondary schools .
keith houliston 's 17-year-old son neil died in a crash as he was returning to his home in selby , north yorkshire , on christmas day 2005 .
a coroner said neil would have survived had he been wearing a seatbelt .
neil 's story , told by his father , features on a leaflet being handed out to pupils at every secondary school in west yorkshire .
' not cool ' mr houliston tells how he coped in the first few days after the crash , as he came to terms with his son 's death .
the county 's local authorities have joined forces to distribute the leaflets .
councillor andrew carter , executive member for transport for leeds city council , said : " young drivers and passengers often feel that it is not cool to wear a seatbelt , especially if there are other people in the car not wearing theirs .
" wearing a seatbelt reduces the risk of death by about two thirds in the event of an accident .
" we hope that neil 's story will make young people aware of the risk of not wearing a seatbelt , and help to prevent other families from suffering the devastation of losing a loved one . "
