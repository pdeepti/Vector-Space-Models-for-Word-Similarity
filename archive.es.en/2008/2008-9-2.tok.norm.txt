peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .
he said a similar scheme had also worked well in the netherlands several years ago , with appliance prices remaining stable despite the program . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .

failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .

sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance .

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .
russia army forces have dug in north and west georgia , and operate some two dozen road checkpoints along roads in the region . energy dependency europe receives some 30 percent of its natural gas and 50 percent of its oil from russia . russia 's national gas monopolist gazprom on monday announced it would shut down supplies for some 24 hours for " maintenance " in coming days .
the switch-off was for routine technical reasons and not a pressure tactic aimed at europe , gazprom officials said . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance .

sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial market turmoil , housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth , " the oecd said in an interim assessment issued in paris .
while the organization 's short-term forecasting models " point to weak -lrb- economic -rrb- activity through the end of the year , " it said that many uncertainties about what is driving the economic situation " make for an unclear picture . "
still , the oecd steered clear of the word " recession " , even when describing britain , where it predicts the economy will shrink in the third and fourth quarters this year - activity typically associated with a recession .
the oecd 's chief economist , jorgen elmeskov , told reuters news agency that the british economy was stagnating , while continental europe was " barely crawling . "
g7 nations still suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market is still in a slump despite government efforts to recover from the sub-prime crisis and even though the us did better in the second quarter , its overall outlook remains sickly despite government efforts to kickstart the economy following the sub-prime crisis that sparked the global financial meltdown last year .
although elmeskov acknowledged that his organization 's quarterly forecasts are subject to sizeable margins of error , the oecd 's basic message is that the economy of the g7 - the us , japapn , germany , britain , france , italy and canada - was still " very weak . "
" continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy , itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices , " the oecd said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways the deal epitomizes the transfer scene in germany as clubs follow a prudent approach to player purchases .
spending in total is also down on the same stage last year when 194.38 million euros went on new signings . there has been nothing to compare with the buying and selling in england where almost as much - some 125 million euros -lrb- not including undisclosed fees -rrb- - exchanged hands in a single last day of transfer activity on monday . champions bayern munich have spent virtually nothing this summer , with defender massimo oddo joining last week from ac milan on a loan deal , while midfielder tim borowski arrived earlier on a free transfer from werder bremen . having spent more than 70 million euros before last season on several big names including france midfielder franck ribery and italy striker luca toni , bayern 's investments this summer have focused on the training set-up around new coach juergen klinsmann . hamburg , wolfsburg spend most the teams signing the biggest cheques this summer have been sv hamburg and wolfsburg , whose outlay on new players total around 28 million euros each .
hamburg were particularly active in the last week of august , signing the brazilian midfielder thiago neves for what could grow into a club record fee of 9 million euros , defender marcell jansen from bayern munich for 8 million and brazilian defender alex silva for 6.2 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart wanted to go to spain for a while striker mladen petric -lrb- 4.8 million -rrb- has also arrived in an exchange deal in which mohamed zidan moved to borussia dortmund .
hamburg have been able to invest thanks in part to the sale of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid for some 15 million euros , and defender vincent kompany to manchester city for 8 million . wolfsburg , backed by volkswagen , have carried on where they left off last season by investing heavily as they seek to join the country 's football elite .
with former bayern coach felix magath in a second season at the helm , wolfsburg signed two italian internationals in andrea barzagli , a 14-million-euro signing , and cristian zaccardo , costing 7 million , both from palermo , as well as the nuremberg midfielder zvjezdan misimovic for 4 million . defender bernd korzynietz from arminia bielefeld and swiss under-21 international marwin hitz from st gallen were added to the squad on monday , following the signing friday of brazilian caiuby francisco da silva . " our aim has been and remains to establish ourselves near the top of the bundesliga and to play internationally , " said magath who has already led the team into this season 's uefa cup . notable newcomers the third biggest spenders have been schalke 04 , who with new coach , dutchman fred rutten , are seeking a first german league title for 50 years .
schalke have dished out 15.5 million euros on strengthening the squad with peru striker jefferson farfan -lrb- 10 million from psv eindhoven -rrb- and dutch midfielder orlando engelaar -lrb- 5.5 million euros from fc twente -rrb- . bayer leverkusen have meanwhile made one of the most expensive signings in brazilian midfielder renato augusto , who has joined for 10 million euros from flamengo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann is back in germany other notable newcomers are khalid boulahrouz , who joins vfb stuttgart for 5 million , the 2007 champions having already acquired veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann on a free transfer from arsenal , and neven subotic , who dortmund signed for 4 million from mainz . newly-promoted hoffenheim , who have the financial backing of billionaire dietmar hopp , have invested 10.7 million euros on new players . the club , which has come up from the lower leagues and now aims to establish itself in the bundesliga , has signed among others the brazilian striker wellington from internacional porte alegro for 4.5 million euros . promoted cologne reached a deal with benfica in which portugal midfielder petit joined for nothing , with a fee only to be paid if and when he is sold on to another club . and werder bremen are yet another club to go for a loan deal in acquiring peru striker claudio pizarro , a former bremen player , from chelsea . among the last arrivals was the american midfielder michael bradley , who was signed by promoted borussia moenchengladbach on monday from sc heerenveen for 2.5 million euros . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police , who had eavesdropped on the plotters ' communications and intervened to surreptitiously confiscate the main ingredient in the explosives , arrested the men a year ago .
if the bombing had succeeded , it would have been germany 's bloodiest experience by far of islamist terrorism .
fritz gelowicz , 29 , daniel schneider , 22 , both germans , and adem yilmaz , 29 , a turkish national , are to be tried by a state superior court in the western city of düsseldorf , a spokesman for the prosecutors in karlsruhe said .
police say home-grown terrorists a big threat many germans are shocked that the men had ordinary german upbringings , unlike the radicals who were born in arab countries and moved to germany to plot the sept .

germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are set to name charismatic foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as their candidate for the chancellorship in elections next year , according to a report tuesday . spd federal chairman kurt beck , who would under normal circumstances be the candidate , had agreed to work out the party 's program for the september 2009 elections with steinmeier , the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- reported . it added that beck would put forward steinmeier 's name shortly after the bavarian state elections on sept .
28 . beck had previously indicated the decision on who would challenge incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor angela merkel would be announced " before christmas . " giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial market turmoil , housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth , " the oecd said in an interim assessment issued in paris .
while the organization 's short-term forecasting models " point to weak -lrb- economic -rrb- activity through the end of the year , " it said that many uncertainties about what is driving the economic situation " make for an unclear picture . "
still , the oecd steered clear of the word " recession " , even when describing britain , where it predicts the economy will shrink in the third and fourth quarters this year - activity typically associated with a recession .
the oecd 's chief economist , jorgen elmeskov , told reuters news agency that the british economy was stagnating , while continental europe was " barely crawling . "

although elmeskov acknowledged that his organization 's quarterly forecasts are subject to sizeable margins of error , the oecd 's basic message is that the economy of the g7 - the us , japapn , germany , britain , france , italy and canada - was still " very weak . "
" continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy , itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices , " the oecd said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 02.09.2008 science sets its sights on computer games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online gaming has become a multi-million euro industry many people claim that computer games are addictive and can lead to aggression .
but it is n't as cut and dry as all that .
a new long term study has shown that it is n't the games themselves that are the problem . it ’ s been 50 years since the american physicist william higinbotham introduced the world to the first computer game : tennis for two .
at the time it was used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of computers , but that first program led to the development of interactive games and virtual reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lan parties are a way for online gamers to be together physically as well as virtually today computer games are everywhere , and have become a part of the global youth culture - a culture that is forever reinventing itself , leading to continuous scrutiny .
that ’ s not without foundation , though often the criticism isn ’ t differentiated enough , believes fabian doehler with the japanese software firm sega . “ there are computer games whose content glorifies violence – which we don ’ t condone .
and there are video games that are potentially addictive , leading to someone losing touch with their social life , ” he said . doehler warned , however , that it ’ s too easy to look at just one aspect of the games .
he thinks it would be more interesting to compare those people addicted to the vast majority of gamers who aren ’ t . encounters in the virtual world most programs are party games , designed for friends who want to play together .
according to a long-term study by the university of leipzig , 80 percent of today ’ s youth prefer social games with friends over single player ones .
especially popular are music games like singstar or guitar hero , in which the player takes on the role of a musician . another genre with a growing following is the multiplayer online game , where thousands play together in a virtual world over the internet .
often it ’ s a regular group of people who meet on the web at set times to play the games .
multiplayer online games usually require a lot of time and a monthly fee .
world of warcraft , one of the most famous games in this genre has some 10 million players worldwide . cumpulsion to play although critics may target the amount of time spent playing as one of the biggest drawbacks to computer games , bernd schorb , expert for media education at the university of leipzig , said that the computer industry designs games this way on purpose . “ when world of warcraft costs 11 euros a month , those who market it have a great deal of interest in not losing anyone .
therefore they construct their game so that people stay with it , " he explained . approximately 10 percent of online gamers boast about being addicted .
on the positive side , almost every gamer in the virtual world of the internet sees it as a way of maintaining social contacts .
some 78 percent of users regularly meet up with their friends in multiplayer online games , and 48 percent have even made new friends there . 12 hours a day for many young people , computer games are part of their everyday life .
felix , a 21-year-old student and a passionate world of warcraft player , divides his time between the virtual and real world . “ for the two weeks leading up to exams i don ’ t play , i just study , ” he explained .
“ but normally i have enough time during the week to play and to study . ” for felix “ enough time ” means three to four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people spend up to 15 hours a day playing online games the situation is completely different for laura .
online gaming is an important part of life for the 18-year-old student from london .
it 's so important that she rarely has any time for her friends – or anything other than playing , for that matter . “ it ’ s fun and it ’ s my hobby .
i don ’ t have a job right now , so i just play all day long , ” she said .
“ that ’ s about 12 hours .
computer games are very important to me . ” a parent ’ s role hartmut warkus , a media teacher at the university of leipzig , knows that laura ’ s problem applies to a lot of online gamers .
he believes that parents are usually the ones to blame . “ we ’ re not going to lie .
what kind of parent isn ’ t happy when their children stay quietly in their rooms and they don ’ t have to be entertained for five or six hours ? ” he explained . but these parents shouldn ’ t wonder why their children are spending 15 hours a day on the computer five years later , added warkus . “ children won ’ t stop by themselves , ” said warkus .
“ therefore it ’ s important for parents to try and educate their children about this . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say it 's important to teach children self control when it comes to computer games age categories on games are also especially problematic .
many times children play games that are designed for an older audience – often with their parents ’ knowledge . it 's a disastrous development , according to karsten lehmann from the french software developer ubisoft , because the computer game industry puts a lot of trust in today ’ s youth . “ we try to connect to younger players at the very beginning of the development process .
i think that ’ s really important , ” he added . most gamers are normal teenagers the leipzig study does make one thing clear : no matter how computer game culture develops , online gamers are and will remain mostly normal teenagers , explained bernd schorb . “ through the survey we found a lot of cases of players , who have been playing 12 or 13 hours , and have just totally given it up , ” he said .
“ what usually causes this ?
normally it ’ s the one thing that can make a teenage life beautiful : finally having a girlfriend . ” andré sarin -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police , who had eavesdropped on the plotters ' communications and intervened to surreptitiously confiscate the main ingredient in the explosives , arrested the men a year ago .
if the bombing had succeeded , it would have been germany 's bloodiest experience by far of islamist terrorism .
fritz gelowicz , 29 , daniel schneider , 22 , both germans , and adem yilmaz , 29 , a turkish national , are to be tried by a state superior court in the western city of düsseldorf , a spokesman for the prosecutors in karlsruhe said .

police around europe say home-grown terrorism has become as big a threat as that from radical immigrants .
gelowicz , said to have led the plot , converted to islam and allegedly resolved five years ago to join the " jihad " or holy war against the west .

schneider was also indicted for the attempted murder of a policeman because he grabbed a gun and fired it while fleeing arrest on sept .

federal magistrates hearing the case have said the trio had planned to detonate several bombs " in the near future . "

" financial market turmoil , housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth , " the oecd said in an interim assessment issued in paris .
while the organization 's short-term forecasting models " point to weak -lrb- economic -rrb- activity through the end of the year , " it said that many uncertainties about what is driving the economic situation " make for an unclear picture . "
still , the oecd steered clear of the word " recession " , even when describing britain , where it predicts the economy will shrink in the third and fourth quarters this year - activity typically associated with a recession .
the oecd 's chief economist , jorgen elmeskov , told reuters news agency that the british economy was stagnating , while continental europe was " barely crawling . "
g7 nations still suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market is still in a slump despite government efforts to recover from the sub-prime crisis and even though the us did better in the second quarter , its overall outlook remains sickly despite government efforts to kickstart the economy following the sub-prime crisis that sparked the global financial meltdown last year .
although elmeskov acknowledged that his organization 's quarterly forecasts are subject to sizeable margins of error , the oecd 's basic message is that the economy of the g7 - the us , japapn , germany , britain , france , italy and canada - was still " very weak . "
" continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy , itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices , " the oecd said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial market turmoil , housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth , " the oecd said in an interim assessment issued in paris .
while the organization 's short-term forecasting models " point to weak -lrb- economic -rrb- activity through the end of the year , " it said that many uncertainties about what is driving the economic situation " make for an unclear picture . "
still , the oecd steered clear of the word " recession " , even when describing britain , where it predicts the economy will shrink in the third and fourth quarters this year - activity typically associated with a recession .
the oecd 's chief economist , jorgen elmeskov , told reuters news agency that the british economy was stagnating , while continental europe was " barely crawling . "
g7 nations still suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market is still in a slump despite government efforts to recover from the sub-prime crisis and even though the us did better in the second quarter , its overall outlook remains sickly despite government efforts to kickstart the economy following the sub-prime crisis that sparked the global financial meltdown last year .
although elmeskov acknowledged that his organization 's quarterly forecasts are subject to sizeable margins of error , the oecd 's basic message is that the economy of the g7 - the us , japapn , germany , britain , france , italy and canada - was still " very weak . "
" continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy , itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices , " the oecd said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial market turmoil , housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth , " the oecd said in an interim assessment issued in paris .
while the organization 's short-term forecasting models " point to weak -lrb- economic -rrb- activity through the end of the year , " it said that many uncertainties about what is driving the economic situation " make for an unclear picture . "
still , the oecd steered clear of the word " recession " , even when describing britain , where it predicts the economy will shrink in the third and fourth quarters this year - activity typically associated with a recession .
the oecd 's chief economist , jorgen elmeskov , told reuters news agency that the british economy was stagnating , while continental europe was " barely crawling . "
g7 nations still suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market is still in a slump despite government efforts to recover from the sub-prime crisis and even though the us did better in the second quarter , its overall outlook remains sickly despite government efforts to kickstart the economy following the sub-prime crisis that sparked the global financial meltdown last year .
although elmeskov acknowledged that his organization 's quarterly forecasts are subject to sizeable margins of error , the oecd 's basic message is that the economy of the g7 - the us , japapn , germany , britain , france , italy and canada - was still " very weak . "
" continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy , itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices , " the oecd said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "

" europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 02.09.2008 science sets its sights on computer games großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online gaming has become a multi-million euro industry many people claim that computer games are addictive and can lead to aggression .
but it is n't as cut and dry as all that .
a new long term study has shown that it is n't the games themselves that are the problem . it ’ s been 50 years since the american physicist william higinbotham introduced the world to the first computer game : tennis for two .
at the time it was used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of computers , but that first program led to the development of interactive games and virtual reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lan parties are a way for online gamers to be together physically as well as virtually today computer games are everywhere , and have become a part of the global youth culture - a culture that is forever reinventing itself , leading to continuous scrutiny .
that ’ s not without foundation , though often the criticism isn ’ t differentiated enough , believes fabian doehler with the japanese software firm sega . “ there are computer games whose content glorifies violence – which we don ’ t condone .
and there are video games that are potentially addictive , leading to someone losing touch with their social life , ” he said . doehler warned , however , that it ’ s too easy to look at just one aspect of the games .
he thinks it would be more interesting to compare those people addicted to the vast majority of gamers who aren ’ t . encounters in the virtual world most programs are party games , designed for friends who want to play together .
according to a long-term study by the university of leipzig , 80 percent of today ’ s youth prefer social games with friends over single player ones .
especially popular are music games like singstar or guitar hero , in which the player takes on the role of a musician . another genre with a growing following is the multiplayer online game , where thousands play together in a virtual world over the internet .
often it ’ s a regular group of people who meet on the web at set times to play the games .
multiplayer online games usually require a lot of time and a monthly fee .
world of warcraft , one of the most famous games in this genre has some 10 million players worldwide . cumpulsion to play although critics may target the amount of time spent playing as one of the biggest drawbacks to computer games , bernd schorb , expert for media education at the university of leipzig , said that the computer industry designs games this way on purpose . “ when world of warcraft costs 11 euros a month , those who market it have a great deal of interest in not losing anyone .
therefore they construct their game so that people stay with it , " he explained . approximately 10 percent of online gamers boast about being addicted .
on the positive side , almost every gamer in the virtual world of the internet sees it as a way of maintaining social contacts .
some 78 percent of users regularly meet up with their friends in multiplayer online games , and 48 percent have even made new friends there . 12 hours a day for many young people , computer games are part of their everyday life .
felix , a 21-year-old student and a passionate world of warcraft player , divides his time between the virtual and real world . “ for the two weeks leading up to exams i don ’ t play , i just study , ” he explained .
“ but normally i have enough time during the week to play and to study . ” for felix “ enough time ” means three to four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people spend up to 15 hours a day playing online games the situation is completely different for laura .
online gaming is an important part of life for the 18-year-old student from london .
it 's so important that she rarely has any time for her friends – or anything other than playing , for that matter . “ it ’ s fun and it ’ s my hobby .
i don ’ t have a job right now , so i just play all day long , ” she said .
“ that ’ s about 12 hours .
computer games are very important to me . ” a parent ’ s role hartmut warkus , a media teacher at the university of leipzig , knows that laura ’ s problem applies to a lot of online gamers .
he believes that parents are usually the ones to blame . “ we ’ re not going to lie .

police , who had eavesdropped on the plotters ' communications and intervened to surreptitiously confiscate the main ingredient in the explosives , arrested the men a year ago .
if the bombing had succeeded , it would have been germany 's bloodiest experience by far of islamist terrorism .
fritz gelowicz , 29 , daniel schneider , 22 , both germans , and adem yilmaz , 29 , a turkish national , are to be tried by a state superior court in the western city of düsseldorf , a spokesman for the prosecutors in karlsruhe said .
police say home-grown terrorists a big threat many germans are shocked that the men had ordinary german upbringings , unlike the radicals who were born in arab countries and moved to germany to plot the sept .
11 , 2001 suicide attacks on new york and washington using hijacked airliners .
police around europe say home-grown terrorism has become as big a threat as that from radical immigrants .
gelowicz , said to have led the plot , converted to islam and allegedly resolved five years ago to join the " jihad " or holy war against the west .
the precise allegations against the men were not disclosed , but the indictment accuses them of membership in a terrorist organization on german soil and abroad , which are two separate charges .
schneider was also indicted for the attempted murder of a policeman because he grabbed a gun and fired it while fleeing arrest on sept .
4 , 2007 .
earlier statements by the prosecutors said the group was assigned to carry out the attack by the islamic jihad union , a group of uzbek origin that has its camps in pakistan or afghanistan .

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .
he said a similar scheme had also worked well in the netherlands several years ago , with appliance prices remaining stable despite the program . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .
he said a similar scheme had also worked well in the netherlands several years ago , with appliance prices remaining stable despite the program . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .
he said a similar scheme had also worked well in the netherlands several years ago , with appliance prices remaining stable despite the program . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .
russia army forces have dug in north and west georgia , and operate some two dozen road checkpoints along roads in the region . energy dependency europe receives some 30 percent of its natural gas and 50 percent of its oil from russia . russia 's national gas monopolist gazprom on monday announced it would shut down supplies for some 24 hours for " maintenance " in coming days .
the switch-off was for routine technical reasons and not a pressure tactic aimed at europe , gazprom officials said . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now that commerzbank has agreed to buy dresdner bank , a lot of people are wondering if postbank will be the next to go up for sale . postbank , one of germany 's largest financial institutions , may soon follow dresdner bank onto the auction block .
in a press report released on tuesday , sept .
2 , the german logistics group deutsche post said it could decide by mid-september on the future of its banking subsidiary . unknown sources told the german daily handelsblatt that the supervisory board of deutsche post will meet on sept .
12 .
the logistics company owns 50 percent plus one share of postbank , but has made it known that it would like to sell the unit , which has 14.5 million clients . however , with the financial market being what it is , bidders are hard to come by .
deutsche post has been discussing selling the daughter company since mid-june , but experts warned that it would probably not get the 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- it sought , at least not in cash . georg kanders , an analyst with the commercial bank westlb told german dpa news agency that the postbank is certainly an attractive company , but that the timing is bad for making a sale . " if deutsche post is smart , they 'll put their plans to sell on the back burner , " he added . commerzbank , germany ’ s second largest bank , had said it was interested in placing a bid .
however , it announced over the weekend that it will buy the number three dresdner bank in a deal worth 9.8 billion euros .
the number one financial institution in germany , deutsche bank , could be a potential buyer if the board decides to go through with the sale . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now that commerzbank has agreed to buy dresdner bank , a lot of people are wondering if postbank will be the next to go up for sale . postbank , one of germany 's largest financial institutions , may soon follow dresdner bank onto the auction block .
in a press report released on tuesday , sept .
2 , the german logistics group deutsche post said it could decide by mid-september on the future of its banking subsidiary . unknown sources told the german daily handelsblatt that the supervisory board of deutsche post will meet on sept .
12 .
the logistics company owns 50 percent plus one share of postbank , but has made it known that it would like to sell the unit , which has 14.5 million clients . however , with the financial market being what it is , bidders are hard to come by .
deutsche post has been discussing selling the daughter company since mid-june , but experts warned that it would probably not get the 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- it sought , at least not in cash . georg kanders , an analyst with the commercial bank westlb told german dpa news agency that the postbank is certainly an attractive company , but that the timing is bad for making a sale . " if deutsche post is smart , they 'll put their plans to sell on the back burner , " he added . commerzbank , germany ’ s second largest bank , had said it was interested in placing a bid .
however , it announced over the weekend that it will buy the number three dresdner bank in a deal worth 9.8 billion euros .
the number one financial institution in germany , deutsche bank , could be a potential buyer if the board decides to go through with the sale . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is n't as cut and dry as all that .
a new long term study has shown that it is n't the games themselves that are the problem . it ’ s been 50 years since the american physicist william higinbotham introduced the world to the first computer game : tennis for two .
at the time it was used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of computers , but that first program led to the development of interactive games and virtual reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lan parties are a way for online gamers to be together physically as well as virtually today computer games are everywhere , and have become a part of the global youth culture - a culture that is forever reinventing itself , leading to continuous scrutiny .
that ’ s not without foundation , though often the criticism isn ’ t differentiated enough , believes fabian doehler with the japanese software firm sega . “ there are computer games whose content glorifies violence – which we don ’ t condone .
and there are video games that are potentially addictive , leading to someone losing touch with their social life , ” he said . doehler warned , however , that it ’ s too easy to look at just one aspect of the games .
he thinks it would be more interesting to compare those people addicted to the vast majority of gamers who aren ’ t . encounters in the virtual world most programs are party games , designed for friends who want to play together .
according to a long-term study by the university of leipzig , 80 percent of today ’ s youth prefer social games with friends over single player ones .
especially popular are music games like singstar or guitar hero , in which the player takes on the role of a musician . another genre with a growing following is the multiplayer online game , where thousands play together in a virtual world over the internet .
often it ’ s a regular group of people who meet on the web at set times to play the games .
multiplayer online games usually require a lot of time and a monthly fee .
world of warcraft , one of the most famous games in this genre has some 10 million players worldwide . cumpulsion to play although critics may target the amount of time spent playing as one of the biggest drawbacks to computer games , bernd schorb , expert for media education at the university of leipzig , said that the computer industry designs games this way on purpose . “ when world of warcraft costs 11 euros a month , those who market it have a great deal of interest in not losing anyone .
therefore they construct their game so that people stay with it , " he explained . approximately 10 percent of online gamers boast about being addicted .
on the positive side , almost every gamer in the virtual world of the internet sees it as a way of maintaining social contacts .
some 78 percent of users regularly meet up with their friends in multiplayer online games , and 48 percent have even made new friends there . 12 hours a day for many young people , computer games are part of their everyday life .
felix , a 21-year-old student and a passionate world of warcraft player , divides his time between the virtual and real world . “ for the two weeks leading up to exams i don ’ t play , i just study , ” he explained .
“ but normally i have enough time during the week to play and to study . ” for felix “ enough time ” means three to four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people spend up to 15 hours a day playing online games the situation is completely different for laura .
online gaming is an important part of life for the 18-year-old student from london .
it 's so important that she rarely has any time for her friends – or anything other than playing , for that matter . “ it ’ s fun and it ’ s my hobby .
i don ’ t have a job right now , so i just play all day long , ” she said .
“ that ’ s about 12 hours .
computer games are very important to me . ” a parent ’ s role hartmut warkus , a media teacher at the university of leipzig , knows that laura ’ s problem applies to a lot of online gamers .
he believes that parents are usually the ones to blame . “ we ’ re not going to lie .
what kind of parent isn ’ t happy when their children stay quietly in their rooms and they don ’ t have to be entertained for five or six hours ? ” he explained . but these parents shouldn ’ t wonder why their children are spending 15 hours a day on the computer five years later , added warkus . “ children won ’ t stop by themselves , ” said warkus .
“ therefore it ’ s important for parents to try and educate their children about this . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say it 's important to teach children self control when it comes to computer games age categories on games are also especially problematic .
many times children play games that are designed for an older audience – often with their parents ’ knowledge . it 's a disastrous development , according to karsten lehmann from the french software developer ubisoft , because the computer game industry puts a lot of trust in today ’ s youth . “ we try to connect to younger players at the very beginning of the development process .
i think that ’ s really important , ” he added . most gamers are normal teenagers the leipzig study does make one thing clear : no matter how computer game culture develops , online gamers are and will remain mostly normal teenagers , explained bernd schorb . “ through the survey we found a lot of cases of players , who have been playing 12 or 13 hours , and have just totally given it up , ” he said .
“ what usually causes this ?
normally it ’ s the one thing that can make a teenage life beautiful : finally having a girlfriend . ” andré sarin -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways the deal epitomizes the transfer scene in germany as clubs follow a prudent approach to player purchases .
spending in total is also down on the same stage last year when 194.38 million euros went on new signings . there has been nothing to compare with the buying and selling in england where almost as much - some 125 million euros -lrb- not including undisclosed fees -rrb- - exchanged hands in a single last day of transfer activity on monday . champions bayern munich have spent virtually nothing this summer , with defender massimo oddo joining last week from ac milan on a loan deal , while midfielder tim borowski arrived earlier on a free transfer from werder bremen . having spent more than 70 million euros before last season on several big names including france midfielder franck ribery and italy striker luca toni , bayern 's investments this summer have focused on the training set-up around new coach juergen klinsmann . hamburg , wolfsburg spend most the teams signing the biggest cheques this summer have been sv hamburg and wolfsburg , whose outlay on new players total around 28 million euros each .
hamburg were particularly active in the last week of august , signing the brazilian midfielder thiago neves for what could grow into a club record fee of 9 million euros , defender marcell jansen from bayern munich for 8 million and brazilian defender alex silva for 6.2 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart wanted to go to spain for a while striker mladen petric -lrb- 4.8 million -rrb- has also arrived in an exchange deal in which mohamed zidan moved to borussia dortmund .
hamburg have been able to invest thanks in part to the sale of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid for some 15 million euros , and defender vincent kompany to manchester city for 8 million . wolfsburg , backed by volkswagen , have carried on where they left off last season by investing heavily as they seek to join the country 's football elite .
with former bayern coach felix magath in a second season at the helm , wolfsburg signed two italian internationals in andrea barzagli , a 14-million-euro signing , and cristian zaccardo , costing 7 million , both from palermo , as well as the nuremberg midfielder zvjezdan misimovic for 4 million . defender bernd korzynietz from arminia bielefeld and swiss under-21 international marwin hitz from st gallen were added to the squad on monday , following the signing friday of brazilian caiuby francisco da silva . " our aim has been and remains to establish ourselves near the top of the bundesliga and to play internationally , " said magath who has already led the team into this season 's uefa cup . notable newcomers the third biggest spenders have been schalke 04 , who with new coach , dutchman fred rutten , are seeking a first german league title for 50 years .
schalke have dished out 15.5 million euros on strengthening the squad with peru striker jefferson farfan -lrb- 10 million from psv eindhoven -rrb- and dutch midfielder orlando engelaar -lrb- 5.5 million euros from fc twente -rrb- . bayer leverkusen have meanwhile made one of the most expensive signings in brazilian midfielder renato augusto , who has joined for 10 million euros from flamengo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann is back in germany other notable newcomers are khalid boulahrouz , who joins vfb stuttgart for 5 million , the 2007 champions having already acquired veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann on a free transfer from arsenal , and neven subotic , who dortmund signed for 4 million from mainz . newly-promoted hoffenheim , who have the financial backing of billionaire dietmar hopp , have invested 10.7 million euros on new players . the club , which has come up from the lower leagues and now aims to establish itself in the bundesliga , has signed among others the brazilian striker wellington from internacional porte alegro for 4.5 million euros . promoted cologne reached a deal with benfica in which portugal midfielder petit joined for nothing , with a fee only to be paid if and when he is sold on to another club . and werder bremen are yet another club to go for a loan deal in acquiring peru striker claudio pizarro , a former bremen player , from chelsea . among the last arrivals was the american midfielder michael bradley , who was signed by promoted borussia moenchengladbach on monday from sc heerenveen for 2.5 million euros . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance .

in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance .

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition , leaders agreed to ease visa restrictions for georgian nationals travelling to the eu and introduce improved trade agreements .
monitoring ceasefire and troop withdrawal on top of providing humanitarian and economic aid , the eu pledged to boost its civilian mission , which currently compromises about 40 people .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana also said the eu was planning to send hundreds of observers to georgia to verify if moscow is implementing the ceasefire agreement and withdrawing its troops .
russia has withdrawn most of its forces in line with a french-brokered ceasefire but has kept soldiers and equipment in " security zones " outside south ossetia and abkhazia that moscow claims are designed to prevent further georgian aggression .

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency .

berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .

germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are set to name charismatic foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as their candidate for the chancellorship in elections next year , according to a report tuesday . spd federal chairman kurt beck , who would under normal circumstances be the candidate , had agreed to work out the party 's program for the september 2009 elections with steinmeier , the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- reported . it added that beck would put forward steinmeier 's name shortly after the bavarian state elections on sept .
28 . beck had previously indicated the decision on who would challenge incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor angela merkel would be announced " before christmas . " giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is n't as cut and dry as all that .
a new long term study has shown that it is n't the games themselves that are the problem . it ’ s been 50 years since the american physicist william higinbotham introduced the world to the first computer game : tennis for two .
at the time it was used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of computers , but that first program led to the development of interactive games and virtual reality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lan parties are a way for online gamers to be together physically as well as virtually today computer games are everywhere , and have become a part of the global youth culture - a culture that is forever reinventing itself , leading to continuous scrutiny .
that ’ s not without foundation , though often the criticism isn ’ t differentiated enough , believes fabian doehler with the japanese software firm sega . “ there are computer games whose content glorifies violence – which we don ’ t condone .
and there are video games that are potentially addictive , leading to someone losing touch with their social life , ” he said . doehler warned , however , that it ’ s too easy to look at just one aspect of the games .
he thinks it would be more interesting to compare those people addicted to the vast majority of gamers who aren ’ t . encounters in the virtual world most programs are party games , designed for friends who want to play together .
according to a long-term study by the university of leipzig , 80 percent of today ’ s youth prefer social games with friends over single player ones .
especially popular are music games like singstar or guitar hero , in which the player takes on the role of a musician . another genre with a growing following is the multiplayer online game , where thousands play together in a virtual world over the internet .
often it ’ s a regular group of people who meet on the web at set times to play the games .
multiplayer online games usually require a lot of time and a monthly fee .
world of warcraft , one of the most famous games in this genre has some 10 million players worldwide . cumpulsion to play although critics may target the amount of time spent playing as one of the biggest drawbacks to computer games , bernd schorb , expert for media education at the university of leipzig , said that the computer industry designs games this way on purpose . “ when world of warcraft costs 11 euros a month , those who market it have a great deal of interest in not losing anyone .
therefore they construct their game so that people stay with it , " he explained . approximately 10 percent of online gamers boast about being addicted .
on the positive side , almost every gamer in the virtual world of the internet sees it as a way of maintaining social contacts .
some 78 percent of users regularly meet up with their friends in multiplayer online games , and 48 percent have even made new friends there . 12 hours a day for many young people , computer games are part of their everyday life .
felix , a 21-year-old student and a passionate world of warcraft player , divides his time between the virtual and real world . “ for the two weeks leading up to exams i don ’ t play , i just study , ” he explained .
“ but normally i have enough time during the week to play and to study . ” for felix “ enough time ” means three to four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people spend up to 15 hours a day playing online games the situation is completely different for laura .
online gaming is an important part of life for the 18-year-old student from london .
it 's so important that she rarely has any time for her friends – or anything other than playing , for that matter . “ it ’ s fun and it ’ s my hobby .
i don ’ t have a job right now , so i just play all day long , ” she said .
“ that ’ s about 12 hours .
computer games are very important to me . ” a parent ’ s role hartmut warkus , a media teacher at the university of leipzig , knows that laura ’ s problem applies to a lot of online gamers .
he believes that parents are usually the ones to blame . “ we ’ re not going to lie .
what kind of parent isn ’ t happy when their children stay quietly in their rooms and they don ’ t have to be entertained for five or six hours ? ” he explained . but these parents shouldn ’ t wonder why their children are spending 15 hours a day on the computer five years later , added warkus . “ children won ’ t stop by themselves , ” said warkus .
“ therefore it ’ s important for parents to try and educate their children about this . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say it 's important to teach children self control when it comes to computer games age categories on games are also especially problematic .
many times children play games that are designed for an older audience – often with their parents ’ knowledge . it 's a disastrous development , according to karsten lehmann from the french software developer ubisoft , because the computer game industry puts a lot of trust in today ’ s youth . “ we try to connect to younger players at the very beginning of the development process .
i think that ’ s really important , ” he added . most gamers are normal teenagers the leipzig study does make one thing clear : no matter how computer game culture develops , online gamers are and will remain mostly normal teenagers , explained bernd schorb . “ through the survey we found a lot of cases of players , who have been playing 12 or 13 hours , and have just totally given it up , ” he said .

germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are set to name charismatic foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as their candidate for the chancellorship in elections next year , according to a report tuesday . spd federal chairman kurt beck , who would under normal circumstances be the candidate , had agreed to work out the party 's program for the september 2009 elections with steinmeier , the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- reported . it added that beck would put forward steinmeier 's name shortly after the bavarian state elections on sept .
28 . beck had previously indicated the decision on who would challenge incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor angela merkel would be announced " before christmas . " giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are set to name charismatic foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as their candidate for the chancellorship in elections next year , according to a report tuesday . spd federal chairman kurt beck , who would under normal circumstances be the candidate , had agreed to work out the party 's program for the september 2009 elections with steinmeier , the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- reported . it added that beck would put forward steinmeier 's name shortly after the bavarian state elections on sept .
28 . beck had previously indicated the decision on who would challenge incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor angela merkel would be announced " before christmas . " giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are set to name charismatic foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as their candidate for the chancellorship in elections next year , according to a report tuesday . spd federal chairman kurt beck , who would under normal circumstances be the candidate , had agreed to work out the party 's program for the september 2009 elections with steinmeier , the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- reported . it added that beck would put forward steinmeier 's name shortly after the bavarian state elections on sept .
28 . beck had previously indicated the decision on who would challenge incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor angela merkel would be announced " before christmas . " giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance .

" financial market turmoil , housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth , " the oecd said in an interim assessment issued in paris .
while the organization 's short-term forecasting models " point to weak -lrb- economic -rrb- activity through the end of the year , " it said that many uncertainties about what is driving the economic situation " make for an unclear picture . "
still , the oecd steered clear of the word " recession " , even when describing britain , where it predicts the economy will shrink in the third and fourth quarters this year - activity typically associated with a recession .
the oecd 's chief economist , jorgen elmeskov , told reuters news agency that the british economy was stagnating , while continental europe was " barely crawling . "
g7 nations still suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market is still in a slump despite government efforts to recover from the sub-prime crisis and even though the us did better in the second quarter , its overall outlook remains sickly despite government efforts to kickstart the economy following the sub-prime crisis that sparked the global financial meltdown last year .
although elmeskov acknowledged that his organization 's quarterly forecasts are subject to sizeable margins of error , the oecd 's basic message is that the economy of the g7 - the us , japapn , germany , britain , france , italy and canada - was still " very weak . "
" continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy , itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices , " the oecd said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways the deal epitomizes the transfer scene in germany as clubs follow a prudent approach to player purchases .

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .
russia army forces have dug in north and west georgia , and operate some two dozen road checkpoints along roads in the region . energy dependency europe receives some 30 percent of its natural gas and 50 percent of its oil from russia . russia 's national gas monopolist gazprom on monday announced it would shut down supplies for some 24 hours for " maintenance " in coming days .
the switch-off was for routine technical reasons and not a pressure tactic aimed at europe , gazprom officials said . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are set to name charismatic foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as their candidate for the chancellorship in elections next year , according to a report tuesday . spd federal chairman kurt beck , who would under normal circumstances be the candidate , had agreed to work out the party 's program for the september 2009 elections with steinmeier , the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- reported . it added that beck would put forward steinmeier 's name shortly after the bavarian state elections on sept .
28 . beck had previously indicated the decision on who would challenge incumbent christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor angela merkel would be announced " before christmas . " giving in speculation has mounted in recent months that beck , who enjoys backing within the party but who , opinion polls show , has failed to make his mark on the wider electorate , would yield to steinmeier , who has a higher public profile , although less backing within the party . the two are to meet sunday to begin planning their strategy as the party , germany 's oldest political bloc with its roots stretching back to the trade union movement of the 1860s , plumbs all-time lows in the polls of around 20 percent . the party is divided on how to confront the rise of the left party , which draws its main support in the formerly communist east but has also provided a home for those in the west opposed to the reform course struck by merkel 's predecessor as chancellor , former spd leader gerhard schroeder . steinmeier , as schroeder 's chief of staff , is still closely associated with the agenda 2010 program , pushed through in 2003-05 over opposition from the party 's left wing . test of unity the chancellor issue looms as the party faces another test of its unity in the western state of hesse , where spd leader andrea ypsilanti narrowly failed to oust cdu premier roland koch in elections in january , leaving the state legislature without a clear majority . despite an earlier failed attempt , ypsilanti is putting out feelers once more in an attempt to form a minority government on the basis of tolerance by the left . the move is opposed by many within her own party who are fearful association with the former communists could prove electoral poison in next year 's federal elections . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peter hintze , a junior minister at the economics ministry in berlin , told an industry audience at the ifa electrical-goods fair in berlin on tuesday that the project was still under discussion by politicians , who say too much power is being wasted by old appliances .
the average german home freezer is 17 years old and the average refrigerator dates back 14 years , he said .
" our biggest potential energy source within the nation is the energy we can save , " he said in remarks to leaders of the appliance manufacturing industry at the annual expo of new products .
berlin would raise the 200 million euros needed annually for the scheme from sales to industry of carbon-dioxide emission rights .
friedemann stoeckle , an expert with the gfk german consumer-electronics association , said italy 's rebates for new refrigerators and freezers had lifted sales markedly .
the new appliances must meet the top european union energy-use standards , a + or a + + .
he said a similar scheme had also worked well in the netherlands several years ago , with appliance prices remaining stable despite the program . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .
russia army forces have dug in north and west georgia , and operate some two dozen road checkpoints along roads in the region . energy dependency europe receives some 30 percent of its natural gas and 50 percent of its oil from russia . russia 's national gas monopolist gazprom on monday announced it would shut down supplies for some 24 hours for " maintenance " in coming days .
the switch-off was for routine technical reasons and not a pressure tactic aimed at europe , gazprom officials said . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .

in many ways the deal epitomizes the transfer scene in germany as clubs follow a prudent approach to player purchases .
spending in total is also down on the same stage last year when 194.38 million euros went on new signings . there has been nothing to compare with the buying and selling in england where almost as much - some 125 million euros -lrb- not including undisclosed fees -rrb- - exchanged hands in a single last day of transfer activity on monday . champions bayern munich have spent virtually nothing this summer , with defender massimo oddo joining last week from ac milan on a loan deal , while midfielder tim borowski arrived earlier on a free transfer from werder bremen . having spent more than 70 million euros before last season on several big names including france midfielder franck ribery and italy striker luca toni , bayern 's investments this summer have focused on the training set-up around new coach juergen klinsmann . hamburg , wolfsburg spend most the teams signing the biggest cheques this summer have been sv hamburg and wolfsburg , whose outlay on new players total around 28 million euros each .
hamburg were particularly active in the last week of august , signing the brazilian midfielder thiago neves for what could grow into a club record fee of 9 million euros , defender marcell jansen from bayern munich for 8 million and brazilian defender alex silva for 6.2 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart wanted to go to spain for a while striker mladen petric -lrb- 4.8 million -rrb- has also arrived in an exchange deal in which mohamed zidan moved to borussia dortmund .
hamburg have been able to invest thanks in part to the sale of dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart to real madrid for some 15 million euros , and defender vincent kompany to manchester city for 8 million . wolfsburg , backed by volkswagen , have carried on where they left off last season by investing heavily as they seek to join the country 's football elite .
with former bayern coach felix magath in a second season at the helm , wolfsburg signed two italian internationals in andrea barzagli , a 14-million-euro signing , and cristian zaccardo , costing 7 million , both from palermo , as well as the nuremberg midfielder zvjezdan misimovic for 4 million . defender bernd korzynietz from arminia bielefeld and swiss under-21 international marwin hitz from st gallen were added to the squad on monday , following the signing friday of brazilian caiuby francisco da silva . " our aim has been and remains to establish ourselves near the top of the bundesliga and to play internationally , " said magath who has already led the team into this season 's uefa cup . notable newcomers the third biggest spenders have been schalke 04 , who with new coach , dutchman fred rutten , are seeking a first german league title for 50 years .
schalke have dished out 15.5 million euros on strengthening the squad with peru striker jefferson farfan -lrb- 10 million from psv eindhoven -rrb- and dutch midfielder orlando engelaar -lrb- 5.5 million euros from fc twente -rrb- . bayer leverkusen have meanwhile made one of the most expensive signings in brazilian midfielder renato augusto , who has joined for 10 million euros from flamengo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann is back in germany other notable newcomers are khalid boulahrouz , who joins vfb stuttgart for 5 million , the 2007 champions having already acquired veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann on a free transfer from arsenal , and neven subotic , who dortmund signed for 4 million from mainz . newly-promoted hoffenheim , who have the financial backing of billionaire dietmar hopp , have invested 10.7 million euros on new players . the club , which has come up from the lower leagues and now aims to establish itself in the bundesliga , has signed among others the brazilian striker wellington from internacional porte alegro for 4.5 million euros . promoted cologne reached a deal with benfica in which portugal midfielder petit joined for nothing , with a fee only to be paid if and when he is sold on to another club . and werder bremen are yet another club to go for a loan deal in acquiring peru striker claudio pizarro , a former bremen player , from chelsea . among the last arrivals was the american midfielder michael bradley , who was signed by promoted borussia moenchengladbach on monday from sc heerenveen for 2.5 million euros . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .

russian officials on the other hand had had a mixed reaction to the emergency summit . " what georgia needs is to consolidate the gains we have made through tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- , " gurgenidze said after talks in brussels with the eu 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner . " the free trade and the visa facilitation are indeed important pillars , although we are hoping for a comprehensive discussion on how this tightened integration -lrb- with the eu -rrb- can be achieved , " gurgenidze said . the premier also raised his estimate on the number of georgians needing long-term resettlement as a result of russia 's military intervention from 20,000 to 30-35,000 . ferrero-waldner said the european commission and individual member states had made a total of 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21.7 million -rrb- available for humanitarian aid to georgia . russia 's path of partnership diplomats from russia 's foreign ministry on tuesday said they were pleased with a european union decision not to impose sanctions on the kremlin over georgia . officials speaking to the interfax news agency said the eu 's choice at a crisis summit on monday to ask russia to remove troops in georgia , rather than attempt to exert economic or political pressure , was a sign a majority of eu nations were seeking " a path of partnership " with russia . the moderate eu position on georgia would assist " both sides in mutually-advantageous cooperation , " a foreign ministry spokesman said . some regrets but russian president dmitry medvedev said that the bloc had not understood his country 's motives for intervening in georgia . " unfortunately , there is still no understanding of what motivated russia to make decisions on repelling the georgian aggression and recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states , " he told euronews tv channel , according to reuters news agency . " this is sad , but not fatal because things change in this world , " he added .
" another situation , in my opinion , is more positive .
despite certain divisions among the eu states on the issue , a reasonable , realistic point of view prevailed because some of the states were calling for some mythical sanctions . " a minority bloc of eu nations led by britain and poland had been calling for immediate economic sanctions on russia as punishment , they argued , for the kremlin 's violation of a mid-august ceasefire agreement obliging georgia and russia to pull troops back to pre-war positions . russia defeated georgia in august 's ossetia war .
russia army forces have dug in north and west georgia , and operate some two dozen road checkpoints along roads in the region . energy dependency europe receives some 30 percent of its natural gas and 50 percent of its oil from russia . russia 's national gas monopolist gazprom on monday announced it would shut down supplies for some 24 hours for " maintenance " in coming days .
the switch-off was for routine technical reasons and not a pressure tactic aimed at europe , gazprom officials said . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

considering the sanctions against russia that had been discussed and called for by some eu states ahead of the meeting , this decision seems like a relatively harmless reprimand .
but it is n't . it 's a harsh and equally sensible reaction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the eu 's course of action is sensible , because the bloc has avoided escalating the charged atmosphere between russia and europe even further .
sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .
for russia , there 's more at stake than simply an agreement with the europeans on paper that does n't blush . president medvedev has to decide now whether russia wants to be the european union 's partner - or not . ingo mannteufel heads the deutsche welle 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.09.2008 analysis : caucasus conflict shows eu unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 27 members of the eu came to an agreement , achieving rare unity in its first-ever attempt to resolve a major international crisis on its own , the european union was able to achieve rare unity and issue a surprisingly muscular response to russia 's military intervention in georgia . for many in the european union , its threat to suspend a partnership and co-operation with russia unless moscow withdraws its troops from georgian territory represented a major advance in the bloc 's desire to have a big - and unified - voice in international diplomacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy believes the crisis is an opportunity for the eu after monday 's emergency summit in brussels , french president nicolas sarkozy said that this crisis was an opportunity for europe to go forward . " europe is in the first rank to prevent war , and europe spoke with one voice , " he added . in a declaration issued after the summit - the first of its kind since the 2003 invasion of iraq by the united states - the 27 eu members said that no further partnership talks with russia would be held until russian troops were withdrawn to pre-aug .
7 positions . the next negotiations are set for sept.15.
a week before that , sarkozy will head a high-level eu delegation to moscow to evaluate russia 's implementation of the six-point plan he drew up to end the war between russia and georgia . " the sept .
8 meeting is very important for the future of europe and russia , " the french president said .
presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance . "
in addition , russian giant energy supplier gazprom announced late monday that it would reduce gas supplies to germany from tuesday to at least thursday . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sanctions would have simply escalated the situation , which would have been harmful for russia and europe .
the eu , in its entirety , did not continue the " war of words " waged by georgia , russia and some european countries . but the eu 's decision is also harsh , as heads of state and government basically presented russian president medvedev with the choice of burying a political partnership with the eu or suffering a serious setback domestically . russia has agreed to the six-point-plan as a ceasefire agreement , but it 's not that easy for medvedev - according to his own logic - to recognize georgia 's territorial integrity and pull back russian troops that have moved into georgia to behind the old front line . the russian population and especially the russian military would not understand a withdrawal in light of the kremlin 's massive information campaign and a demonstratively displayed self-righteousness as far as the russian actions are concerned . the own propaganda is coming back to haunt them .
an order to withdraw could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the president , who was only elected a few months ago . that 's why this seemingly harmless decision by the europeans is really a hard nut to crack for the kremlin , which is now finding itself between a rock and a hard place . the decision has shown that the eu - despite its differences - is capable to have a tough and smart russia policy .

presumably , this means that a decision on the postponement of negotiations would be taken that day or shortly after . finding common ground in fact , the big question before monday 's emergency summit was if 27 nations with varying geopolitical and economic interests could concur on a single position on a conflict as fraught with risks as the one between russia and georgia .
the answer appears to be yes . sarkozy was quick to point out that the eu had been badly divided over iraq , but added that today europe is united around the propositions put forward by the french -lrb- eu -rrb- presidency . in fact , it could be argued that agreement on a common stand was more important for the eu than the stand itself .
failure to get all members to sign on to a strong statement condemning russia 's unilateral recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia would have set the bloc back decades in its efforts to speak with a single voice in international affairs .
this advance was accomplished by satisfying those countries who demanded tough action against moscow , such as poland and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some nations , like poland , were demanding tough action against moscow polish president lech kaczynski , who had earlier suggested that he would demand immediate sanctions against russia , and prime minister donald tusk , said they were satisfied with the results of the meeting , and particularly a reference to ukraine in the final declaration . " this is an important conclusion , " tusk said , while kaczynski noted that the eu was on the right path . in addition , the ultimatum to russia took into account britain 's hard-line stance demanding the suspension of the partnership agreement talks . six-point peace plan the final declaration also stated that the eu would hold a " careful in-depth examination " of its relations with russia , and that this evaluation would " begin now and continue in the run-up to the forthcoming -lrb- eu-russia -rrb- summit " on nov.14 in nice . the criteria for future decisions would be moscow 's " full application " of the six-point peace plan .
sarkozy said that this included the return of refugees driven out of their homes since the beginning of the conflict in the 1990s , the deployment of international observers to monitor the ceasefire and an international discussion on the security and stability in the breakaway georgian enclaves of abkhazia and south ossetia .
this last demand could lead to a major impasse . on sunday , russian president dmitry medvedev told russian television that moscow 's decision to recognize the breakaway provinces was " irrevocable . "
this suggests that , while the eu can be satisfied with what it achieved on monday , the diplomatic wrangling with russia has only just begun , and it could turn ugly . on monday , a german newspaper reported that russia will shut down its yamal natural-gas pipeline supplying western europe for more than a day this week for what was described as " routine maintenance .

world of warcraft , one of the most famous games in this genre has some 10 million players worldwide . cumpulsion to play although critics may target the amount of time spent playing as one of the biggest drawbacks to computer games , bernd schorb , expert for media education at the university of leipzig , said that the computer industry designs games this way on purpose . “ when world of warcraft costs 11 euros a month , those who market it have a great deal of interest in not losing anyone .
therefore they construct their game so that people stay with it , " he explained . approximately 10 percent of online gamers boast about being addicted .
on the positive side , almost every gamer in the virtual world of the internet sees it as a way of maintaining social contacts .
some 78 percent of users regularly meet up with their friends in multiplayer online games , and 48 percent have even made new friends there . 12 hours a day for many young people , computer games are part of their everyday life .
felix , a 21-year-old student and a passionate world of warcraft player , divides his time between the virtual and real world . “ for the two weeks leading up to exams i don ’ t play , i just study , ” he explained .
“ but normally i have enough time during the week to play and to study . ” for felix “ enough time ” means three to four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people spend up to 15 hours a day playing online games the situation is completely different for laura .
online gaming is an important part of life for the 18-year-old student from london .
it 's so important that she rarely has any time for her friends – or anything other than playing , for that matter . “ it ’ s fun and it ’ s my hobby .
i don ’ t have a job right now , so i just play all day long , ” she said .
“ that ’ s about 12 hours .
computer games are very important to me . ” a parent ’ s role hartmut warkus , a media teacher at the university of leipzig , knows that laura ’ s problem applies to a lot of online gamers .
he believes that parents are usually the ones to blame . “ we ’ re not going to lie .
what kind of parent isn ’ t happy when their children stay quietly in their rooms and they don ’ t have to be entertained for five or six hours ? ” he explained . but these parents shouldn ’ t wonder why their children are spending 15 hours a day on the computer five years later , added warkus . “ children won ’ t stop by themselves , ” said warkus .
“ therefore it ’ s important for parents to try and educate their children about this . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say it 's important to teach children self control when it comes to computer games age categories on games are also especially problematic .
many times children play games that are designed for an older audience – often with their parents ’ knowledge . it 's a disastrous development , according to karsten lehmann from the french software developer ubisoft , because the computer game industry puts a lot of trust in today ’ s youth . “ we try to connect to younger players at the very beginning of the development process .
i think that ’ s really important , ” he added . most gamers are normal teenagers the leipzig study does make one thing clear : no matter how computer game culture develops , online gamers are and will remain mostly normal teenagers , explained bernd schorb . “ through the survey we found a lot of cases of players , who have been playing 12 or 13 hours , and have just totally given it up , ” he said .
“ what usually causes this ?
normally it ’ s the one thing that can make a teenage life beautiful : finally having a girlfriend . ” andré sarin -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the advice booklet coincides with the launch of a charity in birmingham set up by the mothers of two teenagers who were killed in a drive-by shooting .
the home secretary said parents needed to know the signs of gang involvement and where to turn if they were worried .
but youth worker shaun bailey said by the time there were visible signs of membership it was " way , way too late " .
the guide has been produced by the home office in conjunction with police , local authorities , parenting organisations and community groups including mothers against violence .
slang words the booklet says young people join gangs for a host of reasons including excitement , protection or money from crime .
it tells parents to talk to their children about " the dangers and consequences of gang involvement " and offer them more positive activities to get involved in .
parents should also look out for certain changes in behaviour , including : has your child started to use new slang words ?
do they have any unexplained money or new possessions ?
do they have a new nickname ?
has their appearance changed ?
are they dressing in a particular style or " uniform " , for example , wearing a bandana ?
do they use graffiti style " tags " on possessions such as schoolbooks ?
do they have unexplained physical injuries ?
the guide also gives parents some advice on what to do if their child is already involved in a gang , such as seeking help from local youth organisations .
" it 's important to be clear that your child does have a choice , even when they think they may not , " it says .
tell-tale signs the guide 's release coincides with the launch of the new year shooting memorial trust , set up by beverley thomas and marcia shakespeare .
their daughters , charlene ellis , 18 , and letisha shakespeare , 17 , were killed in a botched gang attack outside a party in 2003 .
the trust will offer support to families and young people affected by violent crime as well as preventative measures including help with employment .
ms thomas said : " basically what the book is saying and what i would say - look out for certain signs of a child being active in a gang . "
she pointed to such behaviour as getting home late from school , spending more money and adorning school books with " street name " nicknames .
home secretary jacqui smith said : " all parents worry about keeping their children safe - and need support to help them to do it .
" they need to know how to spot if their child is involved in a gang and where to turn if they are concerned . "
' stay a child ' but youth worker shaun bailey told the bbc news website : " i do n't want to sound too critical because you have to respond somehow , but if you 're at the stage when you 're spotting these signs it 's way , way too late .
the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child shaun bailey , youth worker " only parents who have very strong relationships with their kids can step in then .
of course , some parents do , so it 's worth saying , but not all .
" the other thing is that writing things down like this solidifies the existence of gangs .
but gangs do n't exist in a solid , regimented , uniformed way , they 're much more fluid .
" membership is based on personal relations - family , friends , the people you live beside - not some middle class notion of a uniform . "
mr bailey , who runs youth organisation my generation and is also conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for hammersmith , said prevention was key .
" the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child .
" if you 've got an 11-year-old being drawn into a gang they are upping their level of sophistication , losing their innocence , being ' cool ' .
" what defends children from that is not being cool , and the best defence against being cool is being a child .
" so , do you talk to your kid ?
do you know where they are ?
do they have to come straight home after school ?
it 's those things that really matter . "

the advice booklet coincides with the launch of a charity in birmingham set up by the mothers of two teenagers who were killed in a drive-by shooting .
the home secretary said parents needed to know the signs of gang involvement and where to turn if they were worried .
but youth worker shaun bailey said by the time there were visible signs of membership it was " way , way too late " .
the guide has been produced by the home office in conjunction with police , local authorities , parenting organisations and community groups including mothers against violence .
slang words the booklet says young people join gangs for a host of reasons including excitement , protection or money from crime .
it tells parents to talk to their children about " the dangers and consequences of gang involvement " and offer them more positive activities to get involved in .
parents should also look out for certain changes in behaviour , including : has your child started to use new slang words ?
do they have any unexplained money or new possessions ?
do they have a new nickname ?
has their appearance changed ?
are they dressing in a particular style or " uniform " , for example , wearing a bandana ?
do they use graffiti style " tags " on possessions such as schoolbooks ?
do they have unexplained physical injuries ?
the guide also gives parents some advice on what to do if their child is already involved in a gang , such as seeking help from local youth organisations .
" it 's important to be clear that your child does have a choice , even when they think they may not , " it says .
tell-tale signs the guide 's release coincides with the launch of the new year shooting memorial trust , set up by beverley thomas and marcia shakespeare .
their daughters , charlene ellis , 18 , and letisha shakespeare , 17 , were killed in a botched gang attack outside a party in 2003 .
the trust will offer support to families and young people affected by violent crime as well as preventative measures including help with employment .
ms thomas said : " basically what the book is saying and what i would say - look out for certain signs of a child being active in a gang . "
she pointed to such behaviour as getting home late from school , spending more money and adorning school books with " street name " nicknames .
home secretary jacqui smith said : " all parents worry about keeping their children safe - and need support to help them to do it .
" they need to know how to spot if their child is involved in a gang and where to turn if they are concerned . "
' stay a child ' but youth worker shaun bailey told the bbc news website : " i do n't want to sound too critical because you have to respond somehow , but if you 're at the stage when you 're spotting these signs it 's way , way too late .
the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child shaun bailey , youth worker " only parents who have very strong relationships with their kids can step in then .
of course , some parents do , so it 's worth saying , but not all .
" the other thing is that writing things down like this solidifies the existence of gangs .
but gangs do n't exist in a solid , regimented , uniformed way , they 're much more fluid .
" membership is based on personal relations - family , friends , the people you live beside - not some middle class notion of a uniform . "
mr bailey , who runs youth organisation my generation and is also conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for hammersmith , said prevention was key .
" the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child .
" if you 've got an 11-year-old being drawn into a gang they are upping their level of sophistication , losing their innocence , being ' cool ' .
" what defends children from that is not being cool , and the best defence against being cool is being a child .
" so , do you talk to your kid ?
do you know where they are ?
do they have to come straight home after school ?
it 's those things that really matter . "

the advice booklet coincides with the launch of a charity in birmingham set up by the mothers of two teenagers who were killed in a drive-by shooting .
the home secretary said parents needed to know the signs of gang involvement and where to turn if they were worried .
but youth worker shaun bailey said by the time there were visible signs of membership it was " way , way too late " .
the guide has been produced by the home office in conjunction with police , local authorities , parenting organisations and community groups including mothers against violence .
slang words the booklet says young people join gangs for a host of reasons including excitement , protection or money from crime .
it tells parents to talk to their children about " the dangers and consequences of gang involvement " and offer them more positive activities to get involved in .
parents should also look out for certain changes in behaviour , including : has your child started to use new slang words ?
do they have any unexplained money or new possessions ?
do they have a new nickname ?
has their appearance changed ?
are they dressing in a particular style or " uniform " , for example , wearing a bandana ?
do they use graffiti style " tags " on possessions such as schoolbooks ?
do they have unexplained physical injuries ?
the guide also gives parents some advice on what to do if their child is already involved in a gang , such as seeking help from local youth organisations .
" it 's important to be clear that your child does have a choice , even when they think they may not , " it says .
tell-tale signs the guide 's release coincides with the launch of the new year shooting memorial trust , set up by beverley thomas and marcia shakespeare .
their daughters , charlene ellis , 18 , and letisha shakespeare , 17 , were killed in a botched gang attack outside a party in 2003 .
the trust will offer support to families and young people affected by violent crime as well as preventative measures including help with employment .
ms thomas said : " basically what the book is saying and what i would say - look out for certain signs of a child being active in a gang . "
she pointed to such behaviour as getting home late from school , spending more money and adorning school books with " street name " nicknames .
home secretary jacqui smith said : " all parents worry about keeping their children safe - and need support to help them to do it .
" they need to know how to spot if their child is involved in a gang and where to turn if they are concerned . "
' stay a child ' but youth worker shaun bailey told the bbc news website : " i do n't want to sound too critical because you have to respond somehow , but if you 're at the stage when you 're spotting these signs it 's way , way too late .
the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child shaun bailey , youth worker " only parents who have very strong relationships with their kids can step in then .
of course , some parents do , so it 's worth saying , but not all .
" the other thing is that writing things down like this solidifies the existence of gangs .
but gangs do n't exist in a solid , regimented , uniformed way , they 're much more fluid .
" membership is based on personal relations - family , friends , the people you live beside - not some middle class notion of a uniform . "
mr bailey , who runs youth organisation my generation and is also conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for hammersmith , said prevention was key .
" the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child .
" if you 've got an 11-year-old being drawn into a gang they are upping their level of sophistication , losing their innocence , being ' cool ' .
" what defends children from that is not being cool , and the best defence against being cool is being a child .
" so , do you talk to your kid ?
do you know where they are ?
do they have to come straight home after school ?
it 's those things that really matter . "
the gangs : you and your child booklet is available at www.direct.gov.uk and 30,000 copies are initially being distributed in london , liverpool , manchester and birmingham .

the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child " shaun bailey , youth worker " only parents who have very strong relationships with their kids can step in then .
of course , some parents do , so it 's worth saying , but not all .
" the other thing is that writing things down like this solidifies the existence of gangs .
but gangs do n't exist in a solid , regimented , uniformed way , they 're much more fluid .
" membership is based on personal relations - family , friends , the people you live beside - not some middle class notion of a uniform . "
mr bailey , who runs youth organisation my generation and is also conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for hammersmith , said prevention was key .
" the best way to keep your kid out of a gang is to keep your child a child .
" if you 've got an 11-year-old being drawn into a gang they are upping their level of sophistication , losing their innocence , being ' cool ' .
" what defends children from that is not being cool , and the best defence against being cool is being a child .
" so , do you talk to your kid ?
do you know where they are ?
do they have to come straight home after school ?
it 's those things that really matter . "
the gangs : you and your child booklet is available at www.direct.gov.uk and 30,000 copies are initially being distributed in london , liverpool , manchester and birmingham .

motorists have been warned to expect narrow lanes and a 50mph -lrb- 80km / h -rrb- speed limit controlled by speed cameras .

the highways agency said similar work was due to be carried out on the northbound carriageway of the avonmouth bridge in 2009 .
' smoother ride ' at times there will be a contraflow and the cycle path will remain open .
project manager david stock said : " the existing surface was laid during the previous strengthening contract which started in 1995 and has reached the end of its effective life .
" we will be using a new resurfacing material which unlike some of the existing material is able to be machine laid , providing an improved surface finish .
" the new material is designed to last longer and give a smoother ride than the existing surface . "
the work will be carried out 24 hours a day and three of the four lanes will remain open in each direction to minimise disruption , he added .
but drivers were advised to allow more time on their journeys due to expected delays during peak times .

john mccain , due to accept his party 's nomination to run for president , said it was no time for party politics .
calls from mr mccain 's wife , cindy , and first lady laura bush to support those threatened by gustav were made at the convention in st paul , minnesota .
meanwhile , vice-presidential nominee sarah palin has confirmed her unmarried teenage daughter is pregnant .
mrs palin , the alaska governor presented as mr mccain 's choice for running mate on friday , said her daughter bristol , 17 , planned to have the baby and would be getting married .
the mother-of-five , who is opposed to abortion , said her daughter would " have the love and support of our entire family " and appealed for privacy for the young couple .
more than 100 protesters were arrested after some broke windows asked to comment , democratic nominee barack obama said he believed " people 's families are off limits " and such stories should not be part of politics .
meanwhile , police in st paul used pepper spray as they arrested more than 100 protesters , some of whom threw bottles and broke windows .
many of those involved in the violence identified themselves to the associated press news agency as anarchists .
several thousand anti-war marchers had earlier demanded the return of us troops from iraq .

laura bush and cindy mccain appeal for funds she and president george w bush had been looking forward to enjoying the convention , she said , but events on the gulf coast had changed their focus to helping people living there .
mr mccain 's wife , cindy , then appealed for donations and support for relief efforts in the wake of the storm .
mr bush cancelled his planned opening night speech at the weekend and was in texas on monday to monitor relief efforts .
vice-president dick cheney also dropped plans to address the convention because he is going ahead with a trip to georgia , ukraine , azerbaijan and italy , the white house said .
after returning from a tour of relief preparations in mississippi on sunday , mr mccain said convention delegates had to put partisan politics aside and think of their country .
" this is an overwhelming thing .

" this is just one of those moments in history where you have to put america first . "
damage limitation mccain campaign manager rick davis said the republicans would work out how to proceed with the four-day convention on a day-to-day basis depending on the situation on the gulf coast .
gustav was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall west of new orleans , where hundreds of thousands of people had been evacuated over the weekend .
although it missed the city , the storm cut power supplies to 800,000 people as it advanced inland , bringing torrential rain and severe winds .
i incurred great loss in katrina , but my view is that the show must go on convention diary : show goes on gustav comes three years after hurricane katrina struck as a category three storm , killing more than 1,800 people and resulting in huge damage to new orleans and elsewhere .
instead of the planned gala night opening , monday 's convention business was low-key and lasted only a couple of hours .
the bbc 's adam brookes , in minnesota , says the republicans are keen to avoid the kind of political damage incurred by the bush administration 's clumsy response to hurricane katrina three years ago .
the party clearly can not afford to be seen hosting glamorous political events while the people of new orleans are once again fleeing their city , he says .
on monday , mr mccain helped volunteers in waterville , ohio , pack boxes of emergency relief supplies to be sent to people affected by gustav .
some 80,000 " care packages " , including items such as soap and toothpaste , are also to be assembled on the floor of the convention centre in st paul from wednesday , republican officials said .
donor list while monday 's convention programme focussed on combating gustav , tuesday 's agenda includes more a conventional schedule , set to include a keynote speech by former new york mayor and defeated white house hopeful rudolph giuliani .

mr mccain 's wife , cindy , then appealed for donations and support for relief efforts in the wake of the storm .
mr bush cancelled his planned opening night speech at the weekend and was in texas on monday to monitor relief efforts .
vice-president dick cheney also dropped plans to address the convention because he is going ahead with a trip to georgia , ukraine , azerbaijan and italy , the white house said .

gustav was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall west of new orleans , where hundreds of thousands of people had been evacuated over the weekend .

ty hafan near barry and ty gobaith in conwy both depend on charitable donations for most of their income .
the welsh assembly government says it has already increased support for child palliative care by 50 % .
it has also commissioned a report on how palliative care in wales is organised , due out in the autumn .
both hospices depend primarily on charitable donations for the majority of their income , with less than 20 % of their budgets coming from the assembly government and local health boards .
' goodwill ' " every year it gets more difficult , " said cath thompson , of ty hafan .
" we have to rely on the generosity of the people of south wales .
" the majority of our money is raised by public goodwill and through hard work and fundraising , " she said .
following a review of palliative care , the assembly government recently pledged to spend an extra £ 8m on support for adults and children over the next three years .
but the cost of running ty hafan alone is over £ 2.5m a year .
" we get a small percentage of funding from the welsh assembly government , however that is very small in comparison to the amount of money we have to raise every year , " added ms thompson .
the situation is similar for ty gobaith in conwy - with both centres planning major fundraising events later in september , during children 's hospice week .
terminally-ill children from the wrexham and powys areas receive their care across the border in england , at oswestry 's hope house .
family support families who have benefited from child hospice care say the support they offer is invaluable during a very difficult time .
four year-old molly kitson comes to ty hafan because of a rare , life-limiting genetic condition which leaves her unable to sit up , walk or communicate clearly .
her mother donna said the hospice was very different to the gloomy and depressing place some people might imagine .
molly kitson is one of the children to benefit from ty hafan 's support " she just loves being here , " mrs kitson explained .
" as we turn into the drive way in the car , molly has a big smile on her face . "
" even if she 's tired or upset , as soon as we come in to the building she 's totally calm - and she 's got that trust with everyone . "
a report on how end-of-life services should be run across wales is also expected during the autumn .
baroness finlay of llandaf , an expert on palliative medicine , has been asked by the assembly government to look at how changes can be implemented .
both ty hafan and ty gobaith are hoping that it will include an increase in public funding for children 's services .

advertisement the bbc 's damian grammaticas joins one group of survivors heading to a relief camp india has stepped up its efforts to assist half a million people displaced by severe flooding in bihar state .
reports say the military has poured fresh troops , doctors and medical equipment into the devastated north .
tens of thousands of survivors have crowded into unsanitary relief camps , where tensions are growing over the desperate lack of emergency supplies .
monsoon rains caused a river to change course cutting across bihar , affecting areas not normally prone to floods .
at least 75 people have been killed in bihar - but officials have warned that the death toll could climb once the situation in remote areas becomes clear .
reports suggest that some villages have simply been washed away by strong currents .
in the north-eastern state of assam , monsoon rains have caused the brahmaputra river to burst its banks , displacing hundreds of thousands of people .
more than 100 villages have been completely submerged in the past 24 hours , officials said .
across the border in nepal , tens of thousands of people have also been displaced .
disorganisation more than half a million people have been evacuated from the disaster zone , and officials hope to rescue the other 500,000 in the next few days , disaster management officials said .
the military said it was sending thousands more troops as well as helicopters and boats to bihar , which is one of india 's poorest states .
uncertainty in india flood camp how we rescued survivors in pictures : flood rescue effort see how the river changed course with the numbers of people in the camps expected to nearly double in the coming days , there are fears that poor conditions could lead to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera .
the united nations warned that " the heat , combined with limited supplies of safe drinking water and poor hygiene conditions , poses a great risk of water and vector-borne diseases " .
the temporary camps are being supported by volunteers and community groups , but a lack of central co-ordination is hampering efforts .
visiting the bageecha relief camp in purnea , the bbc 's sanjoy majumder could find no camp co-ordinator or government official in charge of distributing aid .
trucks and vans carrying aid stood parked on the highway as volunteers waited to be organised , he said .
the situation was symptomatic of what was happening across bihar 's flood-affected areas , our correspondent says .
massive costs the disaster began on 18 august when a dam burst on the saptakoshi river in nepal .
the saptakoshi , which becomes the kosi when it enters india , subsequently broke its banks in bihar .
officials in nepal say hundreds of people there have been hit by illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia , and an estimated 50,000 are homeless .
they say nearly 1,000 houses have been completely destroyed , and that power supplies and transport have been severely affected .
the costs to the economy are now estimated at one billion nepalese rupees -lrb- $ 14.25m -rrb- .
