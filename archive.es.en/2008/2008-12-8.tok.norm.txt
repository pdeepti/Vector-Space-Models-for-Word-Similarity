on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : human rights declaration honored on 60th anniversary after six decades , human rights remain a work in progress holocaust survivor still fights for human rights crime -pipe- 08.12.2008 60 years on , genocide convention still prompts debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the genocide in rwanda set legal precedents with life sentences for many perpetrators sixty years ago , the un adopted the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide .
this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic faces charges of genocide whether the same will happen at the yugoslavia tribunal with war crimes suspect radovan karadzic remains to be seen .
former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic died in prison before he could be sentenced , and karadzic 's wartime military leader , ratko mladic , still remains at large .
then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .
just because jurisprudence has to be created and the world is waiting for verdicts is no reason to start revising this definition . "
not a word to be used lightly another topic for discussion at the conference was misuse of the word " genocide . "
the prominent indictments against karadzic and el bashir have had the effect of popularizing the term , to the extent that it 's now even being used by animal activists describing the suffering of animals .
politicians also more frequently use the term in order to justify violence and military engagement .
" the bloody conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example , " said ten have .
" both sides deliberately spoke of genocide , even though in this case , it really was n't applicable .
we have to keep the term pure - both legally and politically speaking .
and we have to accept that it should n't be used lightly . " kerstin schweighöfer -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .
i am still keeping all options open , " she told bild , adding that her priority was to protect jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : human rights declaration honored on 60th anniversary after six decades , human rights remain a work in progress holocaust survivor still fights for human rights crime -pipe- 08.12.2008 60 years on , genocide convention still prompts debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the genocide in rwanda set legal precedents with life sentences for many perpetrators sixty years ago , the un adopted the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide .
this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic faces charges of genocide whether the same will happen at the yugoslavia tribunal with war crimes suspect radovan karadzic remains to be seen .
former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic died in prison before he could be sentenced , and karadzic 's wartime military leader , ratko mladic , still remains at large .
then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .
just because jurisprudence has to be created and the world is waiting for verdicts is no reason to start revising this definition . "
not a word to be used lightly another topic for discussion at the conference was misuse of the word " genocide . "
the prominent indictments against karadzic and el bashir have had the effect of popularizing the term , to the extent that it 's now even being used by animal activists describing the suffering of animals .
politicians also more frequently use the term in order to justify violence and military engagement .
" the bloody conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example , " said ten have .
" both sides deliberately spoke of genocide , even though in this case , it really was n't applicable .
we have to keep the term pure - both legally and politically speaking .
and we have to accept that it should n't be used lightly . " kerstin schweighöfer -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.12.2008 eu increases pakistan aid as islamabad 's crackdown continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes that the increase in aid will help pakistan quell its extremist problem the eu will increase its aid to pakistan to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- over the next three years , the bloc 's external affairs commissioner said monday , dec .
8 as pakistan kept up its renewed crackdown on terrorists . the money is to be directed at boosting eu programs in the field of education , trade and farming in pakistan 's north-west , a tribal area bordering afghanistan .
" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .
aid pledge comes after insurgent attacks on us vehicles the discussions in brussels were taking place amid reports that pakistani insurgents had torched more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for us and nato forces in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : the pre-dawn attack took place on the periphery of peshawar city , where hundreds of militants on sunday raided two parking bays for nato-bound lorries and set ablaze around 150 vehicles and cargo containers , some loaded with armored humvees for the us military .
in monday 's attack , an unknown number of attackers forced their way into a truck terminal and set rows of flatbed trailers on fire , gutting the supplies loaded on them , peshawar police officer anwar zeb said . zeb said there were no reports of any casualties in the incident , the third of its kind in the area in a week . attacks on trucks hauling cargo for the western forces have recently seen a surge in peshawar , where the vehicles are parked at night before moving on to the khyber pass to cross into landlocked afghanistan . the mountain pass in the militant-infested tribal region is part of a major supply line for the international troops , who receive three-fourths of their food , fuel and military supplies through pakistan .
pakistan 's battle against extremists has become a major concern , given their use of its territory to fight nato-led troops in afghanistan , and the eu 's anti-terror coordinator gilles de kerchove is set to travel there in january .
eu looking to deepend relations with pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner said a free-trade deal will be discussed in 2009 pakistan is also pushing for a free-trade agreement with the eu .
but ferrero-waldner suggested monday that no decision would be taken by eu governments until early next year .
meanwhile , the eu is about to send a ministerial-level group of diplomats to islamabad with the aim of boosting political dialogue , officials said prior to monday 's meeting .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels on monday , were also expected to commit themselves " to intensify political dialogue and deepen relations with pakistan , " according to a draft statement prepared for the talks .
" the eu will jointly explore with the government of pakistan how to intensify dialogue in the areas of trade and development , intercultural exchange , non-proliferation , human rights , migration , counter-terrorism and radicalization and education , " added the text .
acknowledging the " complex and urgent challenges pakistan is facing " , the ministers will look to develop political dialogue through a visit soon to pakistan by a delegation including eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the possibility of " consultations taking place at the highest level " will also be considered .
islamabad 's reaction leads to mumbai suspect arrest meanwhile , pakistan arrested a senior leader of the group widely suspected of being behind the mumbai attacks , responding to intense us pressure to crack down on militants , an official said monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mumbai terrorists have been linked to pakistan zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi - who according to indian media reports was named by the lone surviving gunman as a key planner of the attacks - was detained with 14 other people during a raid on a camp in the disputed region of kashmir .
the arrests late on sunday came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice said there was evidence that pakistan had been used by " non-state actors " to mount the deadly assaults on india 's financial capital .
the 15 men arrested in pakistan-controlled kashmir were at a camp run by a charity closely linked to lashkar-e-taiba - the group at the centre of investigations into the mumbai siege , an intelligence official said .
" security forces raided a relief camp set up by jamaat-ud-dawa , " he said .
the raid was to gather information " in the wake of allegations by india that let -lrb- lashkar-e-taiba -rrb- was using pakistani territory for training , " he added .
jamaat-ud-dawa is run by hafiz saeed , who founded lashkar-e-taiba in 1989 .
he reportedly abandoned let when it was outlawed in pakistan after india alleged it was behind a 2001 attack on the indian parliament in new delhi .

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .

" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .

meanwhile , the eu is about to send a ministerial-level group of diplomats to islamabad with the aim of boosting political dialogue , officials said prior to monday 's meeting .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels on monday , were also expected to commit themselves " to intensify political dialogue and deepen relations with pakistan , " according to a draft statement prepared for the talks .
" the eu will jointly explore with the government of pakistan how to intensify dialogue in the areas of trade and development , intercultural exchange , non-proliferation , human rights , migration , counter-terrorism and radicalization and education , " added the text .

leagues without a break , such as the english premiership , have long looked to germany with envious glances as its teams toil away through a cold and busy winter schedule . the winter break has also been cited as one of the reasons for the german national team doing so well in international competitions , as its players are fresher by the time the big summer tournaments come around . however , contrary to this belief , the dfb said the intended reduction of the break will allow the national team to prepare in better conditions for the 2010 world cup in south africa , should it qualify .
the thinking behind this is that the season will end sooner , giving the players more of a break before the world cup begins in june 2010 . soccer organizations see world cup benefits the opening round of matches of the 2009-10 season will be held between aug .
7-10 with the 34th and final round of matches coming on may 8 , 2010 .
the winter break will be between dec .
21 and jan .
15 . " the compromise found by the federation and the german league is absolutely positive for preparations for the 2010 world cup , " federation secretary-general wolfgang niersbach said . german league chief holger hieronymus also welcomed the move , for different reasons . " our championship has the longest break in europe , " he said .
" we need to have more weekend games because those played in midweek are n't interesting enough for the clubs from a financial point of view , or for the fans .

germany , in particular , prefers a diplomatic solution . eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the un request to send peacekeeping troops to dr congo .
france , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , had ruled out the deployment of european forces .
but pressure on ministers to act has increased following an appeal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who said europe should help reinforce un peacekeepers in the former belgian colony until more un troops can be deployed .
" it is urgent that we take a decision on such a bridging force -lrb- to dr congo -rrb- , which to my mind is absolutely necessary , " said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht .
de gucht had said earlier december that an eu peacekeeping force for dr congo would be unlikely as no one country was prepared to lead such a mission .
eu troops ready some 250,000 civilians have been displaced in the east of the dr congo since the summer as a result of renewed clashes between government forces and tutsi rebels led by renegade general laurent nkunda .
de gucht said an eu mission would need up to 3,000 heavily-armed soldiers , which would fill in immediate shortages .
finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said the eu should consider deploying its battle groups .
the eu has two such corps , each consisting of about 1,500 soldiers , on standby .
these troops are deployable at short notice anywhere in the world but have remained unused to date .
" if we do n't send them to congo , where do we send them ? "

monday 's gathering was largely designed to prepare the groundwork for this week 's eu summit of heads of state .
the situation in zimbabwe and relations with pakistan were also to be discussed .

france , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , had ruled out the deployment of european forces .
but pressure on ministers to act has increased following an appeal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who said europe should help reinforce un peacekeepers in the former belgian colony until more un troops can be deployed .
" it is urgent that we take a decision on such a bridging force -lrb- to dr congo -rrb- , which to my mind is absolutely necessary , " said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht .
de gucht had said earlier december that an eu peacekeeping force for dr congo would be unlikely as no one country was prepared to lead such a mission .
eu troops ready some 250,000 civilians have been displaced in the east of the dr congo since the summer as a result of renewed clashes between government forces and tutsi rebels led by renegade general laurent nkunda .
de gucht said an eu mission would need up to 3,000 heavily-armed soldiers , which would fill in immediate shortages .
finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said the eu should consider deploying its battle groups .
the eu has two such corps , each consisting of about 1,500 soldiers , on standby .
these troops are deployable at short notice anywhere in the world but have remained unused to date .
" if we do n't send them to congo , where do we send them ? "
stubb asked .

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .

two officers involved in the shooting were arrested on sunday . according to greek television reports , almost all of the 150 hooded youths who had sought shelter inside the polytechnic university , which is off-limits to police under greek law , had left the building .
at least 40 people were injured in the riots , which raged since saturday .
the unrest left athens and the northern port city of thessaloniki resembling war zones as self-styled anarchists torched cars , banks , police precincts , car dealerships , government buildings , private homes and stores and erected barricades that were set ablaze .

" the state needs to protect society , " said the prime minister in a live televised address .
" the emotions that followed the tragic incident can not and will not be tolerated . "
but despite the pleas , violence erupted again with many fearing it would continue unabated for days .
hundreds of students , armed with fire bombs and stones , clashed with police and smashed storefronts in the northern port city of thessaloniki on monday while gangs of youths attacked police stations and government buildings in athens .
from the northern city of veria to the central city of trikala , students battled riot police who retaliated by firing tear gas .
on crete , gangs of high school students threw chairs , wood and rocks at security forces .
authorities fear unrest could last for days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with more demonstrations planned , police fear more violence officials said they expect more demonstrations and unrest in athens as students and the greek communist party are expected to hold protests throughout the day .
with a 24-hour general strike called for wednesday , many expressed fears that the demonstrations could last for days .
confrontations between protesters and police also broke out in berlin , london and cyprus as youths occupied greek diplomatic missions .
in london , some 40 demonstrators pulled down the greek flag and raised a red and black anarchists ' banner at the greek embassy .
the widespread riots that hit greece began shortly after the fatal shooting of a teenager in the central athens ' bohemian district of exarchia on saturday .
the area , haunt of artists but also of drug addicts and petty criminals , is considered one of the city 's most violent areas .
clashes between police and youths , eager to challenge authority , occur almost nightly .
the exact circumstances are still unclear surrounding the shooting of the boy - whose age was reported in varying accounts as either 15 or 16 .
police said the shooting occurred after groups of youths began attacking a police car with stones and firebombs .
a purported warning shot by a police officer inflicted a serious stomach wound to the teenager , who died on arrival at a hospital .
police accused of " cold-blooded murder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have spread to other european cities witnesses claim that there was only a verbal exchange between the youths and police , and that the police officer shot fired into the group .

" more demonstrations mean more trouble , " said panagiotis likas , a shopkeeper in the tourist area of plaka .
" i do n't think i will be keeping my shop open for very long today . "
the shooting of the boy hit a raw spot for thousands of greeks and youngsters , disillusioned by scandals , economic discontent and growing poverty .
news of the shooting spread like wildfire and after 24-hours of rioting the center of athens , the northern port city of thessaloniki and other cities such as patras , ioannina , hania and iraklio looked like a war zone .
greek cities turned into war-zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : businesses have been torched as the riots spread dozens of people have been injured and scores of businesses destroyed during greece 's worst rioting in decades .

entire streets and avenues remained blocked by burned and overturned vehicles , and garbage bins and teargas filled the air in areas of athens and thessaloniki .
at least 25 police were reported injured - four seriously - and 11 civilians were reported hospitalized in athens , three in patras and one in thessaloniki with injuries sustained during the riots .
the shooting has been described by the media as one of the worst incidents of police violence in more than a decade and the first time since 1985 that greek police have killed a minor .
karamanlis ' government faced a series of protests from labor groups and students in recent months .

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .

" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .
britain and france not ganging up against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world have started rebounding .
" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .
the leaders ' meeting will be followed by hour-long talks with some 50 economists and business leaders including lakshmi mittal , boss of steelmaker arcelormittal , bank of england governor mervyn king and the ceo of french oil giant total , christophe de margerie . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .
britain and france not ganging up against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world have started rebounding .
" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .
the leaders ' meeting will be followed by hour-long talks with some 50 economists and business leaders including lakshmi mittal , boss of steelmaker arcelormittal , bank of england governor mervyn king and the ceo of french oil giant total , christophe de margerie . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "

last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .
just because jurisprudence has to be created and the world is waiting for verdicts is no reason to start revising this definition . "
not a word to be used lightly another topic for discussion at the conference was misuse of the word " genocide . "
the prominent indictments against karadzic and el bashir have had the effect of popularizing the term , to the extent that it 's now even being used by animal activists describing the suffering of animals .

the council aims to beautify the area and make it more fit for regular living and commerce by closing around half of the 482 prostitution windows and 76 licensed cannabis coffee shops in operation there .
the plan is set to be in full swing by 2018 .
" the ambition is to turn -lrb- the city center -rrb- into a safer , more beautiful and liveable area , " the city council said in a statement .
" although the sex industry and coffee shops will no longer dominate the area , they will not disappear altogether , " it added .
" this is part of amsterdam 's enormous strength , so it is important to ensure that the unique character of this district is retained . "
amsterdam council has already closed 109 sex windows , from which prostitutes lure customers , since it announced its initial clean-up plans a year ago .
battling criminality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human traffickers bring women to amsterdam prostitution was legalized in the netherlands in 2000 .
the consumption and possession of less than five grams of cannabis were decriminalized in 1976 , although its cultivation remains illegal .
while liberal-minded dutch have tolerated this contradictory system of cannabis being grown and dealt illegally to legal vendors , the planned amsterdam closures - and a spate of other measures taken by smaller town councils around the netherlands to close all cannabis coffee shops - mark a growing concern that the system is breeding crime .
" money laundering , extortion and human trafficking are things you do not see on the surface but they are hurting people and the city .
we want to fight this , " amsterdam deputy mayor lodewijk asscher told news agency reuters on saturday , dec .
6 .
the council statement said " low-level economic activities and crime-sensitive sectors " had become over-represented and were affecting the economic climate and living conditions in the red-light district .
" we still believe that regulation is a better solution -lrb- than banning -rrb- , but we have allowed it to become too massive , " asscher said .
" this is a necessary correction .
" we can still have sex and drugs , but in a way that shows the city is in control . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group is accused of being involved in the recent terror attacks in the indian commercial city of mumbai .
tensions are high in india and pakistan . the string of allegations and the media hype in india since the mumbai attacks have triggered some fears of an armed conflict with pakistan .
early last week , leaders in washington and london in particular felt the need to intervene to pacify angry indians and to urge pakistan to cooperate in the investigations into the attacks .
but mutual allegations and expressions of mistrust continue to cause alarm .
special cabinet session it was against this context that pakistan 's cabinet committee on defence held an unusual session on monday , despite a public holiday .
the presence of the prime minister , the army chief and the head of the mighty inter services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- underscored the sense of urgency that the indian government 's belligerent statements have triggered in islamabad .
information minister sherry rehman told media after the meeting that pakistan was “ a responsible , democratic state , committed to safeguarding its national interest and fulfilling its international obligations . ”
she said pakistan “ rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations and recognises that actions against terrorism are integral to its core interests , ” saying pakistan would comply with the indian investigation and would do its utmost to uproot terror networks wherever they were .
islamabad under international pressure observers claim that international pressure has shaken pakistan 's fragile democratic government , which has been trying to demonstrate its readiness to take part in anti-terror investigations .
but former minister wazir jogezai said that building pressure on pakistan alone could be counterproductive .
he said it could “ strengthen the agents of destruction ” and that pressure should be applied “ with lots of care and intelligence . ”
“ it is not only a military question .
it is an intellectual and material question .
pakistan has to be helped intellectually , materially and militarily . ”
isi officers have terror links , says us the media both in pakistan and outside have running reports for days now that the us has asked for access to a few senior isi officers including one of its former heads , general hameed gul , whom they reportedly want to put on the international terror list , accusing them of having links with islamist groups .
wazir jogezai thinks this is absurd and “ nonsensical ” and that if the us wants to make such “ demands ” then the american university of nebraska “ should be taken to task ” for its involvement in changing the afghan curriculum in the late 1970s .
soon after the cia began arming the anti-soviet russian resistance in afghanistan , the university was commissioned to revise the text books for afghan children in such a way as to inject the spirit of jihad in them .
after the fall of the taliban seven years ago , the american administration again spent several million dollars to revise afghan school text books .
many pakistanis hold the united states equally responsible for the conditions that afghanistan and pakistan find themselves itself in today . imtiaz gul -lrb- islamabad -rrb- 08/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 germany absent from london mini-summit on financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , along with the eu 's barroso , joined britain 's brown to discuss the crisis britain and france are not in cahoots against germany , but monday 's mini-summit on eu measures to stimulate the european economy , is most notable for the absence of chancellor angela merkel . an impromptu mini-summit in london on the financial crisis is being attended by britain 's gordon brown , france 's nicolas sarkozy and jose manuel barroso , the eu commission president on monday , just as stock markets around the world are rebounding .
the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .
britain and france not ganging up against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world have started rebounding .
" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .
the leaders ' meeting will be followed by hour-long talks with some 50 economists and business leaders including lakshmi mittal , boss of steelmaker arcelormittal , bank of england governor mervyn king and the ceo of french oil giant total , christophe de margerie . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the state needs to protect society , " said the prime minister in a live televised address .
" the emotions that followed the tragic incident can not and will not be tolerated . "
but despite the pleas , violence erupted again with many fearing it would continue unabated for days .
hundreds of students , armed with fire bombs and stones , clashed with police and smashed storefronts in the northern port city of thessaloniki on monday while gangs of youths attacked police stations and government buildings in athens .
from the northern city of veria to the central city of trikala , students battled riot police who retaliated by firing tear gas .
on crete , gangs of high school students threw chairs , wood and rocks at security forces .
authorities fear unrest could last for days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with more demonstrations planned , police fear more violence officials said they expect more demonstrations and unrest in athens as students and the greek communist party are expected to hold protests throughout the day .
with a 24-hour general strike called for wednesday , many expressed fears that the demonstrations could last for days .
confrontations between protesters and police also broke out in berlin , london and cyprus as youths occupied greek diplomatic missions .
in london , some 40 demonstrators pulled down the greek flag and raised a red and black anarchists ' banner at the greek embassy .
the widespread riots that hit greece began shortly after the fatal shooting of a teenager in the central athens ' bohemian district of exarchia on saturday .
the area , haunt of artists but also of drug addicts and petty criminals , is considered one of the city 's most violent areas .
clashes between police and youths , eager to challenge authority , occur almost nightly .
the exact circumstances are still unclear surrounding the shooting of the boy - whose age was reported in varying accounts as either 15 or 16 .
police said the shooting occurred after groups of youths began attacking a police car with stones and firebombs .
a purported warning shot by a police officer inflicted a serious stomach wound to the teenager , who died on arrival at a hospital .
police accused of " cold-blooded murder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have spread to other european cities witnesses claim that there was only a verbal exchange between the youths and police , and that the police officer shot fired into the group .
" it was cold-blooded murder , " a witness told a radio broadcaster .
despite charges of manslaughter filed against two of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting , the violence continued unabated with hundreds of students clashing with police in the northern port city of thessaloniki on monday , hurling fire bombs and stones .
officials said they expect more demonstrations and unrest in athens as students and the greek communist party are expected to hold protests throughout the day .
with a 24-hour general strike called for wednesday , many expressed fears that the demonstrations could last for days .
" more demonstrations mean more trouble , " said panagiotis likas , a shopkeeper in the tourist area of plaka .
" i do n't think i will be keeping my shop open for very long today . "

the area , haunt of artists but also of drug addicts and petty criminals , is considered one of the city 's most violent areas .
clashes between police and youths , eager to challenge authority , occur almost nightly .
the exact circumstances are still unclear surrounding the shooting of the boy - whose age was reported in varying accounts as either 15 or 16 .
police said the shooting occurred after groups of youths began attacking a police car with stones and firebombs .
a purported warning shot by a police officer inflicted a serious stomach wound to the teenager , who died on arrival at a hospital .
police accused of " cold-blooded murder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have spread to other european cities witnesses claim that there was only a verbal exchange between the youths and police , and that the police officer shot fired into the group .
" it was cold-blooded murder , " a witness told a radio broadcaster .
despite charges of manslaughter filed against two of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting , the violence continued unabated with hundreds of students clashing with police in the northern port city of thessaloniki on monday , hurling fire bombs and stones .
officials said they expect more demonstrations and unrest in athens as students and the greek communist party are expected to hold protests throughout the day .
with a 24-hour general strike called for wednesday , many expressed fears that the demonstrations could last for days .
" more demonstrations mean more trouble , " said panagiotis likas , a shopkeeper in the tourist area of plaka .
" i do n't think i will be keeping my shop open for very long today . "
the shooting of the boy hit a raw spot for thousands of greeks and youngsters , disillusioned by scandals , economic discontent and growing poverty .
news of the shooting spread like wildfire and after 24-hours of rioting the center of athens , the northern port city of thessaloniki and other cities such as patras , ioannina , hania and iraklio looked like a war zone .
greek cities turned into war-zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : businesses have been torched as the riots spread dozens of people have been injured and scores of businesses destroyed during greece 's worst rioting in decades .
the daily newspaper apogevmatini described the riots as " 48 hours of horror " on its front page while eleftheros typos headlined : " athens and thessaloniki under siege . "
entire streets and avenues remained blocked by burned and overturned vehicles , and garbage bins and teargas filled the air in areas of athens and thessaloniki .
at least 25 police were reported injured - four seriously - and 11 civilians were reported hospitalized in athens , three in patras and one in thessaloniki with injuries sustained during the riots .
the shooting has been described by the media as one of the worst incidents of police violence in more than a decade and the first time since 1985 that greek police have killed a minor .
karamanlis ' government faced a series of protests from labor groups and students in recent months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.12.2008 eu increases pakistan aid as islamabad 's crackdown continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu hopes that the increase in aid will help pakistan quell its extremist problem the eu will increase its aid to pakistan to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- over the next three years , the bloc 's external affairs commissioner said monday , dec .
8 as pakistan kept up its renewed crackdown on terrorists . the money is to be directed at boosting eu programs in the field of education , trade and farming in pakistan 's north-west , a tribal area bordering afghanistan .
" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .
aid pledge comes after insurgent attacks on us vehicles the discussions in brussels were taking place amid reports that pakistani insurgents had torched more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for us and nato forces in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : the pre-dawn attack took place on the periphery of peshawar city , where hundreds of militants on sunday raided two parking bays for nato-bound lorries and set ablaze around 150 vehicles and cargo containers , some loaded with armored humvees for the us military .
in monday 's attack , an unknown number of attackers forced their way into a truck terminal and set rows of flatbed trailers on fire , gutting the supplies loaded on them , peshawar police officer anwar zeb said . zeb said there were no reports of any casualties in the incident , the third of its kind in the area in a week . attacks on trucks hauling cargo for the western forces have recently seen a surge in peshawar , where the vehicles are parked at night before moving on to the khyber pass to cross into landlocked afghanistan . the mountain pass in the militant-infested tribal region is part of a major supply line for the international troops , who receive three-fourths of their food , fuel and military supplies through pakistan .
pakistan 's battle against extremists has become a major concern , given their use of its territory to fight nato-led troops in afghanistan , and the eu 's anti-terror coordinator gilles de kerchove is set to travel there in january .
eu looking to deepend relations with pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner said a free-trade deal will be discussed in 2009 pakistan is also pushing for a free-trade agreement with the eu .
but ferrero-waldner suggested monday that no decision would be taken by eu governments until early next year .
meanwhile , the eu is about to send a ministerial-level group of diplomats to islamabad with the aim of boosting political dialogue , officials said prior to monday 's meeting .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels on monday , were also expected to commit themselves " to intensify political dialogue and deepen relations with pakistan , " according to a draft statement prepared for the talks .
" the eu will jointly explore with the government of pakistan how to intensify dialogue in the areas of trade and development , intercultural exchange , non-proliferation , human rights , migration , counter-terrorism and radicalization and education , " added the text .
acknowledging the " complex and urgent challenges pakistan is facing " , the ministers will look to develop political dialogue through a visit soon to pakistan by a delegation including eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the possibility of " consultations taking place at the highest level " will also be considered .
islamabad 's reaction leads to mumbai suspect arrest meanwhile , pakistan arrested a senior leader of the group widely suspected of being behind the mumbai attacks , responding to intense us pressure to crack down on militants , an official said monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mumbai terrorists have been linked to pakistan zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi - who according to indian media reports was named by the lone surviving gunman as a key planner of the attacks - was detained with 14 other people during a raid on a camp in the disputed region of kashmir .
the arrests late on sunday came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice said there was evidence that pakistan had been used by " non-state actors " to mount the deadly assaults on india 's financial capital .
the 15 men arrested in pakistan-controlled kashmir were at a camp run by a charity closely linked to lashkar-e-taiba - the group at the centre of investigations into the mumbai siege , an intelligence official said .
" security forces raided a relief camp set up by jamaat-ud-dawa , " he said .
the raid was to gather information " in the wake of allegations by india that let -lrb- lashkar-e-taiba -rrb- was using pakistani territory for training , " he added .
jamaat-ud-dawa is run by hafiz saeed , who founded lashkar-e-taiba in 1989 .
he reportedly abandoned let when it was outlawed in pakistan after india alleged it was behind a 2001 attack on the indian parliament in new delhi .

" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .
aid pledge comes after insurgent attacks on us vehicles the discussions in brussels were taking place amid reports that pakistani insurgents had torched more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for us and nato forces in afghanistan .

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .

under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .

she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .
an eu climate deal would brighten prospects for a un climate deal to be agreed late next year in copenhagen . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "

then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .

" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .

this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .

the french leader , however , has remained adamant in the dispute . " this development is indeed an unwise move which not only hurts the feelings of the chinese people , but also undermines sino-french ties , " state-run xinhua news agency said of the meeting in the polish city of gdansk on saturday , dec .
6 . " the dalai lama has long been engaged in activities worldwide to split china .
he can by no means conceal the separatist nature of his activities no matter what by whatever disguise and whatever florid rhetoric he may use . " beijing did not announce any immediate action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said he 's the one who determines with whom he meets " there will be a heavy price to pay for such a malicious provocation on an issue related to china 's national unity and core interests , " said the overseas edition of the people 's daily , the communist party 's main mouthpiece . the english-language china daily warned in its lead editorial that france could expect a chinese consumer backlash . " government preference may determine the purchase of airbusus or boeings .
but it can not ... make consumers buy from brands they feel bad about , be it louis vuitton or carrefour , " it said . paris not alone in meeting dalai lama sarkozy , who had been in gdansk for ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of the nobel peace prize for lech walesa - an occasion to which the dalai lama had been invited - remained adamant about his decision to meet with the 73-year-old buddhist monk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit with the dalai lama also angered chinese authorities " the dalai lama confirmed what i already knew , that he will not demand independence for tibet , and i told him how important i thought it was to pursue dialogue between the dalai lama and chinese authorities , " sarkozy said after the meeting . " let 's not make things tense , the world does n't need it , " he added , in a veiled appeal to beijing . french media meanwhile also played down the issue , with the sunday paper journal du dimanche noting that sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac had received the dalai lama in the elysee palace in 1998 and that us president george w. bush and german chancellor angela merkel had also met with the tibetan spiritual leader . china expert jen-luc domenach commented that china 's hefty reaction could also be explained by sarkozy 's manner in which he publicly announced his aim to meet the dalai lama without prior consultation . " with regard to china , sarkozy has no clear policy approach , and china does not like this , " domenach said . dw staff -lrb- sms / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .
i am still keeping all options open , " she told bild , adding that her priority was to protect jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , in particular , prefers a diplomatic solution . eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels on monday , dec .
8 , to discuss the un request to send peacekeeping troops to dr congo .
france , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , had ruled out the deployment of european forces .
but pressure on ministers to act has increased following an appeal from un secretary-general ban ki-moon , who said europe should help reinforce un peacekeepers in the former belgian colony until more un troops can be deployed .
" it is urgent that we take a decision on such a bridging force -lrb- to dr congo -rrb- , which to my mind is absolutely necessary , " said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht .
de gucht had said earlier december that an eu peacekeeping force for dr congo would be unlikely as no one country was prepared to lead such a mission .
eu troops ready some 250,000 civilians have been displaced in the east of the dr congo since the summer as a result of renewed clashes between government forces and tutsi rebels led by renegade general laurent nkunda .
de gucht said an eu mission would need up to 3,000 heavily-armed soldiers , which would fill in immediate shortages .
finnish foreign minister alexander stubb said the eu should consider deploying its battle groups .
the eu has two such corps , each consisting of about 1,500 soldiers , on standby .
these troops are deployable at short notice anywhere in the world but have remained unused to date .
" if we do n't send them to congo , where do we send them ? "

monday 's gathering was largely designed to prepare the groundwork for this week 's eu summit of heads of state .
the situation in zimbabwe and relations with pakistan were also to be discussed .

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .

government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .

" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 08.12.2008 pakistan arrests lashkar-e-taiba militants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian allegations of pakistani involvement in the recent deadly attacks in mumbai have heightened tensions between the two rival neighbours in what appeared to be a response to international pressure , the pakistani authorities arrested about a dozen activists on monday and sealed the offices of a militant outfit formerly known as lashkar-e-taiba .
the group is accused of being involved in the recent terror attacks in the indian commercial city of mumbai .
tensions are high in india and pakistan . the string of allegations and the media hype in india since the mumbai attacks have triggered some fears of an armed conflict with pakistan .
early last week , leaders in washington and london in particular felt the need to intervene to pacify angry indians and to urge pakistan to cooperate in the investigations into the attacks .
but mutual allegations and expressions of mistrust continue to cause alarm .
special cabinet session it was against this context that pakistan 's cabinet committee on defence held an unusual session on monday , despite a public holiday .
the presence of the prime minister , the army chief and the head of the mighty inter services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- underscored the sense of urgency that the indian government 's belligerent statements have triggered in islamabad .
information minister sherry rehman told media after the meeting that pakistan was “ a responsible , democratic state , committed to safeguarding its national interest and fulfilling its international obligations . ”
she said pakistan “ rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations and recognises that actions against terrorism are integral to its core interests , ” saying pakistan would comply with the indian investigation and would do its utmost to uproot terror networks wherever they were .
islamabad under international pressure observers claim that international pressure has shaken pakistan 's fragile democratic government , which has been trying to demonstrate its readiness to take part in anti-terror investigations .
but former minister wazir jogezai said that building pressure on pakistan alone could be counterproductive .
he said it could “ strengthen the agents of destruction ” and that pressure should be applied “ with lots of care and intelligence . ”
“ it is not only a military question .
it is an intellectual and material question .
pakistan has to be helped intellectually , materially and militarily . ”
isi officers have terror links , says us the media both in pakistan and outside have running reports for days now that the us has asked for access to a few senior isi officers including one of its former heads , general hameed gul , whom they reportedly want to put on the international terror list , accusing them of having links with islamist groups .
wazir jogezai thinks this is absurd and “ nonsensical ” and that if the us wants to make such “ demands ” then the american university of nebraska “ should be taken to task ” for its involvement in changing the afghan curriculum in the late 1970s .
soon after the cia began arming the anti-soviet russian resistance in afghanistan , the university was commissioned to revise the text books for afghan children in such a way as to inject the spirit of jihad in them .
after the fall of the taliban seven years ago , the american administration again spent several million dollars to revise afghan school text books .
many pakistanis hold the united states equally responsible for the conditions that afghanistan and pakistan find themselves itself in today . imtiaz gul -lrb- islamabad -rrb- 08/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 wikileaks pakistan has criticized the release of secret us diplomatic documents by wikileaks .

at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .

leagues without a break , such as the english premiership , have long looked to germany with envious glances as its teams toil away through a cold and busy winter schedule . the winter break has also been cited as one of the reasons for the german national team doing so well in international competitions , as its players are fresher by the time the big summer tournaments come around . however , contrary to this belief , the dfb said the intended reduction of the break will allow the national team to prepare in better conditions for the 2010 world cup in south africa , should it qualify .
the thinking behind this is that the season will end sooner , giving the players more of a break before the world cup begins in june 2010 . soccer organizations see world cup benefits the opening round of matches of the 2009-10 season will be held between aug .
7-10 with the 34th and final round of matches coming on may 8 , 2010 .
the winter break will be between dec .
21 and jan .
15 . " the compromise found by the federation and the german league is absolutely positive for preparations for the 2010 world cup , " federation secretary-general wolfgang niersbach said . german league chief holger hieronymus also welcomed the move , for different reasons . " our championship has the longest break in europe , " he said .
" we need to have more weekend games because those played in midweek are n't interesting enough for the clubs from a financial point of view , or for the fans .

two officers involved in the shooting were arrested on sunday . according to greek television reports , almost all of the 150 hooded youths who had sought shelter inside the polytechnic university , which is off-limits to police under greek law , had left the building .
at least 40 people were injured in the riots , which raged since saturday .
the unrest left athens and the northern port city of thessaloniki resembling war zones as self-styled anarchists torched cars , banks , police precincts , car dealerships , government buildings , private homes and stores and erected barricades that were set ablaze .
the riots broke out across greece after police shot and killed a boy , whose age was reported as either 15 or 16 , in clashes with youths in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and rioters battled through the night in thessaloniki the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting of the teenager are still unclear .
police said the shooting occurred after groups of youths began attacking a police car with stones and firebombs .
a purported warning shot by a police officer inflicted a serious stomach wound to the teenager , who died on arrival at a hospital .
witnesses claim that there was only a verbal exchange between the youths and police , and that the police officer fired into the group .
despite charges of manslaughter filed against two of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting , the violence continued unabated until the early hours of monday .
inquiry underway interior minister prokopis pavlopoulos offered his resignation to the country 's prime minister , but the offer was rejected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .
i am still keeping all options open , " she told bild , adding that her priority was to protect jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wolfsburg are now sixth , four points behind martin jol 's men .
croatian international petric opened the scoring for hamburg on the quarter-hour mark , heading home marcell jansen 's cross at the far post to make it 2-0 after 31 minutes as cologne failed to adequately deal with a hamburg corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the loss , daum 's cologne are still in mid-table milivoje novakovic pulled one back for cologne seven minutes from time , striking a well-placed shot from 11 meters for his 10th goal of the season , but hamburg held on for the win .
cologne have now lost four games in a row but are still safe in mid-table , seven points above the relegation zone .
zvjezdan misimovic was the hero for wolfsburg , scoring from a free-kick on 63 minutes , just four minutes after hanover 's jiri stajner had cancelled out cristian zaccardo 's first-half opener , which was beautifully set up by misimovic .
hanover were reduced to 10 men on 80 minutes when goalkeeper florian fromlowitz saw a straight red for a professional foul on edin dzeko .
with hanover having used all their substitutes , midfielder jan rosenthal was forced to go into goal and , incredibly , he saved dzeko 's subsequent spot kick .
saturday action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan kiessling hit two goals against moenchengladbach as bayer went third bayer leverkusen regrouped after a couple of defeats to win 3-1 at borussia moenchengladbach on saturday to keep in touch with bundesliga leaders tsg hoffenheim and bayern munich .
stefan kiessling struck twice and fed patrick helmes for the other for leverkusen , who are unbeaten against moenchengladbach in 23 matches since the last defeat in 1994 .
leverkusen have 31 points , moving into third place ahead of hertha berlin , who remain on 30 after losing 1-0 at beleaguered schalke 04 , and hamburg , who also have 30 points but sit one behind hertha on goal difference .
hoffenheim and munich lead the way with 34 points each after munich won their classy table-topper 2-1 from luca toni 's injury time goal on friday night .
promoted hoffenheim remain top thanks to a superior goal difference .
leverkusen topped the table just three weeks ago but then suffered a 2-1 loss at lowly arminia bielefeld and a 2-0 home defeat against munich .
they rebounded on saturday with kiessling opening the scoring on a solo effort in the 15th minute .
the forward got his second goal 12 minutes later on the counter and then played a neat one-two with helmes in the 54th with helmes firing home a low shot for a 3-0 lead .
moenchengladbach managed no more than a consolation goal from teenager toni jantschke as they plunged to the bottom of the table .

the group is accused of being involved in the recent terror attacks in the indian commercial city of mumbai .
tensions are high in india and pakistan . the string of allegations and the media hype in india since the mumbai attacks have triggered some fears of an armed conflict with pakistan .
early last week , leaders in washington and london in particular felt the need to intervene to pacify angry indians and to urge pakistan to cooperate in the investigations into the attacks .
but mutual allegations and expressions of mistrust continue to cause alarm .
special cabinet session it was against this context that pakistan 's cabinet committee on defence held an unusual session on monday , despite a public holiday .
the presence of the prime minister , the army chief and the head of the mighty inter services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- underscored the sense of urgency that the indian government 's belligerent statements have triggered in islamabad .
information minister sherry rehman told media after the meeting that pakistan was “ a responsible , democratic state , committed to safeguarding its national interest and fulfilling its international obligations . ”
she said pakistan “ rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations and recognises that actions against terrorism are integral to its core interests , ” saying pakistan would comply with the indian investigation and would do its utmost to uproot terror networks wherever they were .
islamabad under international pressure observers claim that international pressure has shaken pakistan 's fragile democratic government , which has been trying to demonstrate its readiness to take part in anti-terror investigations .

the group is accused of being involved in the recent terror attacks in the indian commercial city of mumbai .
tensions are high in india and pakistan . the string of allegations and the media hype in india since the mumbai attacks have triggered some fears of an armed conflict with pakistan .
early last week , leaders in washington and london in particular felt the need to intervene to pacify angry indians and to urge pakistan to cooperate in the investigations into the attacks .
but mutual allegations and expressions of mistrust continue to cause alarm .
special cabinet session it was against this context that pakistan 's cabinet committee on defence held an unusual session on monday , despite a public holiday .
the presence of the prime minister , the army chief and the head of the mighty inter services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- underscored the sense of urgency that the indian government 's belligerent statements have triggered in islamabad .
information minister sherry rehman told media after the meeting that pakistan was “ a responsible , democratic state , committed to safeguarding its national interest and fulfilling its international obligations . ”
she said pakistan “ rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations and recognises that actions against terrorism are integral to its core interests , ” saying pakistan would comply with the indian investigation and would do its utmost to uproot terror networks wherever they were .
islamabad under international pressure observers claim that international pressure has shaken pakistan 's fragile democratic government , which has been trying to demonstrate its readiness to take part in anti-terror investigations .
but former minister wazir jogezai said that building pressure on pakistan alone could be counterproductive .
he said it could “ strengthen the agents of destruction ” and that pressure should be applied “ with lots of care and intelligence . ”
“ it is not only a military question .
it is an intellectual and material question .
pakistan has to be helped intellectually , materially and militarily . ”
isi officers have terror links , says us the media both in pakistan and outside have running reports for days now that the us has asked for access to a few senior isi officers including one of its former heads , general hameed gul , whom they reportedly want to put on the international terror list , accusing them of having links with islamist groups .
wazir jogezai thinks this is absurd and “ nonsensical ” and that if the us wants to make such “ demands ” then the american university of nebraska “ should be taken to task ” for its involvement in changing the afghan curriculum in the late 1970s .
soon after the cia began arming the anti-soviet russian resistance in afghanistan , the university was commissioned to revise the text books for afghan children in such a way as to inject the spirit of jihad in them .
after the fall of the taliban seven years ago , the american administration again spent several million dollars to revise afghan school text books .

the group is accused of being involved in the recent terror attacks in the indian commercial city of mumbai .
tensions are high in india and pakistan . the string of allegations and the media hype in india since the mumbai attacks have triggered some fears of an armed conflict with pakistan .
early last week , leaders in washington and london in particular felt the need to intervene to pacify angry indians and to urge pakistan to cooperate in the investigations into the attacks .
but mutual allegations and expressions of mistrust continue to cause alarm .
special cabinet session it was against this context that pakistan 's cabinet committee on defence held an unusual session on monday , despite a public holiday .
the presence of the prime minister , the army chief and the head of the mighty inter services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- underscored the sense of urgency that the indian government 's belligerent statements have triggered in islamabad .

she said pakistan “ rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations and recognises that actions against terrorism are integral to its core interests , ” saying pakistan would comply with the indian investigation and would do its utmost to uproot terror networks wherever they were .

the group is accused of being involved in the recent terror attacks in the indian commercial city of mumbai .
tensions are high in india and pakistan . the string of allegations and the media hype in india since the mumbai attacks have triggered some fears of an armed conflict with pakistan .
early last week , leaders in washington and london in particular felt the need to intervene to pacify angry indians and to urge pakistan to cooperate in the investigations into the attacks .
but mutual allegations and expressions of mistrust continue to cause alarm .
special cabinet session it was against this context that pakistan 's cabinet committee on defence held an unusual session on monday , despite a public holiday .
the presence of the prime minister , the army chief and the head of the mighty inter services intelligence -lrb- isi -rrb- underscored the sense of urgency that the indian government 's belligerent statements have triggered in islamabad .
information minister sherry rehman told media after the meeting that pakistan was “ a responsible , democratic state , committed to safeguarding its national interest and fulfilling its international obligations . ”
she said pakistan “ rejects terrorism in all forms and manifestations and recognises that actions against terrorism are integral to its core interests , ” saying pakistan would comply with the indian investigation and would do its utmost to uproot terror networks wherever they were .
islamabad under international pressure observers claim that international pressure has shaken pakistan 's fragile democratic government , which has been trying to demonstrate its readiness to take part in anti-terror investigations .
but former minister wazir jogezai said that building pressure on pakistan alone could be counterproductive .
he said it could “ strengthen the agents of destruction ” and that pressure should be applied “ with lots of care and intelligence . ”
“ it is not only a military question .
it is an intellectual and material question .
pakistan has to be helped intellectually , materially and militarily . ”
isi officers have terror links , says us the media both in pakistan and outside have running reports for days now that the us has asked for access to a few senior isi officers including one of its former heads , general hameed gul , whom they reportedly want to put on the international terror list , accusing them of having links with islamist groups .
wazir jogezai thinks this is absurd and “ nonsensical ” and that if the us wants to make such “ demands ” then the american university of nebraska “ should be taken to task ” for its involvement in changing the afghan curriculum in the late 1970s .
soon after the cia began arming the anti-soviet russian resistance in afghanistan , the university was commissioned to revise the text books for afghan children in such a way as to inject the spirit of jihad in them .
after the fall of the taliban seven years ago , the american administration again spent several million dollars to revise afghan school text books .
many pakistanis hold the united states equally responsible for the conditions that afghanistan and pakistan find themselves itself in today . imtiaz gul -lrb- islamabad -rrb- 08/12/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 environment the next round of global climate change talks kicks off in cancun at the end of the month .

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "

wolfsburg are now sixth , four points behind martin jol 's men .
croatian international petric opened the scoring for hamburg on the quarter-hour mark , heading home marcell jansen 's cross at the far post to make it 2-0 after 31 minutes as cologne failed to adequately deal with a hamburg corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the loss , daum 's cologne are still in mid-table milivoje novakovic pulled one back for cologne seven minutes from time , striking a well-placed shot from 11 meters for his 10th goal of the season , but hamburg held on for the win .
cologne have now lost four games in a row but are still safe in mid-table , seven points above the relegation zone .
zvjezdan misimovic was the hero for wolfsburg , scoring from a free-kick on 63 minutes , just four minutes after hanover 's jiri stajner had cancelled out cristian zaccardo 's first-half opener , which was beautifully set up by misimovic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .
i am still keeping all options open , " she told bild , adding that her priority was to protect jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 as pakistan kept up its renewed crackdown on terrorists . the money is to be directed at boosting eu programs in the field of education , trade and farming in pakistan 's north-west , a tribal area bordering afghanistan .
" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .
aid pledge comes after insurgent attacks on us vehicles the discussions in brussels were taking place amid reports that pakistani insurgents had torched more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for us and nato forces in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : the pre-dawn attack took place on the periphery of peshawar city , where hundreds of militants on sunday raided two parking bays for nato-bound lorries and set ablaze around 150 vehicles and cargo containers , some loaded with armored humvees for the us military .
in monday 's attack , an unknown number of attackers forced their way into a truck terminal and set rows of flatbed trailers on fire , gutting the supplies loaded on them , peshawar police officer anwar zeb said . zeb said there were no reports of any casualties in the incident , the third of its kind in the area in a week . attacks on trucks hauling cargo for the western forces have recently seen a surge in peshawar , where the vehicles are parked at night before moving on to the khyber pass to cross into landlocked afghanistan . the mountain pass in the militant-infested tribal region is part of a major supply line for the international troops , who receive three-fourths of their food , fuel and military supplies through pakistan .
pakistan 's battle against extremists has become a major concern , given their use of its territory to fight nato-led troops in afghanistan , and the eu 's anti-terror coordinator gilles de kerchove is set to travel there in january .

" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .

8 as pakistan kept up its renewed crackdown on terrorists . the money is to be directed at boosting eu programs in the field of education , trade and farming in pakistan 's north-west , a tribal area bordering afghanistan .
" the border area is very important , " ferrero-waldner said , noting that educational programs were particularly important in a destitute part of the country that is also a breeding-ground for terrorists .
the eu has already supported pakistan to the tune of about 500 million euros since 1976 , and the commissioner conceded monday that fighting corruption and guaranteeing security would be needed to ensure that any fresh money is well spent .
strengthening pakistan 's democratic institutions and helping it crack down on terrorism " is also in india 's interest " , she said .
the commissioner also praised pakistan 's raid on a suspected militant camp , which has led to the arrest of the alleged planner of the november 26 mumbai terrorist attacks , describing pakistan 's move as " courageous " .
her comments came as eu foreign ministers were meeting in brussels to discuss ways of enhancing the bloc 's ties with pakistan following the end of emergency rule by ex-president pervez musharraf and its slow return to full democracy .
ministers were also expected to call for closer cooperation in the fight against terrorism , both within pakistan and over its borders in afghanistan and india .
aid pledge comes after insurgent attacks on us vehicles the discussions in brussels were taking place amid reports that pakistani insurgents had torched more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for us and nato forces in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : the pre-dawn attack took place on the periphery of peshawar city , where hundreds of militants on sunday raided two parking bays for nato-bound lorries and set ablaze around 150 vehicles and cargo containers , some loaded with armored humvees for the us military .
in monday 's attack , an unknown number of attackers forced their way into a truck terminal and set rows of flatbed trailers on fire , gutting the supplies loaded on them , peshawar police officer anwar zeb said . zeb said there were no reports of any casualties in the incident , the third of its kind in the area in a week . attacks on trucks hauling cargo for the western forces have recently seen a surge in peshawar , where the vehicles are parked at night before moving on to the khyber pass to cross into landlocked afghanistan . the mountain pass in the militant-infested tribal region is part of a major supply line for the international troops , who receive three-fourths of their food , fuel and military supplies through pakistan .
pakistan 's battle against extremists has become a major concern , given their use of its territory to fight nato-led troops in afghanistan , and the eu 's anti-terror coordinator gilles de kerchove is set to travel there in january .
eu looking to deepend relations with pakistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrero-waldner said a free-trade deal will be discussed in 2009 pakistan is also pushing for a free-trade agreement with the eu .
but ferrero-waldner suggested monday that no decision would be taken by eu governments until early next year .
meanwhile , the eu is about to send a ministerial-level group of diplomats to islamabad with the aim of boosting political dialogue , officials said prior to monday 's meeting .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels on monday , were also expected to commit themselves " to intensify political dialogue and deepen relations with pakistan , " according to a draft statement prepared for the talks .
" the eu will jointly explore with the government of pakistan how to intensify dialogue in the areas of trade and development , intercultural exchange , non-proliferation , human rights , migration , counter-terrorism and radicalization and education , " added the text .
acknowledging the " complex and urgent challenges pakistan is facing " , the ministers will look to develop political dialogue through a visit soon to pakistan by a delegation including eu foreign policy chief javier solana .
the possibility of " consultations taking place at the highest level " will also be considered .
islamabad 's reaction leads to mumbai suspect arrest meanwhile , pakistan arrested a senior leader of the group widely suspected of being behind the mumbai attacks , responding to intense us pressure to crack down on militants , an official said monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mumbai terrorists have been linked to pakistan zaki-ur-rehman lakhvi - who according to indian media reports was named by the lone surviving gunman as a key planner of the attacks - was detained with 14 other people during a raid on a camp in the disputed region of kashmir .
the arrests late on sunday came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice said there was evidence that pakistan had been used by " non-state actors " to mount the deadly assaults on india 's financial capital .
the 15 men arrested in pakistan-controlled kashmir were at a camp run by a charity closely linked to lashkar-e-taiba - the group at the centre of investigations into the mumbai siege , an intelligence official said .
" security forces raided a relief camp set up by jamaat-ud-dawa , " he said .
the raid was to gather information " in the wake of allegations by india that let -lrb- lashkar-e-taiba -rrb- was using pakistani territory for training , " he added .
jamaat-ud-dawa is run by hafiz saeed , who founded lashkar-e-taiba in 1989 .
he reportedly abandoned let when it was outlawed in pakistan after india alleged it was behind a 2001 attack on the indian parliament in new delhi .
lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- " army of the pious " -rrb- was established to fight indian rule in kashmir and has past links to both pakistani intelligence services and al qaeda . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .
i am still keeping all options open , " she told bild , adding that her priority was to protect jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic faces charges of genocide whether the same will happen at the yugoslavia tribunal with war crimes suspect radovan karadzic remains to be seen .
former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic died in prison before he could be sentenced , and karadzic 's wartime military leader , ratko mladic , still remains at large .
then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : human rights declaration honored on 60th anniversary after six decades , human rights remain a work in progress holocaust survivor still fights for human rights crime -pipe- 08.12.2008 60 years on , genocide convention still prompts debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the genocide in rwanda set legal precedents with life sentences for many perpetrators sixty years ago , the un adopted the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide .
this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic faces charges of genocide whether the same will happen at the yugoslavia tribunal with war crimes suspect radovan karadzic remains to be seen .
former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic died in prison before he could be sentenced , and karadzic 's wartime military leader , ratko mladic , still remains at large .
then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .
just because jurisprudence has to be created and the world is waiting for verdicts is no reason to start revising this definition . "
not a word to be used lightly another topic for discussion at the conference was misuse of the word " genocide . "
the prominent indictments against karadzic and el bashir have had the effect of popularizing the term , to the extent that it 's now even being used by animal activists describing the suffering of animals .
politicians also more frequently use the term in order to justify violence and military engagement .
" the bloody conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example , " said ten have .
" both sides deliberately spoke of genocide , even though in this case , it really was n't applicable .
we have to keep the term pure - both legally and politically speaking .
and we have to accept that it should n't be used lightly . " kerstin schweighöfer -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .
britain and france not ganging up against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world have started rebounding .
" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .

" wilders told dutch daily newspaper spits he was travelling abroad to create international " alliances for peace and against islamization . "
wilders , leader of the dutch freedom party pvv , is one of the most outspoken critics of islam in the netherlands .
he has received numerous death threats and has taken to keeping personal security guards .
he has received support from right-wing organizations such as the us thinktank american freedom alliance , which awarded him its so-called freedom award .
" fitna " is a 16-minute mini-film broadcast on the internet .

on monday , she vowed to fight any eu climate deal that could jeopardize german jobs .
speaking ahead of a european union summit starting thursday in brussels , merkel told the top-selling bild newspaper : " it must not take decisions that would endanger jobs or investments in germany . "
" i will make sure of that , " she added .
during her presidencies last year of both the eu and the g8 , merkel was sharpening her profile as the " climate chancellor . "
she traveled to greenland to draw attention to melting ice floes and promised that europe would lead the way on climate issues by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 -lrb- compared to 1990 levels . -rrb-
now , though , the financial crisis and domestic worries are causing her to revise her message .
according to an unpublished report by the economy ministry , germany risks losing more than 100,000 jobs if the eu were to force industries to pay for pollution rights that are currently free .
another study by the muenster-based eefa research institute pointed to increased costs stemming from reforming pollution rights , making germany 's key industrial sector less competitive and threatening up to 300,000 jobs by 2020 .
environment activists outraged representatives from germany 's strong environmental lobby said they were " horrified " by the chancellor 's apparent u-turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wants emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry " last year , the chancellor put herself about as the climate chancellor , now she 's fighting to ensure that german industry keeps rights to pollute for free , " oxfam germany 's spokesman jan kowalzig said in a statement monday .
under the eu climate deal , companies would in future have to purchase rights to pollute .
and while berlin wants most emissions allowances to be free for heavy industry , the eu plans would see the percentage auctioned off gradually increased up to 100 percent in 2020 , when every ton of co2 will have to be bought .
french president nicolas sarkozy is hoping to clinch a deal on climate change before france 's eu presidency ends on january 1 .
most of the resistance comes from former east bloc countries , many of which rely on heavily-polluting coal-fired plants for energy .
sarkozy said there ahd been progress during talks on saturday with leaders meeting in the polish city of gdansk .
" we are not at the end of the discussion , but we have progressed , " he said .

the french leader , however , has remained adamant in the dispute . " this development is indeed an unwise move which not only hurts the feelings of the chinese people , but also undermines sino-french ties , " state-run xinhua news agency said of the meeting in the polish city of gdansk on saturday , dec .
6 . " the dalai lama has long been engaged in activities worldwide to split china .
he can by no means conceal the separatist nature of his activities no matter what by whatever disguise and whatever florid rhetoric he may use . " beijing did not announce any immediate action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said he 's the one who determines with whom he meets " there will be a heavy price to pay for such a malicious provocation on an issue related to china 's national unity and core interests , " said the overseas edition of the people 's daily , the communist party 's main mouthpiece . the english-language china daily warned in its lead editorial that france could expect a chinese consumer backlash . " government preference may determine the purchase of airbusus or boeings .
but it can not ... make consumers buy from brands they feel bad about , be it louis vuitton or carrefour , " it said . paris not alone in meeting dalai lama sarkozy , who had been in gdansk for ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of the nobel peace prize for lech walesa - an occasion to which the dalai lama had been invited - remained adamant about his decision to meet with the 73-year-old buddhist monk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit with the dalai lama also angered chinese authorities " the dalai lama confirmed what i already knew , that he will not demand independence for tibet , and i told him how important i thought it was to pursue dialogue between the dalai lama and chinese authorities , " sarkozy said after the meeting . " let 's not make things tense , the world does n't need it , " he added , in a veiled appeal to beijing . french media meanwhile also played down the issue , with the sunday paper journal du dimanche noting that sarkozy 's predecessor jacques chirac had received the dalai lama in the elysee palace in 1998 and that us president george w. bush and german chancellor angela merkel had also met with the tibetan spiritual leader . china expert jen-luc domenach commented that china 's hefty reaction could also be explained by sarkozy 's manner in which he publicly announced his aim to meet the dalai lama without prior consultation .

two officers involved in the shooting were arrested on sunday . according to greek television reports , almost all of the 150 hooded youths who had sought shelter inside the polytechnic university , which is off-limits to police under greek law , had left the building .
at least 40 people were injured in the riots , which raged since saturday .
the unrest left athens and the northern port city of thessaloniki resembling war zones as self-styled anarchists torched cars , banks , police precincts , car dealerships , government buildings , private homes and stores and erected barricades that were set ablaze .
the riots broke out across greece after police shot and killed a boy , whose age was reported as either 15 or 16 , in clashes with youths in athens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and rioters battled through the night in thessaloniki the exact circumstances surrounding the shooting of the teenager are still unclear .
police said the shooting occurred after groups of youths began attacking a police car with stones and firebombs .
a purported warning shot by a police officer inflicted a serious stomach wound to the teenager , who died on arrival at a hospital .
witnesses claim that there was only a verbal exchange between the youths and police , and that the police officer fired into the group .
despite charges of manslaughter filed against two of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting , the violence continued unabated until the early hours of monday .
inquiry underway interior minister prokopis pavlopoulos offered his resignation to the country 's prime minister , but the offer was rejected .
" i express my sorrow for the incident of the death of the young boy , " he said . pavlopoulos said sunday anyone found responsible would face " exemplary punishment , " and added that while people have the right to demonstrate , protests should not turn against " people who are not to blame for anything .

" the state needs to protect society , " said the prime minister in a live televised address .
" the emotions that followed the tragic incident can not and will not be tolerated . "
but despite the pleas , violence erupted again with many fearing it would continue unabated for days .
hundreds of students , armed with fire bombs and stones , clashed with police and smashed storefronts in the northern port city of thessaloniki on monday while gangs of youths attacked police stations and government buildings in athens .
from the northern city of veria to the central city of trikala , students battled riot police who retaliated by firing tear gas .
on crete , gangs of high school students threw chairs , wood and rocks at security forces .
authorities fear unrest could last for days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with more demonstrations planned , police fear more violence officials said they expect more demonstrations and unrest in athens as students and the greek communist party are expected to hold protests throughout the day .
with a 24-hour general strike called for wednesday , many expressed fears that the demonstrations could last for days .
confrontations between protesters and police also broke out in berlin , london and cyprus as youths occupied greek diplomatic missions .
in london , some 40 demonstrators pulled down the greek flag and raised a red and black anarchists ' banner at the greek embassy .
the widespread riots that hit greece began shortly after the fatal shooting of a teenager in the central athens ' bohemian district of exarchia on saturday .
the area , haunt of artists but also of drug addicts and petty criminals , is considered one of the city 's most violent areas .
clashes between police and youths , eager to challenge authority , occur almost nightly .
the exact circumstances are still unclear surrounding the shooting of the boy - whose age was reported in varying accounts as either 15 or 16 .
police said the shooting occurred after groups of youths began attacking a police car with stones and firebombs .
a purported warning shot by a police officer inflicted a serious stomach wound to the teenager , who died on arrival at a hospital .
police accused of " cold-blooded murder " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have spread to other european cities witnesses claim that there was only a verbal exchange between the youths and police , and that the police officer shot fired into the group .
" it was cold-blooded murder , " a witness told a radio broadcaster .
despite charges of manslaughter filed against two of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting , the violence continued unabated with hundreds of students clashing with police in the northern port city of thessaloniki on monday , hurling fire bombs and stones .
officials said they expect more demonstrations and unrest in athens as students and the greek communist party are expected to hold protests throughout the day .
with a 24-hour general strike called for wednesday , many expressed fears that the demonstrations could last for days .
" more demonstrations mean more trouble , " said panagiotis likas , a shopkeeper in the tourist area of plaka .
" i do n't think i will be keeping my shop open for very long today . "
the shooting of the boy hit a raw spot for thousands of greeks and youngsters , disillusioned by scandals , economic discontent and growing poverty .
news of the shooting spread like wildfire and after 24-hours of rioting the center of athens , the northern port city of thessaloniki and other cities such as patras , ioannina , hania and iraklio looked like a war zone .
greek cities turned into war-zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : businesses have been torched as the riots spread dozens of people have been injured and scores of businesses destroyed during greece 's worst rioting in decades .
the daily newspaper apogevmatini described the riots as " 48 hours of horror " on its front page while eleftheros typos headlined : " athens and thessaloniki under siege . "
entire streets and avenues remained blocked by burned and overturned vehicles , and garbage bins and teargas filled the air in areas of athens and thessaloniki .
at least 25 police were reported injured - four seriously - and 11 civilians were reported hospitalized in athens , three in patras and one in thessaloniki with injuries sustained during the riots .
the shooting has been described by the media as one of the worst incidents of police violence in more than a decade and the first time since 1985 that greek police have killed a minor .
karamanlis ' government faced a series of protests from labor groups and students in recent months .
reports said that karamanlis , whose government rules with a slim majority , may be forced to call early elections .
public unrest has grown with the conservative government 's austerity measures , with unions regularly demonstrating against privatizations , pension reforms and the cost of living .
one-fifth of greeks live below the poverty line .
" this was bound to happen .
the government and police believe they are invincible and that they public should put up with its scandals and brutality , " said 45-year-old housewife angeliki papadopoulou , summing up a widely-held view .
university professors meanwhile began a three-day walkout on monday and tens of thousands of students refused anyway to attend classes , in protest . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

stansted , which is some 50 kilometers -lrb- 30 miles -rrb- north-east of london , is the region 's third-biggest airport after gatwick and heathrow and used mainly by budget airlines , including ryanair , for their european routes .

" we 're here because our parents ' generation has failed us and its now down to young people to stop climate change by whatever peaceful means we have left , " a statement posted on the group 's web site said .
" being arrested is a terrifying prospect , but not nearly as terrifying as the threat of climate change , " one female protestor told the bbc monday .

" the moment has arrived to put on the pressure for mugabe to step down and give the opportunity once again to the people of zimbabwe to get their life together and begin to move the country forward , " solana told reporters as he arrived for talks with eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
" the important thing is the political pressure now , " he said .

black diamonds also on monday , dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen urged the eu to investigate ways to put a stop to zimbabwe 's illegal diamond trade .
" people are being tortured , a human rights activist has disappeared without any trace and the government blocks aid for people suffering from hunger and cholera , " he said .

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .
britain and france not ganging up against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world have started rebounding .
" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .
the leaders ' meeting will be followed by hour-long talks with some 50 economists and business leaders including lakshmi mittal , boss of steelmaker arcelormittal , bank of england governor mervyn king and the ceo of french oil giant total , christophe de margerie . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .
britain and france not ganging up against germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stock markets around the world have started rebounding .
" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-german relations are more about practicality than love merkel is keen for germany to retain more fiscal flexibility and prefers a more prudent wait and see approach before us president-elect barack obama takes office on january 20 . berlin has also expressed doubts about last week 's interest rate cuts by the european central bank , which merkel says goes too far .
the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .
aim of summit to give coherence to european rescue plans the london talks are due to start mid-afternoon and will focus on measures to revive the economy , according to a french source close to sarkozy .
" it 's a chance to evaluate the situation to see where we are in europe , " the source told the french news agency afp .
the aim is to " give coherence " to different european rescue plans " so that a message of confidence can be put forward by the european council on the 11 and 12 " december , he added .
the leaders ' meeting will be followed by hour-long talks with some 50 economists and business leaders including lakshmi mittal , boss of steelmaker arcelormittal , bank of england governor mervyn king and the ceo of french oil giant total , christophe de margerie . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the summit is notable for the absence of german chancellor angela merkel , who heads europe 's biggest economy .
the german government however denied reports that merkel was not invited to london , after media reports surfaced saying that her european counterparts were distancing themselves from her .
brown , sarkozy and barroso favour a joint eu stimulus package to lift the economy across the continent , whereas merkel is not so enthusiastic about a european-wide plan and is perceived as going the unilateral german way .

" because it is a bilateral meeting , we never expected that the chancellor would take part , " said spokesman thomas steg .
over the past week or so , london and paris each unveiled stimulus packages in the order of 25 billion euros and are keen for germany to do more to boost its economy than current measures to inject liquidity with 12 billion euros in fresh money into the system .
government sources in berlin have said that sarkozy 's plan is similar to germany 's in terms of content , but that britain is different due to the dominance of its financial sector and an economy that is more consumption-oriented .
even british and french officials downplayed the symbolic significance of the meeting and insisted that sarkozy and brown were not ganging up against merkel ahead of a summit that includes all eu leaders on thursday .
however when the french president unveiled his country 's stimulus plan last week , sarkozy had said that france kept to its promises made at the g20 emergency summit in washington last month and plans to stimulate the economies of the us , china , the eu , uk , italy and spain .
he had noticeably left out germany from his list . no love lost between sarkozy and merkel even though sarkozy and merkel both hail from centre-right parties in their respective governments , the personal chemistry between the two leaders has been cordial at best .

the german and french economies form the backbone of the european currency , whereas britain still retains the pound .

this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic faces charges of genocide whether the same will happen at the yugoslavia tribunal with war crimes suspect radovan karadzic remains to be seen .
former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic died in prison before he could be sentenced , and karadzic 's wartime military leader , ratko mladic , still remains at large .
then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .
just because jurisprudence has to be created and the world is waiting for verdicts is no reason to start revising this definition . "
not a word to be used lightly another topic for discussion at the conference was misuse of the word " genocide . "
the prominent indictments against karadzic and el bashir have had the effect of popularizing the term , to the extent that it 's now even being used by animal activists describing the suffering of animals .
politicians also more frequently use the term in order to justify violence and military engagement .
" the bloody conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example , " said ten have .
" both sides deliberately spoke of genocide , even though in this case , it really was n't applicable .
we have to keep the term pure - both legally and politically speaking .

this week , historians , lawyers and politicians discussed the convention 's future at a conference in the hague . why is it that a massacre , as horrific as it may be , is not considered genocide ?
at what point can we begin using the word genocide to describe the worst crime committed human beings can perpetrate on each other ?
these were the types of questions being posed at a conference in the hague on monday to mark 60 years since the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 260 , better known as the convention on genocide . among the guest speakers was chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno ocampo .
and it 's no coincidence that the conference is being held in the hague , which , due to its many international courts , has developed into the " legal capital of the world , " former un general secretary , boutros gali , once said .
among the program points was a discussion about the definition of genocide as it was laid down in the un convention on december 9 , 1948 .
the most important criterion is the intention to completely obliterate an entire race .
that 's why genocide does n't always involve massacres - a single murder will do .
even if all the women of a certain population are to be made infertile , or all the children are to be kidnapped , it can still be genocide if the purpose is to wipe out that population .
it 's the most decisive criterion , and for the prosecutors , the hardest to prove .
the polish-jewish lawyer raphael lemkin - a pioneer in the field of international justice - coined the term genocide .
he was responding to the mass murder of armenians at the hands of the turks in 1915 - a massacre that even today , is not legally classified as genocide .
this also applies to the holocaust .
it was never explicitly defined as genocide before a court , and not a single defendant has ever been found guilty of genocide towards the jews .
the usual verdict was " crimes against humanity . "
rwanda , yugoslavia set legal precedents only in the last 15 years have courts ever found defendants guilty of genocide , in two cases - rwanda and the former yugoslavia .
in the judges ' opinions , the mass murder of the tutsis and the murder of thousands of muslim men and boys in srebrenica were clear cases of genocide .
at the rwanda tribunal , a large number of political leaders were given life sentences in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic faces charges of genocide whether the same will happen at the yugoslavia tribunal with war crimes suspect radovan karadzic remains to be seen .
former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic died in prison before he could be sentenced , and karadzic 's wartime military leader , ratko mladic , still remains at large .
then there 's the new international criminal court , the icc .
last summer , chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo indicted sundanese president omar el bashir on charges of genocide in darfur .
because of the small number of convictions , recently , the voices of those who would loosen the criteria for genocide have been growing louder .
it 's a subject that was up for debate at the conference in the hague , but for dutch historian and director of the amsterdam center for holocaust and genocide studies , wichert ten have , it 's out of the question .
" i do n't think this is the right way to go , " he said .
" it was hard enough to get all the countries to accept the current definition 60 years ago .
just because jurisprudence has to be created and the world is waiting for verdicts is no reason to start revising this definition . "
not a word to be used lightly another topic for discussion at the conference was misuse of the word " genocide . "
the prominent indictments against karadzic and el bashir have had the effect of popularizing the term , to the extent that it 's now even being used by animal activists describing the suffering of animals .
politicians also more frequently use the term in order to justify violence and military engagement .
" the bloody conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example , " said ten have .
" both sides deliberately spoke of genocide , even though in this case , it really was n't applicable .
we have to keep the term pure - both legally and politically speaking .
and we have to accept that it should n't be used lightly . " kerstin schweighöfer -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leagues without a break , such as the english premiership , have long looked to germany with envious glances as its teams toil away through a cold and busy winter schedule . the winter break has also been cited as one of the reasons for the german national team doing so well in international competitions , as its players are fresher by the time the big summer tournaments come around . however , contrary to this belief , the dfb said the intended reduction of the break will allow the national team to prepare in better conditions for the 2010 world cup in south africa , should it qualify .
the thinking behind this is that the season will end sooner , giving the players more of a break before the world cup begins in june 2010 . soccer organizations see world cup benefits the opening round of matches of the 2009-10 season will be held between aug .
7-10 with the 34th and final round of matches coming on may 8 , 2010 .
the winter break will be between dec .
21 and jan .
15 . " the compromise found by the federation and the german league is absolutely positive for preparations for the 2010 world cup , " federation secretary-general wolfgang niersbach said . german league chief holger hieronymus also welcomed the move , for different reasons . " our championship has the longest break in europe , " he said .
" we need to have more weekend games because those played in midweek are n't interesting enough for the clubs from a financial point of view , or for the fans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.12.2008 german business leaders pressure merkel for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely to be a merry christmas for the chancellor as the economic pressure builds with germany in recession , a growing chorus is ditching the christmas carols , raising their voices instead to urge chancellor angela merkel to do more to help boost europe 's biggest economy . merkel came under pressure over the weekend from german business leaders and senior politicians who called for her to introduce a fresh set of measures to stimulate the economy .
at the same time , the leftist wing of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- reiterated its support for the proposed free shopping vouchers , where consumers would receive coupons - most advocates suggest 500 euros -lrb- $ 636 -rrb- - which they could trade in for goods and services despite the 31-billion-euro -lrb- $ 39-billion -rrb- stimulus package pushed through by the ruling coalition of merkel 's conservatives and the spd , business chiefs said more was needed to boost confidence and enable germany , the world 's biggest exporter of goods , to withstand the effects of what many economists say will be the country 's deepest recession since the end of world war ii .
executives from eight major german companies , including volkswagen , adidas and basf , are said in a report to be published by german news magazine der spiegel on monday , dec .
8 , that the government had not done enough to combat the economic slowdown .
" we are facing a situation that is absolutely extraordinary - and we can not emerge from it with the traditional political and economic approaches , " volkswagen boss martin winterkorn said .
the options offered to the government by the business chiefs included tax cuts , which merkel has ruled out until after next september 's election .
glos defies chancellor to call for tax breaks but german economy minister michael glos defied merkel on sunday by siding with the business leaders to issue an urgent call for quick tax cuts to battle the deepening recession .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos breaks ranks to go against merkel on tax breaks " a tax cut for average earners ahead of the election would send the right message , " glos , a member of merkel 's conservative bloc , told the mass-market bild am sonntag .
" people who work hard to advance the gross national product should get more from the fruits of their labor . "
glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the christian democrats ' bavarian sister party , said tax breaks could have a powerful " psychological " effect and motivate germany 's notoriously tight-fisted consumers to get out and shop .
" the tax decrease could be introduced on july 1 or made retroactively effective jan .
1 , 2009 , " glos said .
" where there is a will , there is a way . "
the head of the federation of german industry , juergen thumann , renewed his call for quick tax cuts to fight the economic crisis in a statement issued sunday .
" it would have a positive effect on growth and employment , " he said .
other options supported by the business leaders included the voucher plan put forward by members of the spd .
consumer vouchers proposed to kick-start recovery the vouchers would allow german consumers to pay for " a new refrigerator , small renovations around the house , the things people have been putting off , " said andrea nahles , a deputy leader of the spd .
merkel , however , is still drawing the line , saying such measures would rip a giant hole in the budget and spark an only brief flurry of economic activity that would fizzle out before it had done much good .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vouchers would be used to get people spending so far , economists and most of the press agree that the vouchers would be a cheap and ineffective political ploy .
" the vouchers would only boost the economy for three months at the most and the effect would disappear if the recession is a long one , " the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung wrote last week .
german consumers are notoriously frugal , borne of a persistent post-war aversion to personal debt .
but the finance minister , centrist social democrat peer steinbrueck , also opposes any hasty measures to encourage a shopping spree , saying the voucher proposal would cost between 30 and 40 billion euros .
surprisingly , german retailers also oppose the vouchers , noting that the holiday shopping season that opened last weekend looked fairly promising despite the economic downturn .
" at the moment , the decline in inflation and unemployment and a rise in incomes are stimulating spending , " said the head of the german retailers association , stefan genth .
he warned that the promise of vouchers in the coming months could backfire , hobbling holiday sales while germans put off spending until they get their state-sponsored windfall .
" that 's the last thing we need in the middle of the christmas season , " genth said .
as calls for more action mount , german commentators believe a new investment or economic program is inevitable .
calls increase for new economic program steinbrueck has ruled out a new economic program before easter , but may be willing to do more in the longer term .
" whether and how far we will next year have to expand what we have already agreed upon depends on concrete developments , " steinbrueck said in hamburg on sunday .
but business leaders are clamoring for immediate action .
" we must at all costs make sure the crisis does not turn into a devastating conflagration , " said volkswagen 's winterkorn .
" we are in an exceptional situation , and traditional political and economic instruments will not be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck rules out a new economic program - for now werner wenning , head of pharmaceutical giant bayer echoed that view .
" the government should do more , but with well-considered initiatives which support growth and strengthen competition , " he told der spiegel .
feeling the pressure , merkel announced sunday that she would hold a high-profile meeting of top politicians and economic experts in the coming week to discuss the outlook for next year .
merkel told bild that the meeting , to take place next sunday in berlin , would include her finance and economy ministers as well as representatives from the banking sector and economic experts .
" for an effective response to the looming economic developments , we need an all-encompassing and careful analysis , " merkel told bild .
the newspaper said , however , that no new concrete economic measures would be decided at the meeting .
" sunday will be about getting a general analysis and obtaining as much clarity as possible about the economic developments in 2009 .

the report from government adviser sir jim rose wants to create a more flexible , less " overloaded " timetable .
it also calls for children to learn more about well-being , happiness and healthy living .
sir jim rejected this was " dumbing down " and said the changes reflected the skills most needed by children .
responsible citizens sir jim was asked by the government to carry out a " root-and-branch " review of what is taught in primary schools .
' areas of learning ' understanding english , communication and languages mathematical understanding scientific and technological understanding human , social and environmental understanding understanding physical health and well-being understanding the arts and design his interim review suggests that there could be six broader " areas of learning " , rather than up to 14 individual subjects , such as history , geography and science .
" we 're not destroying subject teaching - far from it .
we want it to be done more rigorously , " says sir jim .
speaking at the launch of the review , he said there had been a false distinction between teaching individual subjects and across topics and that it was possible to do both .

but he said that this would mean a reduction in overall content - with the details of the subject matter which would no longer be taught still to be decided .
as well as cutting out subjects , sir jim proposes a greater emphasis on life skills , including making lessons about emotional well-being and social skills a compulsory part of the curriculum .
pupils should have the " personal , social and emotional qualities essential to their health , well-being and life as a responsible citizen in the 21st century " .
sir jim also argues that the primary curriculum needs to reflect changes in children 's experiences and it should recognise that many young children have developed computer skills in their own homes .

such technology skills should also be used in other lessons , recommends sir jim .

" good primary teaching deepens and widens children 's understanding by firing their imagination and interest in learning .
one highly promising route to meeting the demand for in-depth teaching and learning is undoubtedly emerging through ict , " says sir jim .

the report from government adviser sir jim rose wants to create a more flexible , less " overloaded " timetable .
it also calls for children to learn more about well-being , happiness and healthy living .
sir jim rejected this was " dumbing down " and said the changes reflected the skills most needed by children .
responsible citizens sir jim was asked by the government to carry out a " root-and-branch " review of what is taught in primary schools .
' areas of learning ' understanding english , communication and languages mathematical understanding scientific and technological understanding human , social and environmental understanding understanding physical health and well-being understanding the arts and design his interim review suggests that there could be six broader " areas of learning " , rather than up to 14 individual subjects , such as history , geography and science .
" we 're not destroying subject teaching - far from it .
we want it to be done more rigorously , " says sir jim .
speaking at the launch of the review , he said there had been a false distinction between teaching individual subjects and across topics and that it was possible to do both .
the proposals suggest that " key ideas " might overlap different subjects - and sir jim gave as an example the way that learning about human settlements could teach about both history and geography .
but he said that this would mean a reduction in overall content - with the details of the subject matter which would no longer be taught still to be decided .
as well as cutting out subjects , sir jim proposes a greater emphasis on life skills , including making lessons about emotional well-being and social skills a compulsory part of the curriculum .
pupils should have the " personal , social and emotional qualities essential to their health , well-being and life as a responsible citizen in the 21st century " .
sir jim also argues that the primary curriculum needs to reflect changes in children 's experiences and it should recognise that many young children have developed computer skills in their own homes .
primary podcasts he says the level of lessons in information , communication and technology -lrb- ict -rrb- currently taught in secondary schools should now be taught to primary-age pupils .
such technology skills should also be used in other lessons , recommends sir jim .
this could include using the internet for research , word-processing work and making podcasts .
" good primary teaching deepens and widens children 's understanding by firing their imagination and interest in learning .
one highly promising route to meeting the demand for in-depth teaching and learning is undoubtedly emerging through ict , " says sir jim .
" the primary curriculum needs to be forward-looking . "
he said advances in technology and the internet revolution were driving a pace of change that would have been unimaginable when the national curriculum was created 20 years ago .
have your say happiness is not a learnt skill and is not measurable - what brings happiness to one will not bring it for another lynne , newport gwent send us your comments the report also says that summer-born children should start primary school the september after their fourth birthday , but some children should be able to begin school part-time if that is what their parents want .
children 's secretary ed balls , attending the launch of the report , also highlighted the technology skills of primary-age pupils .
" we need 21st century schools which make the most of the opportunities technology offers our computer-savvy youngsters , " said mr balls .
the final report of the review will be published in spring 2009 , with any recommendations accepted by the government to be introduced from september 2011 .

the report from government adviser sir jim rose wants to create a more flexible , less " overloaded " timetable .
it also calls for children to learn more about well-being , happiness and healthy living .
sir jim rejected this was " dumbing down " and said the changes reflected the skills most needed by children .
responsible citizens sir jim was asked by the government to carry out a " root-and-branch " review of what is taught in primary schools .
' areas of learning ' understanding english , communication and languages mathematical understanding scientific and technological understanding human , social and environmental understanding understanding physical health and well-being understanding the arts and design his interim review suggests that there could be six broader " areas of learning " , rather than up to 14 individual subjects , such as history , geography and science .
" we 're not destroying subject teaching - far from it .
we want it to be done more rigorously , " says sir jim .
speaking at the launch of the review , he said there had been a false distinction between teaching individual subjects and across topics and that it was possible to do both .
the proposals suggest that " key ideas " might overlap different subjects - and sir jim gave as an example the way that learning about human settlements could teach about both history and geography .
but he said that this would mean a reduction in overall content - with the details of the subject matter which would no longer be taught still to be decided .
as well as cutting out subjects , sir jim proposes a greater emphasis on life skills , including making lessons about emotional well-being and social skills a compulsory part of the curriculum .
pupils should have the " personal , social and emotional qualities essential to their health , well-being and life as a responsible citizen in the 21st century " .
sir jim also argues that the primary curriculum needs to reflect changes in children 's experiences and it should recognise that many young children have developed computer skills in their own homes .
primary podcasts he says the level of lessons in information , communication and technology -lrb- ict -rrb- currently taught in secondary schools should now be taught to primary-age pupils .
such technology skills should also be used in other lessons , recommends sir jim .
this could include using the internet for research , word-processing work and making podcasts .
" good primary teaching deepens and widens children 's understanding by firing their imagination and interest in learning .
one highly promising route to meeting the demand for in-depth teaching and learning is undoubtedly emerging through ict , " says sir jim .
" the primary curriculum needs to be forward-looking . "
he said advances in technology and the internet revolution were driving a pace of change that would have been unimaginable when the national curriculum was created 20 years ago .
have your say happiness is not a learnt skill and is not measurable - what brings happiness to one will not bring it for another lynne , newport gwent send us your comments the report also says that summer-born children should start primary school the september after their fourth birthday , but some children should be able to begin school part-time if that is what their parents want .
children 's secretary ed balls , attending the launch of the report , also highlighted the technology skills of primary-age pupils .
" we need 21st century schools which make the most of the opportunities technology offers our computer-savvy youngsters , " said mr balls .
the final report of the review will be published in spring 2009 , with any recommendations accepted by the government to be introduced from september 2011 .
' erosion ' the conservatives ' children 's secretary , michael gove , said the shift away from subjects meant a dilution of learning .
" the government ’ s changes to the primary curriculum will lead to children learning less not more .
the move away from traditional subject areas will lead to a further erosion of standards , " said mr gove .
liberal democrat children 's spokesman david laws said schools needed greater freedom to set their own teaching priorities , not a new set of government directives .
" while it skills are extremely important , they must not come at the expense of giving children a good grounding in the basics of literacy and numeracy . "
the national association of head teachers welcomed the emphasis on well-being , saying that such an " ethos of holistic education " was one of most important aspects of primary school .
but the nasuwt general secretary chris keates warned that any benefits from the changes would still be constrained by the tests and league tables at the end of primary school .
" the rose review presents an opportunity to remove this outdated , divisive method of school accountability , " she said .

familial hypercholesterolaemia - or fh - is a genetic condition which causes high levels of cholesterol , leading to heart attacks in young adults .
it is estimated around 5,000 people in wales unknowingly have the condition .
the assembly government is working towards developing a testing programme for people who find out a member of their family has fh .
lifestyle changes and medication can then help prevent heart disease .
dr alan rees , a consultant specialising in the area , said it was " a systematic failure of the nhs " across the uk that the condition was not being diagnosed in the majority of sufferers .
" we know that there 's a gene frequency of one in 500 - we know there should be 6,000 people in wales with fh and we have diagnosed about 1,000 so that means about 80 % of the people with fh in wales are walking around oblivious of the fact they have got this diagnosis , " he said .
" and what happens is they drop dead or have very early heart attacks with catastrophic effects on their family .
" we also know that if we diagnose this early we can prevent the consequences , we can prevent the heart disease . "
he added : " i 'm glad to say that the minister of health edwina hart has announced that she 's going to support the project of what we call cascade screening to identify those hitherto unidentified patients in wales and to treat them early .
" and i do believe that therefore wales will be ahead of the game . "
" immediate family members have had heart attacks in the past ... and that 's why we decided to have our children tested " elin evans the assembly government 's lead cardiac adviser , dr phil thomas , has been working with cardiac specialists to develop a model for implementing testing for fh in wales .
the model proposes a family cascade system , which means doctors who test someone with high cholesterol or heart disease and discover they have fh can then test other members of their family , both young and old .
elin evans , whose daughter heledd , 10 , has been diagnosed with fh , said she would encourage others with a family history of cholesterol and heart disease to have tests .
" immediate family members have had heart attacks in the past .
we both -lsb- her and her husband -rsb- had high cholesterol and a close member of the family died at a young age with a heart attack , " she said .
" and that 's why we decided to have our children tested and one of the children , heledd , came back with a very high level of cholesterol in her blood .
" she 's remarkably well and healthy and hopefully now in the new year she will be starting on statins -lsb- drugs which lower cholesterol -rsb- . "
heledd added : " i eat healthy and keep fit by playing football , rugby and swimming . "
a spokesman for the assembly government said it had submitted a bid for the family cascade testing model to the british heart foundation -lrb- bhf -rrb- for consideration .
" the health minister , edwina hart , has given a commitment that the welsh assembly government would work with the bhf to help fund the setting up and long term costs of a fh service in wales and she welcomes the opportunity to work in partnership , " he said .

a screening programme is expected to be rolled out across wales to identify people at risk of early heart attacks .
familial hypercholesterolaemia - or fh - is a genetic condition which causes high levels of cholesterol , leading to heart attacks in young adults .
it is estimated around 5,000 people in wales unknowingly have the condition .
the assembly government is working towards developing a testing programme for people who find out a member of their family has fh .
lifestyle changes and medication can then help prevent heart disease .
dr alan rees , a consultant specialising in the area , said it was " a systematic failure of the nhs " across the uk that the condition was not being diagnosed in the majority of sufferers .

consultant biochemist dr ian mcdowall explains how the screening process works .
" we know that there 's a gene frequency of one in 500 - we know there should be 6,000 people in wales with fh and we have diagnosed about 1,000 so that means about 80 % of the people with fh in wales are walking around oblivious of the fact they have got this diagnosis , " he said .
" and what happens is they drop dead or have very early heart attacks with catastrophic effects on their family .
" we also know that if we diagnose this early we can prevent the consequences , we can prevent the heart disease . "
he added : " i 'm glad to say that the minister of health edwina hart has announced that she 's going to support the project of what we call cascade screening to identify those hitherto unidentified patients in wales and to treat them early .
" and i do believe that therefore wales will be ahead of the game . "

the model proposes a family cascade system , which means doctors who test someone with high cholesterol or heart disease and discover they have fh can then test other members of their family , both young and old .
elin evans , whose daughter heledd , 10 , has been diagnosed with fh , said she would encourage others with a family history of cholesterol and heart disease to have tests .

but despite all the twists and turns , after nearly 450 years of feudal rule the tiny channel island is preparing to democratically elect 28 conseillers who will make up its government - the chief pleas .
this historic election , and the reasons behind it , has aroused worldwide interest to both the delight and consternation of residents .
sark is the smallest of the four main channel islands .
it is just 3 miles -lrb- 4.8km -rrb- long and 1.5 miles -lrb- 2.4km -rrb- wide , with a resident population of about 600 .
a total of 57 candidates have put themselves forward for election - about 12 % of the 474 eligible voters .
notable events 1940 : german occupation 1999 : female inheritance rights 2003 : right to divorce granted 2004 : death penalty abolished 2008 : law reform approved the roots of the current feudal system can be traced back to the mid 16th century when queen elizabeth i granted seigneur helier de carteret the fiefdom -lrb- inherited lands -rrb- of sark .
this gave the seigneur -lrb- lord -rrb- the right to colonise the island with 40 families from st ouen in jersey on the condition he guarded the island for the crown , protecting it from pirates .
the descendants of those families have governed sark ever since , with the exception of world war ii , when german troops occupied the channel islands from 1940 until they were liberated in 1945 .
the current seigneur is 80-year-old john michael beaumont , who inherited his position as feudal overlord in 1967 upon the death of his grandmother and the dame of sark , sibyl hathaway .
in keeping with every seigneur over the past four centuries , mr beaumont has continued to pay the annual sum of £ 1.79 -lrb- one twentieth of a knight 's fee -rrb- to the british crown for his fiefdom .
the first tentative step to democracy was taken in 1922 when the chief pleas , made up of the 40 hereditary tenants -lrb- landowners -rrb- , introduced 12 deputies elected by the people .
the new chief pleas will have to consider the seneschal 's future role another notable change came about in 1999 when the chief pleas voted to allow islanders the right to decide who can inherit their property .
until then women could only inherit if there were no male heirs .
however , two events at the end of the 20th century brought sark 's feudal system of government under the glare of the spotlight - the european convention of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- and the sale of the neighbouring island of brecqhou to the billionaire telegraph group owners , sir david and sir frederick barclay , in 1993 .
with the echr requirement to ensure laws applicable to sark complied with the international agreement , the chief pleas started on the rocky road to democracy .
proposals for reform were rejected in 2005 and 2007 until the island 's historic referendum in february .
' fair trial ' breach the barclay twins have fought for more radical reform , claiming the remaining inherited and unelected roles of seigneur and seneschal are a breach of human rights .
on 2 december - just eight days before the election - the barclays won a partial victory when the civil court of appeal ruled the seneschal 's dual role - as senior judge and president of the chief pleas - breached the " fair trial " provisions of article 6 of the convention .
however , they refused to quash the reform law , pointing out that neither the seneschal nor the seigneur had the right to vote in the chief pleas .
in order to comply with international laws , the judges suggested the seneschal should withdraw from his role as president of the chief pleas .
the future role of seneschal could therefore be one of the early matters debated by 28 conseillers , democratically elected in wednesday 's historic election .

the first tentative step to democracy was taken in 1922 when the chief pleas , made up of the 40 hereditary tenants -lrb- landowners -rrb- , introduced 12 deputies elected by the people .
the new chief pleas will have to consider the seneschal 's future role another notable change came about in 1999 when the chief pleas voted to allow islanders the right to decide who can inherit their property .
until then women could only inherit if there were no male heirs .
however , two events at the end of the 20th century brought sark 's feudal system of government under the glare of the spotlight - the european convention of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- and the sale of the neighbouring island of brecqhou to the billionaire telegraph group owners , sir david and sir frederick barclay , in 1993 .
with the echr requirement to ensure laws applicable to sark complied with the international agreement , the chief pleas started on the rocky road to democracy .
proposals for reform were rejected in 2005 and 2007 until the island 's historic referendum in february .
' fair trial ' breach the barclay twins have fought for more radical reform , claiming the remaining inherited and unelected roles of seigneur and seneschal are a breach of human rights .
on 2 december - just eight days before the election - the barclays won a partial victory when the civil court of appeal ruled the seneschal 's dual role - as senior judge and president of the chief pleas - breached the " fair trial " provisions of article 6 of the convention .
however , they refused to quash the reform law , pointing out that neither the seneschal nor the seigneur had the right to vote in the chief pleas .
in order to comply with international laws , the judges suggested the seneschal should withdraw from his role as president of the chief pleas .
the future role of seneschal could therefore be one of the early matters debated by 28 conseillers , democratically elected in wednesday 's historic election .

but despite all the twists and turns , after nearly 450 years of feudal rule the tiny channel island is preparing to democratically elect 28 conseillers who will make up its government - the chief pleas .
this historic election , and the reasons behind it , has aroused worldwide interest to both the delight and consternation of residents .
sark is the smallest of the four main channel islands .
it is just 3 miles -lrb- 4.8km -rrb- long and 1.5 miles -lrb- 2.4km -rrb- wide , with a resident population of about 600 .
a total of 57 candidates have put themselves forward for election - about 12 % of the 474 eligible voters .
notable events 1940 : german occupation 1999 : female inheritance rights 2003 : right to divorce granted 2004 : death penalty abolished 2008 : law reform approved the roots of the current feudal system can be traced back to the mid 16th century when queen elizabeth i granted seigneur helier de carteret the fiefdom -lrb- inherited lands -rrb- of sark .
this gave the seigneur -lrb- lord -rrb- the right to colonise the island with 40 families from st ouen in jersey on the condition he guarded the island for the crown , protecting it from pirates .
the descendants of those families have governed sark ever since , with the exception of world war ii , when german troops occupied the channel islands from 1940 until they were liberated in 1945 .
the current seigneur is 80-year-old john michael beaumont , who inherited his position as feudal overlord in 1967 upon the death of his grandmother and the dame of sark , sibyl hathaway .
in keeping with every seigneur over the past four centuries , mr beaumont has continued to pay the annual sum of £ 1.79 -lrb- one twentieth of a knight 's fee -rrb- to the british crown for his fiefdom .

the mexican defence department also said that at least eight bodies had been found in a shallow grave in central michoacan state .

he has repeatedly stated his conviction that unless the traffickers are defeated , mexico 's future as a viable country is uncertain .

ten suspected traffickers and a soldier were killed in a shootout on sunday in the southern state of guerrero .
another six people were killed in the north of the country when gunmen opened fire inside a pool hall in ciudad juarez , on the us-mexico border .
the mexican defence department also said that at least eight bodies had been found in a shallow grave in central michoacan state .
at dawn on sunday morning in the normally quiet town of arcelia , residents were woken by the sound of a major gun battle .
initially it appears to have been between rival heavily armed drug gangs in a fleet of cars .
later the police and army joined in .
by the time it all ended , 11 people , including one soldier were dead .
the confrontation exemplifies what many observers say is behind the violence that is spiralling in mexico .
two years ago , president felipe calderon launched an all-out assault on the country 's drug cartels , which for many years had operated with minimal government interference .
under pressure for their lucrative routes , the traffickers are fighting both among themselves , and against federal forces .
pressure the brutality of this war is shocking mexico .
every day , the papers contain vivid images of another killing .
also on sunday , ciudad juarez , focus of much of the recent violence , provided yet another headline .
armed men drew their weapons inside a billiards hall , murdering six people .
and in michoacan state , west of mexico city , soldiers uncovered a shallow grave , with the remains of at least eight bodies .
the corpses had been cut in pieces and burned .
president calderon is facing some pressure from those who wonder whether the war against the cartels is winnable .
he has repeatedly stated his conviction that unless the traffickers are defeated , mexico 's future as a viable country is uncertain .

but for millions it never went away .
as part of a series on britain 's jobless , one man whose career was shattered by illness explains how and why lack of work has touched his life .
for richard bassil , 46 , work was not just work , it was his life .
but for the past seven years he has existed without it .
now he feels he has a " mountain to climb " to ever return to where he was .
richard , who is single and lives in a garden flat in southampton , is one of more than two million people in britain who are not in work - and not seeking work - because they are long-term sick .
despite being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - manic depression - in his early 20s , he had maintained his career as a design draughtsman for almost 17 years before things hit the buffers .
britain 's jobless our series asks , who are britain 's jobless ?
interviews with five people who are out of work published on the bbc news website in december and january read the first no-one works in our house q & a : who are the jobless ?
key statistics " when i hear friends say they wish they 'd won the lottery and did n't have to work , i say you do n't realise how much you 'd miss the job .
you do n't realise how much of a part of your life it is , until it goes , " he says .
working was n't always easy , and there were problems along the way .
sometimes richard became so unwell he had to be admitted to psychiatric hospital .
at one stage his bosses turned up at his bedside to make him redundant .
" i was amazed that they considered that a good idea , " he says .
but overall he was coping , was finding jobs and contract work and had established the right level of treatment to stay well .
in 2001 things changed after the anti-psychotic drugs he was taking were withdrawn from the market .
about the time he switched to a different treatment , he attempted suicide and ended up in intensive care for eight days . "
high moods can be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert - it 's a positive thing at one level , and destructive when it gets severe " richard bassil " i lost my contract after that , and my employment agency stopped offering me work . "
bipolar disorder is an emotional condition , which causes people to swing between the highs and lows of mania and depression .
where previously richard had experienced more highs and less depression , after the suicide attempt things changed .
" after that it was very long periods of depression , as opposed to the multiple high moods - which i could work with as long as they were controlled .
" high moods can actually be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert , more able to associate ideas .
it 's a positive thing at one level , and a destructive thing when it gets severe . "
how bipolar affects richard cycle of highs and lows - mania , then depression during manic period optimism increases , multiple projects started ; chaos ensues ; develops delusions of grandeur , loses touch with reality periods of mania usually end in admission to hospital , often sectioned under mental health act subsequent prolonged depression causes lack of motivation , negative thoughts , demoralisation and withdrawal from society guide to bipolar disorder an episode of severe mania for richard usually ends in him being sectioned under the mental health act , which has happened about once a year since he stopped working .
after the high , always , comes the depression .
it usually lasts for months on end .
" you become totally inactive , lacking any motivation and your thinking becomes very negative .
you become demoralised and withdraw yourself from social situations . "
where possible richard occupies himself with projects at home , voluntary work and attending music and woodwork sessions at a social services centre .
he practises guitar most days , tries to keep stimulated .
he has pressed for a new drugs regime , and plots out " mood charts " to keep tabs on his state of mind .
" it 's about coping . "
he thinks about how and when he can return to work .
often , when he is in a high mood , he will start making plans on getting jobs or running his own business .
but then the mania takes over , and it is back to square one .
the fact that richard loved his job so much was a positive force in his life .
but it was also part of the problem .
" something i suffered from early on in my life , and still do to a certain extent , is a wish for perfection and a fear of failure .
those are not necessarily good traits in terms of not letting yourself become overwhelmed . "
his illness would often escalate at the end of large projects , as the pressure released and he " let go " , he says .
' trapped ' the erosion of his confidence since becoming unemployed is a further barrier to working again in the future , which is part of the vicious cycle many jobless people describe .
" i wonder whether i could ever go back to the job i did .
engineering is my love , and it 's finding something that would give me the same sense of satisfaction and use my skills . "
and convincing an employer to take him on after seven years of not working is hard to imagine , he says , not least because even if his health stabilises he can not guarantee he will not become unwell again .
" in the past i 've hidden my illness when going for job interviews , but now i could n't do that .
and it would be impossible given the length of time . "
meanwhile he gets by on incapacity benefit and low-rate disability living allowance , which gives him about £ 84 a week for food , bills , clothes and general spending .
his rent and council tax are covered by benefits .
" it 's not a lot of money but if you 're careful with it ... it 's not really about the benefits , i 'd just much rather be working . "
he feels trapped by the system because it is so hard to keep coming on and off benefits .
occasionally he works with a friend , fitting kitchens and bathrooms , but can only earn £ 20 a week from it before it starts affecting his payments .
' scary ' it would be better if people with chronic health conditions could effectively stay on benefits permanently , but then work when they were well enough and have their benefits adjusted accordingly , says richard .
trying to return to a level of work that could completely replace benefits is " scary " , he adds .
" it seems you 've got to jump out of the frying pan into the fire .
there 's no halfway house .
" it 's a frightening feeling to imagine getting back into employment from the situation i am in . "

as part of a series on britain 's jobless , one man whose career was shattered by illness explains how and why lack of work has touched his life .
for richard bassil , 46 , work was not just work , it was his life .
but for the past seven years he has existed without it .
now he feels he has a " mountain to climb " to ever return to where he was .
richard , who is single and lives in a garden flat in southampton , is one of more than two million people in britain who are not in work - and not seeking work - because they are long-term sick .
despite being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - manic depression - in his early 20s , he had maintained his career as a design draughtsman for almost 17 years before things hit the buffers .
britain 's jobless our series asks , who are britain 's jobless ?
interviews with five people who are out of work published on the bbc news website in december and january read the first no-one works in our house q & a : who are the jobless ?
key statistics " when i hear friends say they wish they 'd won the lottery and did n't have to work , i say you do n't realise how much you 'd miss the job .
you do n't realise how much of a part of your life it is , until it goes , " he says .
working was n't always easy , and there were problems along the way .
sometimes richard became so unwell he had to be admitted to psychiatric hospital .
at one stage his bosses turned up at his bedside to make him redundant .
" i was amazed that they considered that a good idea , " he says .
but overall he was coping , was finding jobs and contract work and had established the right level of treatment to stay well .
in 2001 things changed after the anti-psychotic drugs he was taking were withdrawn from the market .
about the time he switched to a different treatment , he attempted suicide and ended up in intensive care for eight days .
high moods can be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert - it 's a positive thing at one level , and destructive when it gets severe richard bassil " i lost my contract after that , and my employment agency stopped offering me work . "
bipolar disorder is an emotional condition , which causes people to swing between the highs and lows of mania and depression .
where previously richard had experienced more highs and less depression , after the suicide attempt things changed .
" after that it was very long periods of depression , as opposed to the multiple high moods - which i could work with as long as they were controlled .
" high moods can actually be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert , more able to associate ideas .
it 's a positive thing at one level , and a destructive thing when it gets severe . "
how bipolar affects richard cycle of highs and lows - mania , then depression during manic period optimism increases , multiple projects started ; chaos ensues ; develops delusions of grandeur , loses touch with reality periods of mania usually end in admission to hospital , often sectioned under mental health act subsequent prolonged depression causes lack of motivation , negative thoughts , demoralisation and withdrawal from society guide to bipolar disorder an episode of severe mania for richard usually ends in him being sectioned under the mental health act , which has happened about once a year since he stopped working .
after the high , always , comes the depression .
it usually lasts for months on end .
" you become totally inactive , lacking any motivation and your thinking becomes very negative .
you become demoralised and withdraw yourself from social situations . "
where possible richard occupies himself with projects at home , voluntary work and attending music and woodwork sessions at a social services centre .
he practises guitar most days , tries to keep stimulated .
he has pressed for a new drugs regime , and plots out " mood charts " to keep tabs on his state of mind .

" it 's about coping . "
he thinks about how and when he can return to work .
often , when he is in a high mood , he will start making plans on getting jobs or running his own business .
but then the mania takes over , and it is back to square one .
the fact that richard loved his job so much was a positive force in his life .
but it was also part of the problem .
" something i suffered from early on in my life , and still do to a certain extent , is a wish for perfection and a fear of failure .
those are not necessarily good traits in terms of not letting yourself become overwhelmed . "
his illness would often escalate at the end of large projects , as the pressure released and he " let go " , he says .
' trapped ' the erosion of his confidence since becoming unemployed is a further barrier to working again in the future , which is part of the vicious cycle many jobless people describe .
" i wonder whether i could ever go back to the job i did .
engineering is my love , and it 's finding something that would give me the same sense of satisfaction and use my skills . "
and convincing an employer to take him on after seven years of not working is hard to imagine , he says , not least because even if his health stabilises he can not guarantee he will not become unwell again .
would returning to his old career be good for richard 's health ?
" in the past i 've hidden my illness when going for job interviews , but now i could n't do that .
and it would be impossible given the length of time . "
meanwhile he gets by on incapacity benefit and low-rate disability living allowance , which gives him about £ 84 a week for food , bills , clothes and general spending .
his rent and council tax are covered by benefits .
" it 's not a lot of money but if you 're careful with it ... it 's not really about the benefits , i 'd just much rather be working . "
he feels trapped by the system because it is so hard to keep coming on and off benefits .
occasionally he works with a friend , fitting kitchens and bathrooms , but can only earn £ 20 a week from it before it starts affecting his payments .
' scary ' it would be better if people with chronic health conditions could effectively stay on benefits permanently , but then work when they were well enough and have their benefits adjusted accordingly , says richard .
trying to return to a level of work that could completely replace benefits is " scary " , he adds .
" it seems you 've got to jump out of the frying pan into the fire .
there 's no halfway house .
" it 's a frightening feeling to imagine getting back into employment from the situation i am in . "

click here to download the flash plugin from the macromedia website with the rate of redundancies rising and the number of job vacancies shrinking , unemployment is back in the headlines .
but for millions it never went away .
as part of a series on britain 's jobless , one man whose career was shattered by illness explains how and why lack of work has touched his life .
for richard bassil , 46 , work was not just work , it was his life .
but for the past seven years he has existed without it .
now he feels he has a " mountain to climb " to ever return to where he was .
richard , who is single and lives in a garden flat in southampton , is one of more than two million people in britain who are not in work - and not seeking work - because they are long-term sick .
despite being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - manic depression - in his early 20s , he had maintained his career as a design draughtsman for almost 17 years before things hit the buffers .
britain 's jobless our series asks , who are britain 's jobless ?
interviews with five people who are out of work published on the bbc news website in december and january read the first no-one works in our house q & a : who are the jobless ?
key statistics " when i hear friends say they wish they 'd won the lottery and did n't have to work , i say you do n't realise how much you 'd miss the job .
you do n't realise how much of a part of your life it is , until it goes , " he says .
working was n't always easy , and there were problems along the way .
sometimes richard became so unwell he had to be admitted to psychiatric hospital .
at one stage his bosses turned up at his bedside to make him redundant .
" i was amazed that they considered that a good idea , " he says .
but overall he was coping , was finding jobs and contract work and had established the right level of treatment to stay well .
in 2001 things changed after the anti-psychotic drugs he was taking were withdrawn from the market .
about the time he switched to a different treatment , he attempted suicide and ended up in intensive care for eight days .
high moods can be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert - it 's a positive thing at one level , and destructive when it gets severe richard bassil " i lost my contract after that , and my employment agency stopped offering me work . "
bipolar disorder is an emotional condition , which causes people to swing between the highs and lows of mania and depression .
where previously richard had experienced more highs and less depression , after the suicide attempt things changed .
" after that it was very long periods of depression , as opposed to the multiple high moods - which i could work with as long as they were controlled .
" high moods can actually be advantageous in a work situation because you tend to be more alert , more able to associate ideas .
it 's a positive thing at one level , and a destructive thing when it gets severe . "
how bipolar affects richard cycle of highs and lows - mania , then depression during manic period optimism increases , multiple projects started ; chaos ensues ; develops delusions of grandeur , loses touch with reality periods of mania usually end in admission to hospital , often sectioned under mental health act subsequent prolonged depression causes lack of motivation , negative thoughts , demoralisation and withdrawal from society guide to bipolar disorder an episode of severe mania for richard usually ends in him being sectioned under the mental health act , which has happened about once a year since he stopped working .
after the high , always , comes the depression .
it usually lasts for months on end .
" you become totally inactive , lacking any motivation and your thinking becomes very negative .
you become demoralised and withdraw yourself from social situations . "
where possible richard occupies himself with projects at home , voluntary work and attending music and woodwork sessions at a social services centre .
he practises guitar most days , tries to keep stimulated .
he has pressed for a new drugs regime , and plots out " mood charts " to keep tabs on his state of mind .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
" it 's about coping . "
he thinks about how and when he can return to work .
often , when he is in a high mood , he will start making plans on getting jobs or running his own business .
but then the mania takes over , and it is back to square one .
the fact that richard loved his job so much was a positive force in his life .
but it was also part of the problem .
" something i suffered from early on in my life , and still do to a certain extent , is a wish for perfection and a fear of failure .
those are not necessarily good traits in terms of not letting yourself become overwhelmed . "
his illness would often escalate at the end of large projects , as the pressure released and he " let go " , he says .
' trapped ' the erosion of his confidence since becoming unemployed is a further barrier to working again in the future , which is part of the vicious cycle many jobless people describe .
" i wonder whether i could ever go back to the job i did .
engineering is my love , and it 's finding something that would give me the same sense of satisfaction and use my skills . "
and convincing an employer to take him on after seven years of not working is hard to imagine , he says , not least because even if his health stabilises he can not guarantee he will not become unwell again .
would returning to his old career be good for richard 's health ?
" in the past i 've hidden my illness when going for job interviews , but now i could n't do that .
and it would be impossible given the length of time . "
meanwhile he gets by on incapacity benefit and low-rate disability living allowance , which gives him about £ 84 a week for food , bills , clothes and general spending .
his rent and council tax are covered by benefits .
" it 's not a lot of money but if you 're careful with it ... it 's not really about the benefits , i 'd just much rather be working . "
he feels trapped by the system because it is so hard to keep coming on and off benefits .
occasionally he works with a friend , fitting kitchens and bathrooms , but can only earn £ 20 a week from it before it starts affecting his payments .
' scary ' it would be better if people with chronic health conditions could effectively stay on benefits permanently , but then work when they were well enough and have their benefits adjusted accordingly , says richard .
trying to return to a level of work that could completely replace benefits is " scary " , he adds .
" it seems you 've got to jump out of the frying pan into the fire .
there 's no halfway house .
" it 's a frightening feeling to imagine getting back into employment from the situation i am in . "

the herpes virus behind cold sores is a major cause of the protein plaques that accumulate in the brains of people with alzheimer 's , scientists have shown .
on the plus side , the latest discovery by the university of manchester team may mean antiviral drugs used to treat cold sores could also prevent dementia .
the findings are published in the journal of pathology .
this could lead to new treatments for alzheimer 's , based on existing antiviral agents rebecca wood of the alzheimer 's research trust professor ruth itzhaki and colleagues found dna evidence of the herpes simplex virus -lrb- hsv -rrb- type 1 in 90 % of plaques in alzheimer 's disease patients ' brains .
they had previously shown that hsv1 infection of nerve-type cells in mice leads to deposition of the main component of the plaques - beta amyloid .
and that the virus is present in the brains of many elderly people and that in those people with a specific genetic factor , there is a high risk of developing alzheimer 's disease .
taken together , the researchers say the findings strongly implicate the cold sore-causing virus as a root cause of alzheimer 's dementia .
professor itzhaki said : " we suggest that hsv1 enters the brain in the elderly as their immune systems decline and then establishes a dormant infection from which it is repeatedly activated by events such as stress , immunosuppression , and various infections . "
cell damage in turn , this causes damages the brain cells , which die and then disintegrate , releasing the proteins which develop into amyloid plaques , she said .
the researchers now plan to test whether antiviral drugs used to treat cold sores , which block the action of hsv1 , might stop the cell damage that leads to alzheimer 's .
another possibility is vaccination against the virus to prevent the development of the disease in the first place .
rebecca wood of the alzheimer 's research trust said : " this could lead to new treatments for alzheimer 's , based on existing antiviral agents .
however , the underlying causes of alzheimer 's disease are still unknown .
much more research is needed if we are to offer hope to the 700,000 people in the uk who live with alzheimer 's and related dementias . "
professor clive ballard of the alzheimer 's society said : " although the new research provides some additional evidence supporting a link between the herpes virus and alzheimer 's disease there is still uncertainty around whether this is a promising avenue of research . "
most people become infected with hsv1 , which then remains dormant in the facial nerve emerging periodically in 20-40 % of those infected to cause cold sores .

the herpes virus behind cold sores is a major cause of the protein plaques that accumulate in the brains of people with alzheimer 's , scientists have shown .
on the plus side , the latest discovery by the university of manchester team may mean antiviral drugs used to treat cold sores could also prevent dementia .
the findings are published in the journal of pathology .
this could lead to new treatments for alzheimer 's , based on existing antiviral agents rebecca wood of the alzheimer 's research trust professor ruth itzhaki and colleagues found dna evidence of the herpes simplex virus -lrb- hsv -rrb- type 1 in 90 % of plaques in alzheimer 's disease patients ' brains .
they had previously shown that hsv1 infection of nerve-type cells in mice leads to deposition of the main component of the plaques - beta amyloid .
and that the virus is present in the brains of many elderly people and that in those people with a specific genetic factor , there is a high risk of developing alzheimer 's disease .
taken together , the researchers say the findings strongly implicate the cold sore-causing virus as a root cause of alzheimer 's dementia .
professor itzhaki said : " we suggest that hsv1 enters the brain in the elderly as their immune systems decline and then establishes a dormant infection from which it is repeatedly activated by events such as stress , immunosuppression , and various infections . "
cell damage in turn , this causes damages the brain cells , which die and then disintegrate , releasing the proteins which develop into amyloid plaques , she said .
the researchers now plan to test whether antiviral drugs used to treat cold sores , which block the action of hsv1 , might stop the cell damage that leads to alzheimer 's .
another possibility is vaccination against the virus to prevent the development of the disease in the first place .
rebecca wood of the alzheimer 's research trust said : " this could lead to new treatments for alzheimer 's , based on existing antiviral agents .
however , the underlying causes of alzheimer 's disease are still unknown .
much more research is needed if we are to offer hope to the 700,000 people in the uk who live with alzheimer 's and related dementias . "
professor clive ballard of the alzheimer 's society said : " although the new research provides some additional evidence supporting a link between the herpes virus and alzheimer 's disease there is still uncertainty around whether this is a promising avenue of research . "

in just over a month , a new president will enter the white house promising to close down the detention camp that human rights groups have called the " gulag of our times " .
some 250 inmates remain at the us jail in guantanamo but on this , my third , visit to this small strip of land on the island of cuba that flies the stars and stripes , it seems as nothing much has changed .
true , some detainees have been released but around 250 remain .
there is no sign that the watch-towers and razor wire fences are about to be torn down .
in fact , the opposite - it is business as usual .
i am among around 50 journalists from all over the world who have been flown in by the us military to witness the latest appearance in court of the alleged mastermind of the attacks on 11 september 2001 , khalid sheikh mohammed .
khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants will appear in front of a military judge in a pre-trial , or motions , hearing and , in one sense , it does feel as if the bush administration is going through the motions .
this is a trials process - called military commissions - that has been condemned in us federal courts and all over the world .
president-elect barack obama is just one of many to criticise the trials process , the interrogation techniques used to extract confessions and the treatment of detainees .
this trial may never go ahead in its current form .
yet , in its final few days , the bush administration appears to have upped the ante .
face to face for the first time , the us military has invited the relatives of some of those who were killed in the attacks on 11 september to witness the proceedings .
representatives from five of the families who lost loved ones will be able to sit behind a glass screen in court , just feet away from those accused of committing mass murder .
i hope they stare us in the face and we stare back maureen santora mother of 9/11 victim one can only speculate as to why now .
is this a final chance for the bush administration to remind the rest of the world about the reason for guantanamo , the reason for these trials ?
it is clear that some of those still grieving are still waiting for justice .
more than 100 families applied by lottery for a seat in court .
maureen santora , who lost her son christopher in the attacks on new york 's twin towers , is one of the few who will be able to see the men accused in the flesh .
she has said : " i hope they stare us in the face and we stare back . "
this hearing will also give khalid sheikh mohammed a chance to question the proceedings .
much to his defence team 's consternation , he has chosen to represent himself .
in his first appearance in court six months ago he showed little remorse for the attacks on 9/11 .
on the contrary , he was happy to be seen as the mastermind .
there are still plenty of questions as to how the americans extracted any confessions .
the cia has admitted that he was one of the so-called " high value detainees " subjected to waterboarding , or simulated drowning .
on monday he will only have a chance to question the proceedings of the court , not his treatment .
but it is another chance to show his defiance and his hatred of america .
that and and the relatives ' anger and grief will only intensify the questions about what happens next and for barack obama these will not be easy decisions .
obama 's options vijay padmanabhan was until recently a legal advisor working at the us state department dealing with guantanamo .
he knows that closing it is easier said than done .
he acknowledges that the military commissions have been , in his words , " an abject failure " .
only three trials have been completed .
most have been held up in a legal quagmire .
but the alternatives for an obama administration are hardly appealing .
transferring dangerous men -lrb- and admittedly the pentagon acknowledges that not all of them are -rrb- to the us mainland to be tried in federal courts or by military courts martial would prove highly controversial .
the reaction back home is likely to be " not in my back yard " .
returning them to their countries of origin also has a high degree of risk .
many come from states that are unstable or repressive .
they could face torture or return to the battlefield .
vijay padmanabhan , who now teaches at new york 's cardozo law school , says there are no quick-fix solutions .
he adds that he will be " shocked " if guantanamo is closed by this time next year , such are the obstacles facing barack obama .
the president-elect along with much of the world may look on the current military commissions process as a travesty of justice , but what can he do to convince those families of the victims of 9/11 that justice will be done ?

in just over a month , a new president will enter the white house promising to close down the detention camp that human rights groups have called the " gulag of our times " .
some 250 inmates remain at the us jail in guantanamo but on this , my third , visit to this small strip of land on the island of cuba that flies the stars and stripes , it seems as nothing much has changed .
true , some detainees have been released but around 250 remain .
there is no sign that the watch-towers and razor wire fences are about to be torn down .
in fact , the opposite - it is business as usual .
i am among around 50 journalists from all over the world who have been flown in by the us military to witness the latest appearance in court of the alleged mastermind of the attacks on 11 september 2001 , khalid sheikh mohammed .
khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants will appear in front of a military judge in a pre-trial , or motions , hearing and , in one sense , it does feel as if the bush administration is going through the motions .
this is a trials process - called military commissions - that has been condemned in us federal courts and all over the world .
president-elect barack obama is just one of many to criticise the trials process , the interrogation techniques used to extract confessions and the treatment of detainees .
this trial may never go ahead in its current form .
yet , in its final few days , the bush administration appears to have upped the ante .
face to face for the first time , the us military has invited the relatives of some of those who were killed in the attacks on 11 september to witness the proceedings .
representatives from five of the families who lost loved ones will be able to sit behind a glass screen in court , just feet away from those accused of committing mass murder .
i hope they stare us in the face and we stare back maureen santora mother of 9/11 victim one can only speculate as to why now .

it is clear that some of those still grieving are still waiting for justice .
more than 100 families applied by lottery for a seat in court .
maureen santora , who lost her son christopher in the attacks on new york 's twin towers , is one of the few who will be able to see the men accused in the flesh .
she has said : " i hope they stare us in the face and we stare back . "
this hearing will also give khalid sheikh mohammed a chance to question the proceedings .
much to his defence team 's consternation , he has chosen to represent himself .
in his first appearance in court six months ago he showed little remorse for the attacks on 9/11 .
on the contrary , he was happy to be seen as the mastermind .
there are still plenty of questions as to how the americans extracted any confessions .
the cia has admitted that he was one of the so-called " high value detainees " subjected to waterboarding , or simulated drowning .
on monday he will only have a chance to question the proceedings of the court , not his treatment .
but it is another chance to show his defiance and his hatred of america .
that and and the relatives ' anger and grief will only intensify the questions about what happens next and for barack obama these will not be easy decisions .
obama 's options vijay padmanabhan was until recently a legal advisor working at the us state department dealing with guantanamo .
he knows that closing it is easier said than done .
he acknowledges that the military commissions have been , in his words , " an abject failure " .
only three trials have been completed .
most have been held up in a legal quagmire .
but the alternatives for an obama administration are hardly appealing .
transferring dangerous men -lrb- and admittedly the pentagon acknowledges that not all of them are -rrb- to the us mainland to be tried in federal courts or by military courts martial would prove highly controversial .
the reaction back home is likely to be " not in my back yard " .
returning them to their countries of origin also has a high degree of risk .
many come from states that are unstable or repressive .
they could face torture or return to the battlefield .
vijay padmanabhan , who now teaches at new york 's cardozo law school , says there are no quick-fix solutions .
he adds that he will be " shocked " if guantanamo is closed by this time next year , such are the obstacles facing barack obama .

occupants of a white sedan died after the car came under fire the iraqi government has accused blackwater security guards of killing the civilians on the morning of 16 september 2007 , while they were escorting an american diplomatic envoy in baghdad .
the company said the civilians were killed during a shootout after one of their convoys came under attack in nisoor square , in an affluent neighbourhood of the capital .
they said the guards reacted lawfully to gunfire deliberately aimed at them .
the iraqi government , citing eyewitness reports , concluded that the blackwater guards fired on civilians without provocation .
the government , which has called for the blackwater guards to face prosecution , welcomed news that five guards had been indicted in the us in december 2008 .
details of the charges are expected to be made public later on 8 december and the five men will surrender to federal authorities in utah , reports say .
until now , us officials have released few details of the incident as it has been the subject of an investigation by the fbi .
however , in november 2007 , the new york times quoted fbi officials as saying that the killings of at least 14 iraqi civilians had been unjustified .
one of the most detailed accounts of the events according to blackwater employees comes from an initial report by the us embassy .
this was seen by the washington post at the end of september 2007 .
embassy report it was described as a " spot report " and not intended to be authoritative .
it was dated the day of the attacks .
according to those accounts , blackwater teams encountered a car bomb , a shootout and a standoff between blackwater guards and iraqi security forces .
each blackwater team usually consists of three or four armoured vehicles .
the report said the incident began when a car bomb exploded at 11.53 near a financial compound in baghdad , while a us official was visiting .
it also said : two blackwater teams transported the official back to the fortified green zone another blackwater unit was dispatched to the scene of the car bomb to deal with the aftermath of the blast .
this unit , however , was then ambushed and " engaged with small arms fire " from " multiple nearby locations " in nisoor square .
one of the blackwater teams that had transported the official back to the green zone was re-dispatched to help out in nisoor square .
the re-deployed unit found itself stuck at an intersection in nisoor square and was confronted by iraqi police and army .
a us forces quick reaction team was sent to help rescue the unit .
separately , the washington post quoted a us official familiar with the investigation as saying that at least one blackwater guard drew a weapon on his colleagues and shouted at him to " stop shooting " .
the incident took place when nisoor square was busy with traffic accounts of what happened to the first blackwater unit to enter nisoor square have differed .
iraqi eyewitnesses have said that guards moved into the roundabout stopping the traffic .
they then fired on a white sedan that had failed to slow down .
according to those accounts , the car burst into flames killing the occupants .
one eyewitness said blackwater operatives had fired a rocket or grenade into the car .
those eyewitnesses say blackwater guards then fired without provocation into the surrounding area as civilians and iraqi officers tried to flee .
they say the officers did not return the fire .
also in september 2007 , an abc news report quoted what it said were sworn statements from blackwater employees .
a number of those said that they had fired on the white car after it failed to slow down despite hand and arm signals .
another guard said he returned fire at iraqis dressed as civilians .
eleven iraqis were initially believed to have died in the incident , but a further iraqi government investigation said a total of 17 people had been killed .

occupants of a white sedan died after the car came under fire the iraqi government has accused blackwater security guards of killing the civilians on the morning of 16 september 2007 , while they were escorting an american diplomatic envoy in baghdad .
the company said the civilians were killed during a shootout after one of their convoys came under attack in nisoor square , in an affluent neighbourhood of the capital .
they said the guards reacted lawfully to gunfire deliberately aimed at them .
the iraqi government , citing eyewitness reports , concluded that the blackwater guards fired on civilians without provocation .
the government , which has called for the blackwater guards to face prosecution , welcomed news that five guards had been indicted in the us in december 2008 .
details of the charges are expected to be made public later on 8 december and the five men will surrender to federal authorities in utah , reports say .
until now , us officials have released few details of the incident as it has been the subject of an investigation by the fbi .
however , in november 2007 , the new york times quoted fbi officials as saying that the killings of at least 14 iraqi civilians had been unjustified .
one of the most detailed accounts of the events according to blackwater employees comes from an initial report by the us embassy .
this was seen by the washington post at the end of september 2007 .
embassy report it was described as a " spot report " and not intended to be authoritative .
it was dated the day of the attacks .
according to those accounts , blackwater teams encountered a car bomb , a shootout and a standoff between blackwater guards and iraqi security forces .
each blackwater team usually consists of three or four armoured vehicles .
the report said the incident began when a car bomb exploded at 11.53 near a financial compound in baghdad , while a us official was visiting .
it also said : two blackwater teams transported the official back to the fortified green zone another blackwater unit was dispatched to the scene of the car bomb to deal with the aftermath of the blast .
this unit , however , was then ambushed and " engaged with small arms fire " from " multiple nearby locations " in nisoor square .
one of the blackwater teams that had transported the official back to the green zone was re-dispatched to help out in nisoor square .
the re-deployed unit found itself stuck at an intersection in nisoor square and was confronted by iraqi police and army .
a us forces quick reaction team was sent to help rescue the unit .
separately , the washington post quoted a us official familiar with the investigation as saying that at least one blackwater guard drew a weapon on his colleagues and shouted at him to " stop shooting " .
the incident took place when nisoor square was busy with traffic accounts of what happened to the first blackwater unit to enter nisoor square have differed .
iraqi eyewitnesses have said that guards moved into the roundabout stopping the traffic .
they then fired on a white sedan that had failed to slow down .
according to those accounts , the car burst into flames killing the occupants .
one eyewitness said blackwater operatives had fired a rocket or grenade into the car .
those eyewitnesses say blackwater guards then fired without provocation into the surrounding area as civilians and iraqi officers tried to flee .
they say the officers did not return the fire .
also in september 2007 , an abc news report quoted what it said were sworn statements from blackwater employees .
a number of those said that they had fired on the white car after it failed to slow down despite hand and arm signals .
another guard said he returned fire at iraqis dressed as civilians .
eleven iraqis were initially believed to have died in the incident , but a further iraqi government investigation said a total of 17 people had been killed .

a to z : state opening of parliament each new parliamentary session has to be opened by the monarch , who reads the speech prepared for him or her by the government of the day , setting out the legislative agenda for the coming parliamentary session .
in an ancient ceremony the queen arrives at the palace of westminster in the irish state coach .
but , observing a custom dating back to days when the monarch and parliament were on less cordial terms , a government whip is held ' hostage ' at buckingham palace to guarantee the safe return of the monarch .
yeomen of the guard search the palace cellars before the speech the tradition dates back to the gunpowder plot of 1605 sir christopher wren reinforced the ceremony in 1678 after rumours of another plot once the queen arrives at parliament the union flag is lowered and replaced by the royal standard .
after donning the royal robes in the robing room the queen and her procession move off to the house of lords .
when she enters the chamber the lighting inside is turned up to enhance the drama of the royal entrance .
once the queen is seated and the lords have taken their place black rod is ordered to summon the members of the house of commons to hear the royal address .
the speaker then leads mps to the upper house to take up their places at the bar of the house of lords to hear the speech .
state opening : some key dates 1536 : henry viii thought to be first monarch to attend state opening in person 1852 : queen victoria opens parliament in new building for first time 1958 : first television and radio broadcast of state opening once the commons have entered the chamber , the three constituent parts of parliament , the lords , the commons and the monarch , are gathered together in one place to hear the queen detail the business which requires their urgent presence in westminster .
since 1997 the ceremony has been simplified .
shortly after becoming prime minister gordon brown made a pre-queen 's speech outlining his proposals for government .
some think this may have undermined the impact of the event itself .

the blocked page of the online encyclopaedia shows an album cover of german heavy metal band scorpions , released in 1976 .
internet providers acted after online watchdog the internet watch foundation warned them its picture may be illegal .
the iwf said it was a " potentially illegal child sexual abuse image " .
some volunteers who run wikipedia said it was not for the foundation to censor one of the web 's most popular sites .
they also argued that the image was available in a number of books and had never been ruled illegal .
but the iwf , which warns internet providers about possible images that could be linked to child abuse , said it had consulted the police before making its decision .
the foundation 's list of proscribed sites is widely used by british internet service providers to filter out images showing child abuse and other illegal content .
it 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site david gerard , wikipedia volunteer as a result , the addition of the scorpions wikipedia page has made it inaccessible to the majority of british internet users .
the iwf , which lists the bbc , news international and internet companies aol -lrb- uk -rrb- and ask among its members , said as many as 95 % of british users would now be unable to access the page .
wikipedia volunteer david gerard said he and fellow users were angry that as well as the photo , the text on the page had been blocked .
" blocking text is a whole new thing - it 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site , " he said .
mr gerard also told bbc radio 4 's today programme the album cover was still available as part of the band 's box set and could be viewed on retail websites .
" when we asked the internet watch foundation why they blocked wikipedia and not amazon , apparently the decision was ' pragmatic ' , which we think means that amazon had money and would sue them , whereas we 're an educational charity . "
access blocked susan robertson , of the iwf , said the image could potentially contravene the protection of children act 1978 .
" we only act on the reports we receive , and as i understand it , the only report we received regarding this content , as of friday , was the content on wikipedia , " she said .
a fascinating case which sheds light on the debate about freedom of speech on the internet rory cellan-jones read more at the dot.life blog ms robertson also said the iwf needed to " take a view " on the images available on amazon with its " analyst team and police partners " .
jay walsh , a spokesman for the wikimedia foundation , which manages the encyclopaedia , said the removal of the page also appeared to have stopped thousands of uk users from editing articles on wikipedia , which allows readers to self-edit its pages .
" it appears that there 's a large number of editors - i ca n't say all - who appear to have access issues , " he said .
the iwf spokeswoman said a reader had brought the image to the foundation 's attention last week and it had contacted the police before adding the page to their list .
wikipedia is one of the world 's most popular websites .

the blocked page of the online encyclopaedia shows an album cover of german heavy metal band scorpions , released in 1976 .
internet providers acted after online watchdog the internet watch foundation warned them its picture may be illegal .
the iwf said it was a " potentially illegal child sexual abuse image " .
some volunteers who run wikipedia said it was not for the foundation to censor one of the web 's most popular sites .
they also argued that the image was available in a number of books and had never been ruled illegal .
but the iwf , which warns internet providers about possible images that could be linked to child abuse , said it had consulted the police before making its decision .
the foundation 's list of proscribed sites is widely used by british internet service providers to filter out images showing child abuse and other illegal content .
it 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site david gerard , wikipedia volunteer as a result , the addition of the scorpions wikipedia page has made it inaccessible to the majority of british internet users .
the iwf , which lists the bbc , news international and internet companies aol -lrb- uk -rrb- and ask among its members , said as many as 95 % of british users would now be unable to access the page .
wikipedia volunteer david gerard said he and fellow users were angry that as well as the photo , the text on the page had been blocked .
" blocking text is a whole new thing - it 's the first time they 've done this on such a visible site , " he said .
mr gerard also told bbc radio 4 's today programme the album cover was still available as part of the band 's box set and could be viewed on retail websites .
" when we asked the internet watch foundation why they blocked wikipedia and not amazon , apparently the decision was ' pragmatic ' , which we think means that amazon had money and would sue them , whereas we 're an educational charity . "
access blocked susan robertson , of the iwf , said the image could potentially contravene the protection of children act 1978 .
" we only act on the reports we receive , and as i understand it , the only report we received regarding this content , as of friday , was the content on wikipedia , " she said .
a fascinating case which sheds light on the debate about freedom of speech on the internet rory cellan-jones read more at the dot.life blog ms robertson also said the iwf needed to " take a view " on the images available on amazon with its " analyst team and police partners " .
jay walsh , a spokesman for the wikimedia foundation , which manages the encyclopaedia , said the removal of the page also appeared to have stopped thousands of uk users from editing articles on wikipedia , which allows readers to self-edit its pages .
" it appears that there 's a large number of editors - i ca n't say all - who appear to have access issues , " he said .
the iwf spokeswoman said a reader had brought the image to the foundation 's attention last week and it had contacted the police before adding the page to their list .
wikipedia is one of the world 's most popular websites .

women tell mike thomson how troops attacked them by mike thomson bbc news , central african republic marie trembles as she tells me about the day when jean-pierre bemba 's congolese troops came to her town .
" we heard gun-shots as they went from house to house , " she says in bossangoa in the central african republic .
she struggles to contain her emotions as she recounts how she and her husband cowered next to their children as the awful sounds outside their home drew closer .
" soldiers burst through our door , " she says .
" they told my husband to lie down and then they shot him right there in front of us all .
i fell onto the body of my husband .
" then six of them grabbed me and held me down .
i was raped where i lay on his corpse . "
she adds , gesturing at a lengthy scar that runs across her face : " one man tried to cut my throat but i was struggling so much that he slashed my mouth instead all the way up to my ear . "
it is horrific testimony like this and that of other victims in the central african republic which have led the former congolese warlord jean-pierre bemba to a prison cell in the netherlands .
there he awaits trial at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes - charges he denies .
mr bemba was chairman of an armed group called the movement for the liberation of congo in his homeland , the democratic republic of congo , where he once served as a vice-president .
in 2002 , the then president of the central african republic , ange felix patasse , invited mr bemba and his troops into the country to put down a rebellion against his rule .
death threats i met marie in bossangoa , one of many central african republic towns and villages where mr bemba 's forces are said to have conducted a horrific campaign of murder , rape and torture against civilians .
bossangoa has not recovered from years of fighting in the grounds of bossangoa 's hospital she and more than 20 members of a local support group - both women and men - gathered to tell me how they had been raped by mr bemba 's troops .
all say they are now hiv-positive .
some waited quietly for hours to speak to me .
they thanked me for giving them the opportunity to tell their story .
one woman told me she had fought back against her attackers but was overpowered by five men who each raped her in turn .
" they were really violent and i began to bleed really badly , " she told me .
" after they had gone i waited until the fighting stopped and then made my way to the nearest hospital .
the doctors there operated on me .
" when i came round they said my womb was so badly damaged that they 'd had to surgically remove it . "
we can just talk , this can free us and i think there is nothing as good as to feel free " monique " another woman , who i will call " monique " , said that she and her 15-year-old daughter had fled into the bush when mr bemba 's troops arrived .
but they were caught when hunger drove them to return home in search of food .
" they took us to their base and they started raping us , " she said .
" one of them went with my daughter and afterwards he slaughtered her .
they left me alone then and i ran back to the bush . "
some of those who have given statements to icc researchers have received death threats .
but monique says she is determined to speak out .
" we decided to talk to reveal what happened to us so we do n't have to hide ourselves again , " she said .
" we can just talk , this can free us and i think there is nothing as good as to feel free . "
legal dilemma mr bemba 's arrest is widely regarded as a landmark prosecution in a part of africa where the perpetrators of major human rights abuses have seldom been held to account .
jean-pierre bemba denies committing crimes against humanity it is a development which may give some of the region 's warlords and military strong men pause for thought .
but mr bemba was only detained after he had travelled to europe .
he was picked up in belgium when the icc issued a secret warrant for his arrest .
many of the people i spoke to in bossangoa would like to see others in the dock alongside mr bemba .
among those mentioned is former president ange-felix patasse who brought bemba 's forces in to prop up his regime .
this faces the icc with a dilemma .
mr patasse is one of several senior figures involved in the fragile peace process to end the civil war in the central african republic , who have been accused of serious human rights abuses in recent years .
the group includes individuals within the current government and several rebel groups .
would further arrests - even if they are possible - upset hopes for peace ?
if the government does n't do more to stop the violence here , i dread to think what will become of this country mathias morouba at present the icc will not say if further investigations are contemplated .
among those who are demanding further action is local human rights lawyer mathias morouba who has been assisting the icc to compile evidence of crimes carried out by mr bemba 's soldiers .
in addition to numerous rapes and murders in bossangoa , he says he has identified around 4,000 more cases across the country .
and he believes the outcome of the bemba prosecution will have major implications - whichever way it goes .
" many here witnessed the numerous and terrible atrocities that bemba 's men committed , " he says .
" since that time others have followed their example and murdered people too .
but if bemba is convicted in court many of these people will become afraid .
they 'll know that they could be next if they continue killing and raping .
" but if this does n't happen and the government does n't do more to stop the violence here , i dread to think what will become of this country . "

advertisement women tell mike thomson how troops attacked them by mike thomson bbc news , central african republic marie trembles as she tells me about the day when jean-pierre bemba 's congolese troops came to her town .
" we heard gun-shots as they went from house to house , " she says in bossangoa in the central african republic .
she struggles to contain her emotions as she recounts how she and her husband cowered next to their children as the awful sounds outside their home drew closer .
" soldiers burst through our door , " she says .
" they told my husband to lie down and then they shot him right there in front of us all .
i fell onto the body of my husband .
" then six of them grabbed me and held me down .
i was raped where i lay on his corpse . "
she adds , gesturing at a lengthy scar that runs across her face : " one man tried to cut my throat but i was struggling so much that he slashed my mouth instead all the way up to my ear . "
it is horrific testimony like this and that of other victims in the central african republic which have led the former congolese warlord jean-pierre bemba to a prison cell in the netherlands .
there he awaits trial at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes - charges he denies .
mr bemba was chairman of an armed group called the movement for the liberation of congo in his homeland , the democratic republic of congo , where he once served as a vice-president .
in 2002 , the then president of the central african republic , ange felix patasse , invited mr bemba and his troops into the country to put down a rebellion against his rule .
death threats i met marie in bossangoa , one of many central african republic towns and villages where mr bemba 's forces are said to have conducted a horrific campaign of murder , rape and torture against civilians .
bossangoa has not recovered from years of fighting in the grounds of bossangoa 's hospital she and more than 20 members of a local support group - both women and men - gathered to tell me how they had been raped by mr bemba 's troops .
all say they are now hiv-positive .
some waited quietly for hours to speak to me .
they thanked me for giving them the opportunity to tell their story .
one woman told me she had fought back against her attackers but was overpowered by five men who each raped her in turn .
" they were really violent and i began to bleed really badly , " she told me .
" after they had gone i waited until the fighting stopped and then made my way to the nearest hospital .
the doctors there operated on me .
" when i came round they said my womb was so badly damaged that they 'd had to surgically remove it . "
we can just talk , this can free us and i think there is nothing as good as to feel free " monique " another woman , who i will call " monique " , said that she and her 15-year-old daughter had fled into the bush when mr bemba 's troops arrived .
but they were caught when hunger drove them to return home in search of food .
" they took us to their base and they started raping us , " she said .
" one of them went with my daughter and afterwards he slaughtered her .
they left me alone then and i ran back to the bush . "
some of those who have given statements to icc researchers have received death threats .
but monique says she is determined to speak out .
" we decided to talk to reveal what happened to us so we do n't have to hide ourselves again , " she said .
" we can just talk , this can free us and i think there is nothing as good as to feel free . "
legal dilemma mr bemba 's arrest is widely regarded as a landmark prosecution in a part of africa where the perpetrators of major human rights abuses have seldom been held to account .
jean-pierre bemba denies committing crimes against humanity it is a development which may give some of the region 's warlords and military strong men pause for thought .
but mr bemba was only detained after he had travelled to europe .
he was picked up in belgium when the icc issued a secret warrant for his arrest .
many of the people i spoke to in bossangoa would like to see others in the dock alongside mr bemba .
among those mentioned is former president ange-felix patasse who brought bemba 's forces in to prop up his regime .
this faces the icc with a dilemma .
mr patasse is one of several senior figures involved in the fragile peace process to end the civil war in the central african republic , who have been accused of serious human rights abuses in recent years .
the group includes individuals within the current government and several rebel groups .
would further arrests - even if they are possible - upset hopes for peace ?
if the government does n't do more to stop the violence here , i dread to think what will become of this country mathias morouba at present the icc will not say if further investigations are contemplated .
among those who are demanding further action is local human rights lawyer mathias morouba who has been assisting the icc to compile evidence of crimes carried out by mr bemba 's soldiers .
in addition to numerous rapes and murders in bossangoa , he says he has identified around 4,000 more cases across the country .
and he believes the outcome of the bemba prosecution will have major implications - whichever way it goes .
" many here witnessed the numerous and terrible atrocities that bemba 's men committed , " he says .
" since that time others have followed their example and murdered people too .
but if bemba is convicted in court many of these people will become afraid .
they 'll know that they could be next if they continue killing and raping .
" but if this does n't happen and the government does n't do more to stop the violence here , i dread to think what will become of this country . "

a spokesman said iraq welcomed any attempt to hold what he called " criminals accountable for their crimes " .
and the national security adviser , mowaffak al-rubaie said the ' party is over ' for the security contractors working in iraq .
" from january there will be no immunity for these people .
if they violate the law , if they encroach on the local people , they will be liable under iraqi law . "
blackwater , which is responsible for the protection of hundreds of american and other foreign officials in iraq , says the guards ' convoy came under attack from insurgents .
eye witnesses and family members maintain that the shooting was unprovoked .
" i was driving .

my sister grabbed my head to pull me down .
those men , they just kept shooting and shooting .
" they shot in all directions .
at the trees .
at the police hut .
they kept shooting at the first car until it burst into flames . "
in that first car to reach the intersection were mahasin and ahmed al-rubaie , wife and son of dr haythem ahmed al-rubaie .
ahmed was shot , then his mother died from gunfire while she was cradling her son in her arms .
dr rubaie rejected a $ 10,000 -lrb- £ 6,660 -rrb- compensation as an insult and says he has not yet even received an apology .

seventeen-year-old mohammed osama lost his father in the shooting .
he believes the five guards being indicted should be executed .
" they need to get the harshest possible punishment , " he said .
forcing change the issue of armed private security guards operating in iraq remains unresolved , mainly because they protect so many american and other foreign officials working here .
police in nisour square , in the upmarket baghdad suburb where the shooting happened , speak with disdain at the mention of blackwater , one saying that he is concerned for the lives of iraqis while they continue to be here .

it was a symbolic part of negotiations on when and how american forces should leave iraq and at the weekend the top military commander , general raymond odierno , told his troops that all iraqis must be treated with " the utmost honour and dignity " .
dr rubaie does not want the death penalty for the five blackwater guards , but he does want americans to understand that they are not the masters of iraq .

cctv cameras are to be used to film inside culverts in a village to try to find out what caused recent flooding in the area .
houses were damaged and people had to leave their homes in the nant y fedw area of abercynon , in the cynon valley , in september following heavy rain .
rhondda cynon taf council is carrying out an investigation to try to stop them being flooded again .
the culverts will be examined with the cameras over three days via manholes .
debris littered gardens and the downstairs rooms of houses were ruined by water and mud after a manhole " exploded " , sending 1.2m -lrb- 4ft -rrb- of water gushing into homes during the flood .
it came after more than 10cm -lrb- 4in -rrb- of rain within a 48-hour period .
councillor anthony christopher , the council 's deputy leader and cabinet member for frontline services , said : " once our investigations are complete on the number of properties affected , we will determine what we can do to reduce the chances of it happening again .
" we will of course remain in close contact with the residents and bring them up to date with any information that arises as soon as possible . "
heavy rain led to hundreds of flood calls to emergency services across south and west wales at the start of september , with homes evacuated and the rail and road network badly hit .

ba is currently in merger talks with both the australian and the spanish airlines .
qantas chief executive alan joyce said there was a reasonable chance that the deal would not go ahead .
he also revealed that the talks had only been announced because the news had been leaked .
" there 's absolutely no guarantee that a transaction will be forthcoming , " mr joyce said .
whatever happens , qantas will remain majority australian-owned , the vast majority of employees will always be australian , and australia will remain our headquarters alan joyce , qantas chief executive is the worst over for airlines ?
" that 's why i think we felt that the leak was a bit premature . "
he also identified ba 's current pension liabilities , which stand at about £ 1.5bn -lrb- $ 2.2bn -rrb- as a possible hurdle for the talks .
the talks come amid growing consolidation in the troubled aviation industry which is suffering as the global financial and economic crisis is hitting demand for air travel .
consolidation after the news was leaked last week , the firms confirmed that they were considering a merger through the creation of a dual-listed company , so it would be listed in london and australia .
however , no other details were disclosed .
mr joyce sought to allay the concerns of some qantas investors and the australian government that the majority of the company 's shares would be held by australian investors .
under current australian law , qantas must be at least 51 % australian-owned .

ba is currently in merger talks with both the australian and the spanish airlines .
qantas chief executive alan joyce said there was a reasonable chance that the deal would not go ahead .
he also revealed that the talks had only been announced because the news had been leaked .
" there 's absolutely no guarantee that a transaction will be forthcoming , " mr joyce said .
whatever happens , qantas will remain majority australian-owned , the vast majority of employees will always be australian , and australia will remain our headquarters alan joyce , qantas chief executive is the worst over for airlines ?
" that 's why i think we felt that the leak was a bit premature . "
he also identified ba 's current pension liabilities , which stand at about £ 1.5bn -lrb- $ 2.2bn -rrb- as a possible hurdle for the talks .
the talks come amid growing consolidation in the troubled aviation industry which is suffering as the global financial and economic crisis is hitting demand for air travel .
consolidation after the news was leaked last week , the firms confirmed that they were considering a merger through the creation of a dual-listed company , so it would be listed in london and australia .
however , no other details were disclosed .
mr joyce sought to allay the concerns of some qantas investors and the australian government that the majority of the company 's shares would be held by australian investors .
under current australian law , qantas must be at least 51 % australian-owned .
any individual foreign airline can only own up to 25 % of qantas , and only a total of 35 % may be owned by foreign airlines .
" whatever happens , qantas will remain majority australian -wned , the vast majority of employees will always be australian , and australia will remain our headquarters , " mr joyce said .
