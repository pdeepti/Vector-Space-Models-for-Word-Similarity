it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .

but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .

taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .

the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .
" we in the international community must come together as part of a truly comprehensive approach -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .

craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .

" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .
low social mobility , bad pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even wealthy german cities have poverty germany is one of the most affected , along with canada , norway and the united states .
greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .
rescue package to help wider economy the government last week pushed through a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 650 billion -rrb- rescue package for banks , though steg was keen to stress that the package would also support the wider economy , not just struggling lenders .
but some experts are worried that the package alone will not be enough to stave off a crippling recession , especially given that germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , warned that the global slowdown is already impacting the country , writing in its october report that the economy likely stagnated in the third quarter . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economy minister michael glos said tuesday that he wants investment bankers to forego their bonuses as a way to acknowledge the damage they caused in the current financial crisis . " a bit more humility would look good in the faces of those bankers who are responsible for the crisis , " glos told the regional newspaper passauer neue presse in an interview .
" a sign of penitence and change would perhaps help restore some of the confidence lost in banks and their managers , " he added .
following deutsche bank 's lead deutsche bank head josef ackermann recently announced he would give up his annual bonus of several million euros to show solidarity with his staff .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .
rescue package to help wider economy the government last week pushed through a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 650 billion -rrb- rescue package for banks , though steg was keen to stress that the package would also support the wider economy , not just struggling lenders .
but some experts are worried that the package alone will not be enough to stave off a crippling recession , especially given that germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports .

21 . the bailout " will allow for the restructuring of the bank , while the significant scaling back of ikb 's activities will limit the distortion of competition created by the state support , " the european commission said . ikb hit the headlines in july 2007 as the first major german bank to run into trouble because it had invested heavily into the us market for poorly secured housing loans known as sub-prime mortgages . bank sold to lone star to keep the bank afloat , its major shareholder , state-owned bank kfw , joined with three banking associations to offer up to 9 billion euros in liquidity and risk protection . those measures caught the eye of the commission , which is tasked with overseeing the eu 's strict rules on fair competition .
on feb .
27 , commission officials launched a probe into the rescue . in august , however , ikb was sold to the us-based investment fund lone star as part of a state-backed restructuring plan . under eu rules , state aid to companies in distress is allowed , but only if it restores the firm to long-term viability , including by making cuts in its activities , and is accompanied by a major investment by the rescued firm itself . the commission decided that " the restructuring plan -lrb- is -rrb- capable of restoring the bank 's long-term viability by refocusing its activity on core business , abandoning loss-making activities and improving cost and risk efficiency , " the statement said . the sale to lone star was seen as a significant contribution to the restructuring , while the reduction in ikb 's activities " limits the distortions on the market created by the economic advantage it received through the state support , " the statement said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 21.10.2008 german artists defend copyright in google era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether google is abiding by its slogan " do n't be evil " google might reign as the unchallenged king of german search engines , but a lawsuit over the company 's popular image search feature brings into question the rights of german artists in the internet age . michael bernhard makes his living photographing celebrities and models for german magazines .
exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .
" we in the international community must come together as part of a truly comprehensive approach -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- .

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .
low social mobility , bad pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even wealthy german cities have poverty germany is one of the most affected , along with canada , norway and the united states .
greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths . # b # the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

noticeably absent from the meeting were luxembourg , austria and switzerland , which had boycotted the gathering .

french budget minister eric woerth said , " banking secrecy has its limits .
switzerland has made progress ... but we must take matters farther . "

21 . the bailout " will allow for the restructuring of the bank , while the significant scaling back of ikb 's activities will limit the distortion of competition created by the state support , " the european commission said . ikb hit the headlines in july 2007 as the first major german bank to run into trouble because it had invested heavily into the us market for poorly secured housing loans known as sub-prime mortgages . bank sold to lone star to keep the bank afloat , its major shareholder , state-owned bank kfw , joined with three banking associations to offer up to 9 billion euros in liquidity and risk protection . those measures caught the eye of the commission , which is tasked with overseeing the eu 's strict rules on fair competition .
on feb .

this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .

the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "

stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .
low social mobility , bad pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even wealthy german cities have poverty germany is one of the most affected , along with canada , norway and the united states .
greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .
prime minister geir haarde has said he hoped for an announcement this week . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 21.10.2008 german artists defend copyright in google era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether google is abiding by its slogan " do n't be evil " google might reign as the unchallenged king of german search engines , but a lawsuit over the company 's popular image search feature brings into question the rights of german artists in the internet age . michael bernhard makes his living photographing celebrities and models for german magazines .
exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

namibia 's government is calling on germany to return dozens of skulls stored in german universities since the colonial era . the namibian government in a statement on tuesday , oct .
21 , said it wants germany " to pay for the repatriation of the remains and all related costs . " the skulls are those of indigenous ovaherero , known also as herero , and nama victims of the uprising of the tribes against german colonial rule between 1904 and 1908 . thousands of indigenous people perished as a result of the extermination order of the chief of the german colonial armed forces or schutztruppe , general lothar von trotha . numerous prisoners of war died in concentration camps in windhoek , swakopmund and luderitz .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market .

sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .
low social mobility , bad pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even wealthy german cities have poverty germany is one of the most affected , along with canada , norway and the united states .
greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .

exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .

of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .

us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .

" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .
rescue package to help wider economy the government last week pushed through a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 650 billion -rrb- rescue package for banks , though steg was keen to stress that the package would also support the wider economy , not just struggling lenders .
but some experts are worried that the package alone will not be enough to stave off a crippling recession , especially given that germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , warned that the global slowdown is already impacting the country , writing in its october report that the economy likely stagnated in the third quarter . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.10.2008 fate of north korea remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has not appeared in public since august recent reports in a japanese newspaper that north korea would make an official announcement regarding the health of kim jong il seem to have been mere rumours .
but what exactly is going on in north korea ?
the leader has not appeared in public since mid-august , fuelling speculation that he could be very ill . " i think that it is unlikely that any government coming after kim jong il would be more than a transitional government towards an ultimate scenario of korean reunification , ” says marcus noland , a north korea expert at the peterson institute in washington dc .
he is currently very much in demand - speculation about the isolated country and its notorious leader kim jong il refuses to subside .
not much can be said about north korea with absolute certainty .
except that it is the world ’ s last staunchly socialist authoritarian regime .
kim jong il appears rarely in public - supposedly for fear of terrorist attacks .
the last publicly-circulated photos of him date back to 14 .
august when he inspected a military unit .
he did not appear for the country ’ s 60th anniversary celebrations nor for the arirang performances .
unclear post-kim jong il scenario the south korean secret services later said he had had a stroke and was recovering .
but north korea denied these claims .
nobody really knows whether kim jong il is in good or bad health or even alive .
it is unclear what might happen if he is dead .
" there are basically three centres of power in north korea , ” explains nolan .
“ one is the family , one is the party , one is the military .
there are clearly rivalries within the family ; there are factions within the party .
what i don ’ t know about is to what extent there are factions within the military .
but there appear to be at least some coalitions across those groups , which makes prediction about how a post-kim jong il transition would sort itself out very difficult . ”
but nolan is not necessarily optimistic about the fate of the country , which declared itself to be a nuclear power after test-firing missiles in 2006 : " the worst case is that those rivalries and those competitions within and among those power centres actually degenerates into armed conflict and one of the things that one has to keep in mind about north korea it is the world ’ s most heavily militarised society . ”
pressing on with disarmament negotiations right now , the country is developing long-distance missiles , which could reach targets in europe and the us .
this is why the us is intent on continuing disarmament negotiations regardless of kim jong il ’ s health .
earlier this month , north korea was struck off the list of terrorist states after the us envoy in pyongyang cleared up some controversial points .
this is a sign that there is still a functioning decision-making structure in north korea and that whether kim jong il is dead or alive , the international community still has a negotiating partner in north korea . dw staff 21/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

but what exactly is going on in north korea ?
the leader has not appeared in public since mid-august , fuelling speculation that he could be very ill . " i think that it is unlikely that any government coming after kim jong il would be more than a transitional government towards an ultimate scenario of korean reunification , ” says marcus noland , a north korea expert at the peterson institute in washington dc .
he is currently very much in demand - speculation about the isolated country and its notorious leader kim jong il refuses to subside .
not much can be said about north korea with absolute certainty .
except that it is the world ’ s last staunchly socialist authoritarian regime .
kim jong il appears rarely in public - supposedly for fear of terrorist attacks .
the last publicly-circulated photos of him date back to 14 .
august when he inspected a military unit .
he did not appear for the country ’ s 60th anniversary celebrations nor for the arirang performances .
unclear post-kim jong il scenario the south korean secret services later said he had had a stroke and was recovering .
but north korea denied these claims .
nobody really knows whether kim jong il is in good or bad health or even alive .
it is unclear what might happen if he is dead .
" there are basically three centres of power in north korea , ” explains nolan .
“ one is the family , one is the party , one is the military .
there are clearly rivalries within the family ; there are factions within the party .
what i don ’ t know about is to what extent there are factions within the military .
but there appear to be at least some coalitions across those groups , which makes prediction about how a post-kim jong il transition would sort itself out very difficult . ”
but nolan is not necessarily optimistic about the fate of the country , which declared itself to be a nuclear power after test-firing missiles in 2006 : " the worst case is that those rivalries and those competitions within and among those power centres actually degenerates into armed conflict and one of the things that one has to keep in mind about north korea it is the world ’ s most heavily militarised society . ”
pressing on with disarmament negotiations right now , the country is developing long-distance missiles , which could reach targets in europe and the us .
this is why the us is intent on continuing disarmament negotiations regardless of kim jong il ’ s health .
earlier this month , north korea was struck off the list of terrorist states after the us envoy in pyongyang cleared up some controversial points .
this is a sign that there is still a functioning decision-making structure in north korea and that whether kim jong il is dead or alive , the international community still has a negotiating partner in north korea . dw staff 21/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic environment an indian ngo is distributing solar lanterns to villagers in the state of maharashtra .

exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .
rescue package to help wider economy the government last week pushed through a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 650 billion -rrb- rescue package for banks , though steg was keen to stress that the package would also support the wider economy , not just struggling lenders .
but some experts are worried that the package alone will not be enough to stave off a crippling recession , especially given that germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , warned that the global slowdown is already impacting the country , writing in its october report that the economy likely stagnated in the third quarter . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 21.10.2008 german researcher : obama will get 52.2 percent of vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly developed forecasting method says obama will be on top a german-american project with a new method for predicting the us election result says barack obama will win in november .
but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .
for a variety of reasons , this could be the hardest election to forecast in us history . most pollsters still concentrate on calling people on landlines around dinner time .
but increasing numbers of americans work flexible hours and communicate using mobile phones .
that might change the candidates ' amount of support from forecasted indications . what 's more , first-time voters usually do n't show up on pollsters ' calling lists , something many observers see as aiding obama if turn-out on election day is high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics in the past have said pollsters have done a mickey mouse job pollsters , however , have no guarantee that respondents are telling the truth , and this year 's election features the first african-american presidential candidate from a major party . that 's led to considerable speculation about whether latent racism might cause some americans to vote differently than their stated intentions when they get in the voting booth . election day will show whether the pollsters have it right this time round or have committed another colossal blunder .
but whatever the result , they 'll be consolation , if needed , in numbers . all the polls currently put obama ahead by 5 percent to 6 points .
if that does n't change in the next two weeks , all the pollsters will either get it right or wrong - together . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .

of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .

questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .

" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .

exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .

of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .

" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .

if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.10.2008 eu commissioner : iceland could gain quick eu entry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safety in numbers - iceland is rethinking its relationship to europe iceland could get on the fast track to eu membership if it so desires , eu enlargment commissioner olli rehn said monday .
iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "

the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 21.10.2008 german artists defend copyright in google era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether google is abiding by its slogan " do n't be evil " google might reign as the unchallenged king of german search engines , but a lawsuit over the company 's popular image search feature brings into question the rights of german artists in the internet age . michael bernhard makes his living photographing celebrities and models for german magazines .
exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .
" we in the international community must come together as part of a truly comprehensive approach -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- .

nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .

but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths . # b # the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined .

peer steinbrueck said the alpine country has refused to cooperate on taxation issues . as countries met to draw up a new " black list " of international tax havens , steinbrueck has advocated adding germany 's neighbor to the list .
" switzerland should be on the blacklist and not the green list " of countries that cooperate on taxation issues , steinbrueck said following a meeting in paris on tuesday , oct .
21 .
the list will cite those countries unwilling to cooperate with international investigators looking for companies and individuals who avoid paying taxes on their incomes by depositing their money in offshore bank accounts .
the issue has been made more pressing because of the global finance crisis .
ministers and representatives from 18 members of the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- met to discuss the problem of tax havens .
noticeably absent from the meeting were luxembourg , austria and switzerland , which had boycotted the gathering .
countries complain of lost tax revenue tuesday 's conference was convened by france and germany .
the french government estimates that its annual budget is deprived of between 30 to 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 40-53 billion -rrb- because of offshore tax havens .
french budget minister eric woerth said , " banking secrecy has its limits .
switzerland has made progress ... but we must take matters farther . "
steinbruck said that tax evasion also poses social problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 21.10.2008 german artists defend copyright in google era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether google is abiding by its slogan " do n't be evil " google might reign as the unchallenged king of german search engines , but a lawsuit over the company 's popular image search feature brings into question the rights of german artists in the internet age . michael bernhard makes his living photographing celebrities and models for german magazines .
exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .

we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .
for a variety of reasons , this could be the hardest election to forecast in us history . most pollsters still concentrate on calling people on landlines around dinner time .
but increasing numbers of americans work flexible hours and communicate using mobile phones .
that might change the candidates ' amount of support from forecasted indications . what 's more , first-time voters usually do n't show up on pollsters ' calling lists , something many observers see as aiding obama if turn-out on election day is high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics in the past have said pollsters have done a mickey mouse job pollsters , however , have no guarantee that respondents are telling the truth , and this year 's election features the first african-american presidential candidate from a major party . that 's led to considerable speculation about whether latent racism might cause some americans to vote differently than their stated intentions when they get in the voting booth . election day will show whether the pollsters have it right this time round or have committed another colossal blunder .
but whatever the result , they 'll be consolation , if needed , in numbers . all the polls currently put obama ahead by 5 percent to 6 points .
if that does n't change in the next two weeks , all the pollsters will either get it right or wrong - together . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .
for a variety of reasons , this could be the hardest election to forecast in us history . most pollsters still concentrate on calling people on landlines around dinner time .
but increasing numbers of americans work flexible hours and communicate using mobile phones .
that might change the candidates ' amount of support from forecasted indications . what 's more , first-time voters usually do n't show up on pollsters ' calling lists , something many observers see as aiding obama if turn-out on election day is high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics in the past have said pollsters have done a mickey mouse job pollsters , however , have no guarantee that respondents are telling the truth , and this year 's election features the first african-american presidential candidate from a major party . that 's led to considerable speculation about whether latent racism might cause some americans to vote differently than their stated intentions when they get in the voting booth . election day will show whether the pollsters have it right this time round or have committed another colossal blunder .
but whatever the result , they 'll be consolation , if needed , in numbers . all the polls currently put obama ahead by 5 percent to 6 points .
if that does n't change in the next two weeks , all the pollsters will either get it right or wrong - together . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market .

sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .

" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .

21 . the bailout " will allow for the restructuring of the bank , while the significant scaling back of ikb 's activities will limit the distortion of competition created by the state support , " the european commission said . ikb hit the headlines in july 2007 as the first major german bank to run into trouble because it had invested heavily into the us market for poorly secured housing loans known as sub-prime mortgages . bank sold to lone star to keep the bank afloat , its major shareholder , state-owned bank kfw , joined with three banking associations to offer up to 9 billion euros in liquidity and risk protection . those measures caught the eye of the commission , which is tasked with overseeing the eu 's strict rules on fair competition .
on feb .
27 , commission officials launched a probe into the rescue . in august , however , ikb was sold to the us-based investment fund lone star as part of a state-backed restructuring plan . under eu rules , state aid to companies in distress is allowed , but only if it restores the firm to long-term viability , including by making cuts in its activities , and is accompanied by a major investment by the rescued firm itself . the commission decided that " the restructuring plan -lrb- is -rrb- capable of restoring the bank 's long-term viability by refocusing its activity on core business , abandoning loss-making activities and improving cost and risk efficiency , " the statement said . the sale to lone star was seen as a significant contribution to the restructuring , while the reduction in ikb 's activities " limits the distortions on the market created by the economic advantage it received through the state support , " the statement said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .
rescue package to help wider economy the government last week pushed through a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 650 billion -rrb- rescue package for banks , though steg was keen to stress that the package would also support the wider economy , not just struggling lenders .
but some experts are worried that the package alone will not be enough to stave off a crippling recession , especially given that germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , warned that the global slowdown is already impacting the country , writing in its october report that the economy likely stagnated in the third quarter . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.10.2008 fate of north korea remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has not appeared in public since august recent reports in a japanese newspaper that north korea would make an official announcement regarding the health of kim jong il seem to have been mere rumours .
but what exactly is going on in north korea ?
the leader has not appeared in public since mid-august , fuelling speculation that he could be very ill . " i think that it is unlikely that any government coming after kim jong il would be more than a transitional government towards an ultimate scenario of korean reunification , ” says marcus noland , a north korea expert at the peterson institute in washington dc .
he is currently very much in demand - speculation about the isolated country and its notorious leader kim jong il refuses to subside .
not much can be said about north korea with absolute certainty .
except that it is the world ’ s last staunchly socialist authoritarian regime .
kim jong il appears rarely in public - supposedly for fear of terrorist attacks .
the last publicly-circulated photos of him date back to 14 .
august when he inspected a military unit .
he did not appear for the country ’ s 60th anniversary celebrations nor for the arirang performances .
unclear post-kim jong il scenario the south korean secret services later said he had had a stroke and was recovering .
but north korea denied these claims .
nobody really knows whether kim jong il is in good or bad health or even alive .
it is unclear what might happen if he is dead .
" there are basically three centres of power in north korea , ” explains nolan .
“ one is the family , one is the party , one is the military .
there are clearly rivalries within the family ; there are factions within the party .
what i don ’ t know about is to what extent there are factions within the military .
but there appear to be at least some coalitions across those groups , which makes prediction about how a post-kim jong il transition would sort itself out very difficult . ”
but nolan is not necessarily optimistic about the fate of the country , which declared itself to be a nuclear power after test-firing missiles in 2006 : " the worst case is that those rivalries and those competitions within and among those power centres actually degenerates into armed conflict and one of the things that one has to keep in mind about north korea it is the world ’ s most heavily militarised society . ”
pressing on with disarmament negotiations right now , the country is developing long-distance missiles , which could reach targets in europe and the us .
this is why the us is intent on continuing disarmament negotiations regardless of kim jong il ’ s health .
earlier this month , north korea was struck off the list of terrorist states after the us envoy in pyongyang cleared up some controversial points .
this is a sign that there is still a functioning decision-making structure in north korea and that whether kim jong il is dead or alive , the international community still has a negotiating partner in north korea . dw staff 21/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .
low social mobility , bad pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even wealthy german cities have poverty germany is one of the most affected , along with canada , norway and the united states .
greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .

the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .

this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 21.10.2008 german researcher : obama will get 52.2 percent of vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly developed forecasting method says obama will be on top a german-american project with a new method for predicting the us election result says barack obama will win in november .
but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .
for a variety of reasons , this could be the hardest election to forecast in us history . most pollsters still concentrate on calling people on landlines around dinner time .
but increasing numbers of americans work flexible hours and communicate using mobile phones .
that might change the candidates ' amount of support from forecasted indications . what 's more , first-time voters usually do n't show up on pollsters ' calling lists , something many observers see as aiding obama if turn-out on election day is high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics in the past have said pollsters have done a mickey mouse job pollsters , however , have no guarantee that respondents are telling the truth , and this year 's election features the first african-american presidential candidate from a major party . that 's led to considerable speculation about whether latent racism might cause some americans to vote differently than their stated intentions when they get in the voting booth . election day will show whether the pollsters have it right this time round or have committed another colossal blunder .
but whatever the result , they 'll be consolation , if needed , in numbers . all the polls currently put obama ahead by 5 percent to 6 points .
if that does n't change in the next two weeks , all the pollsters will either get it right or wrong - together . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the skulls are those of indigenous ovaherero , known also as herero , and nama victims of the uprising of the tribes against german colonial rule between 1904 and 1908 . thousands of indigenous people perished as a result of the extermination order of the chief of the german colonial armed forces or schutztruppe , general lothar von trotha . numerous prisoners of war died in concentration camps in windhoek , swakopmund and luderitz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 21.10.2008 german artists defend copyright in google era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some question whether google is abiding by its slogan " do n't be evil " google might reign as the unchallenged king of german search engines , but a lawsuit over the company 's popular image search feature brings into question the rights of german artists in the internet age . michael bernhard makes his living photographing celebrities and models for german magazines .
exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 21.10.2008 german researcher : obama will get 52.2 percent of vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly developed forecasting method says obama will be on top a german-american project with a new method for predicting the us election result says barack obama will win in november .
but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined . " it is not possible for the euro zone to continue without clearly identified economic government , " sarkozy told the parliament . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?

is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths . # b # the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .
" we in the international community must come together as part of a truly comprehensive approach -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .

" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .

the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .

" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .

google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .

namibia 's government is calling on germany to return dozens of skulls stored in german universities since the colonial era . the namibian government in a statement on tuesday , oct .
21 , said it wants germany " to pay for the repatriation of the remains and all related costs . " the skulls are those of indigenous ovaherero , known also as herero , and nama victims of the uprising of the tribes against german colonial rule between 1904 and 1908 . thousands of indigenous people perished as a result of the extermination order of the chief of the german colonial armed forces or schutztruppe , general lothar von trotha . numerous prisoners of war died in concentration camps in windhoek , swakopmund and luderitz .
the german scientist eugen fischer had requested skulls of the dead for research to support his theory of the superiority of the european brain over that of the african . universities have not responded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the herero want the skulls returned for burial at the end of july , the german public television channel ard reported that the berlin charite medical center alone had an inventory listing 47 skulls from the former german colony . a request for repatriation of the skulls by namibia 's ambassador in germany had fallen on deaf ears with the universities of berlin and freiburg .
the archive of freiburg university defended the collection of human skulls and bones as " cultural heritage , " while the charite said it did not have enough manpower to review its collection . traditional chiefs of the ovaherero and the nama asked the namibian government a couple of weeks ago to facilitate their request for a return of the skulls , which are to be accorded a heroes burial at heroes ' acre outside the capital windhoek . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 21.10.2008 german researcher : obama will get 52.2 percent of vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a newly developed forecasting method says obama will be on top a german-american project with a new method for predicting the us election result says barack obama will win in november .
but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .
for a variety of reasons , this could be the hardest election to forecast in us history . most pollsters still concentrate on calling people on landlines around dinner time .
but increasing numbers of americans work flexible hours and communicate using mobile phones .
that might change the candidates ' amount of support from forecasted indications . what 's more , first-time voters usually do n't show up on pollsters ' calling lists , something many observers see as aiding obama if turn-out on election day is high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics in the past have said pollsters have done a mickey mouse job pollsters , however , have no guarantee that respondents are telling the truth , and this year 's election features the first african-american presidential candidate from a major party . that 's led to considerable speculation about whether latent racism might cause some americans to vote differently than their stated intentions when they get in the voting booth . election day will show whether the pollsters have it right this time round or have committed another colossal blunder .
but whatever the result , they 'll be consolation , if needed , in numbers . all the polls currently put obama ahead by 5 percent to 6 points .
if that does n't change in the next two weeks , all the pollsters will either get it right or wrong - together . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .
the system failed to predict the winners in 1976 and 1980 due , the report said , to the small number of polls available for evaluation . their current prognostication is in line with the " poll of polls " averages used by many popular political web sites in america .
they show obama maintaining a lead of up to 6 percent . political curveballs ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 538 method has its roots in baseball stats but there is considerable reason for skepticism given pollsters ' relatively poor recent track records . to try and combat inaccuracies within surveying systems , americans nate silver and sean quinn have begun using methods from baseball , arguable the most statistic-obsessed and american of sports . one core of their idea is distinguishing between the various established national polls . " we assign each poll a weighting based on that pollster 's historical track record , the poll 's sample size , and the recentness of the poll , " the pair state on their web site .
" more reliable polls are weighted more heavily in our averages . " silver and quinn 's site , fivethirtyeight.com , is named after the number of delegates to the american electoral college , and their predictions focus on the likely number of those delegates for each of the candidates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in 2000 delegates , not percentage of the popular vote , elect the american president . silver and quinn had obama up on wednesday , oct .
22 , by a margin of 5.2 percent and winning the electoral college by a whopping 150 delegates .
they also calculated the chances of him winning the election at 88.4 percent . x-factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changes in lifestyle and technology make a pollster 's job even tougher still , life is n't easy for political prognosticators .
for a variety of reasons , this could be the hardest election to forecast in us history . most pollsters still concentrate on calling people on landlines around dinner time .
but increasing numbers of americans work flexible hours and communicate using mobile phones .
that might change the candidates ' amount of support from forecasted indications . what 's more , first-time voters usually do n't show up on pollsters ' calling lists , something many observers see as aiding obama if turn-out on election day is high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics in the past have said pollsters have done a mickey mouse job pollsters , however , have no guarantee that respondents are telling the truth , and this year 's election features the first african-american presidential candidate from a major party . that 's led to considerable speculation about whether latent racism might cause some americans to vote differently than their stated intentions when they get in the voting booth . election day will show whether the pollsters have it right this time round or have committed another colossal blunder .
but whatever the result , they 'll be consolation , if needed , in numbers . all the polls currently put obama ahead by 5 percent to 6 points .
if that does n't change in the next two weeks , all the pollsters will either get it right or wrong - together . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what exactly is going on in north korea ?
the leader has not appeared in public since mid-august , fuelling speculation that he could be very ill . " i think that it is unlikely that any government coming after kim jong il would be more than a transitional government towards an ultimate scenario of korean reunification , ” says marcus noland , a north korea expert at the peterson institute in washington dc .
he is currently very much in demand - speculation about the isolated country and its notorious leader kim jong il refuses to subside .
not much can be said about north korea with absolute certainty .
except that it is the world ’ s last staunchly socialist authoritarian regime .
kim jong il appears rarely in public - supposedly for fear of terrorist attacks .
the last publicly-circulated photos of him date back to 14 .
august when he inspected a military unit .
he did not appear for the country ’ s 60th anniversary celebrations nor for the arirang performances .
unclear post-kim jong il scenario the south korean secret services later said he had had a stroke and was recovering .
but north korea denied these claims .
nobody really knows whether kim jong il is in good or bad health or even alive .
it is unclear what might happen if he is dead .
" there are basically three centres of power in north korea , ” explains nolan .
“ one is the family , one is the party , one is the military .
there are clearly rivalries within the family ; there are factions within the party .
what i don ’ t know about is to what extent there are factions within the military .
but there appear to be at least some coalitions across those groups , which makes prediction about how a post-kim jong il transition would sort itself out very difficult . ”
but nolan is not necessarily optimistic about the fate of the country , which declared itself to be a nuclear power after test-firing missiles in 2006 : " the worst case is that those rivalries and those competitions within and among those power centres actually degenerates into armed conflict and one of the things that one has to keep in mind about north korea it is the world ’ s most heavily militarised society . ”
pressing on with disarmament negotiations right now , the country is developing long-distance missiles , which could reach targets in europe and the us .
this is why the us is intent on continuing disarmament negotiations regardless of kim jong il ’ s health .
earlier this month , north korea was struck off the list of terrorist states after the us envoy in pyongyang cleared up some controversial points .

the list will cite those countries unwilling to cooperate with international investigators looking for companies and individuals who avoid paying taxes on their incomes by depositing their money in offshore bank accounts .
the issue has been made more pressing because of the global finance crisis .

as the carnage in afghanistan continues , countries are reluctant to send troops into tough combat areas . " we are demonstrating a political will that is in my judgment sometimes wavering , " said united states general john craddock , the head of us european command and nato 's supreme allied commander for europe .
some nations are reluctant to commit troops to tough combat roles , craddock said .
nato countries ' worries about confronting the violence is hindering progress in dealing with insurgents , the drug trade and corruption , craddock said on monday , oct .
21 in a speech to london 's royal united services institute , a military think tank .
craddock said that some countries refused to fight in southern afghanistan and imposed restrictions on the duties their soldiers could carry out .
that had exposed nato 's failings , he said .
" a brief look at the will of our allies in the mission in afghanistan demonstrates some real shortcomings , " craddock said .
germany under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : craddock , right , worries about nato 's will to fight while he did n't mention germany by name , it is one of the nato countries which has restricted soldiers to the relatively safe northern part of the country .
germany 's mandate also does not allow for combat missions .
even so , two german soldiers and five afghan children were killed in a suicide bombing on monday , showing that widespread risks remain .
this year , 232 international soldiers have been killed in afghanistan , most of them in indurgent bomb attacks .
nato leaders have called for additional troops , but countries have been reluctant to commit .
" it 's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century , " he said .
calls for dialogue craddock also stood up for the view expressed by britain 's outgoing commander in afghanistan , brigadier mark carleton-smith , who recently said that the taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue .
" his comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along ...
the conflict in afghanistan can not be won by military means alone , " craddock said .
" we in the international community must come together as part of a truly comprehensive approach -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- .
the current effort remains disjointed in time and space . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

with two such acts in one day , can the war in afghanistan ever be won , asks dw 's nina werkhaeuser ? german soldiers in afghanistan can be as aware and alert as they like - they 'll still be powerless against suicide bombers .
every afghan that approaches a patrol could potentially be carrying explosives , ready to die along with his or her victims .
so what if there are some kids playing peacefully nearby ?
that 's no guarantee for safety .
monday 's suicide bomber sent five children to their deaths . # b # the taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
the governor of the province spoke of suicide bombers who 'd snuck in from pakistan .
taliban fighters who target nato 's isaf troops and then retreat into the border area to pakistan - such an enemy is difficult to defeat militarily .
it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .
when 10 french soldiers were killed in afghanistan in august , the country was in a state of shock for weeks .
the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .
and the 96 " no " votes in the german parliament last week were also a sign that many mps no longer see any purpose in the mission .
but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .
this permanent danger is making troops even more distrustful and nervous .
when a german soldier shot at a woman and two children , he suspected a suicide bomber in the car that suddenly turned towards the checkpoint he was guarding .
in the past seven years of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , nothing like this had ever happened .
the growing threat is having the effect that soldiers are sticking close to their base camps and avoiding any contact to the civilian population , which then only shows increasing animosity towards the soldiers .
clearly , such a " spiral of alienation " is no help to the reconstruction of afghanistan .
the majority of afghans in the relatively peaceful north are still amiable to the germans , say the generals .
but if even this support starts to dwindle , there will be consequences for the entire nato mission .
it may even be that the fight for a stable , peaceful afghanistan can no longer be won .

but are polls accurate ?
maybe the answer lies in another american pastime : baseball ! american voter surveys have often been off-the-mark in 2008 - most notoriously when pollsters predicted a big obama win in the new hampshire primary , which then promptly went to hillary clinton . andreas graefe of the karlsruhe institute of technology -lrb- kit -rrb- and the university of pennsylvania 's scott armstrong think they have come up with a way of being more accurate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong and graefe said they have the bugs worked out graefe and armstrong 's method is based around collating likely voters ' stated preferences for a given candidate with their responses to questions about key issues . " what 's new about our model is that we analyze all the problems for the country raised by current opinion surveys together with voters ' opinions on who can better solve those problems , " the pair of researchers stated on kit web site . their methodology , called " pollyissues " and " pollypolicies , " predicts a clear , if hardly overwhelming victory for obama with 52.2 percent of the vote over john mccain .
the two researchers are convinced that that will , indeed , be the result . " pollyissues would have correctly picked the winner for seven out of nine elections from 1972 to 2004 , along with providing an idea of the margin of victory , " graefe and armstrong wrote in a june 2008 academic paper .

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined . " it is not possible for the euro zone to continue without clearly identified economic government , " sarkozy told the parliament . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

it 's like an octopus that just keeps growing new arms .
the reservoir of suicide bombers appears to be large - they do n't want any nato soldiers in afghanistan .
nato 's answer to the problem : more soldiers .
only recently , the german parliament decided to send an additional 1,000 bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan , in part because the number of attacks is increasing and german camps continue to have rockets fired at them .
even if nato is n't thinking of a withdrawal , the attackers are managing to sow the seeds of doubt in the soldiers ' home countries .

the dutch have had enough of losing their soldiers in the dangerous southern region of afghanistan , and will soon be pulling back .

but while the decision-makers at home can only fall into rhetorical traps , real minefields - and with them the possibility of injury or death - threaten the soldiers in afghanistan .

namibia 's government is calling on germany to return dozens of skulls stored in german universities since the colonial era . the namibian government in a statement on tuesday , oct .
21 , said it wants germany " to pay for the repatriation of the remains and all related costs . " the skulls are those of indigenous ovaherero , known also as herero , and nama victims of the uprising of the tribes against german colonial rule between 1904 and 1908 . thousands of indigenous people perished as a result of the extermination order of the chief of the german colonial armed forces or schutztruppe , general lothar von trotha . numerous prisoners of war died in concentration camps in windhoek , swakopmund and luderitz .
the german scientist eugen fischer had requested skulls of the dead for research to support his theory of the superiority of the european brain over that of the african . universities have not responded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the herero want the skulls returned for burial at the end of july , the german public television channel ard reported that the berlin charite medical center alone had an inventory listing 47 skulls from the former german colony . a request for repatriation of the skulls by namibia 's ambassador in germany had fallen on deaf ears with the universities of berlin and freiburg .
the archive of freiburg university defended the collection of human skulls and bones as " cultural heritage , " while the charite said it did not have enough manpower to review its collection . traditional chiefs of the ovaherero and the nama asked the namibian government a couple of weeks ago to facilitate their request for a return of the skulls , which are to be accorded a heroes burial at heroes ' acre outside the capital windhoek . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .

german economy minister michael glos said tuesday that he wants investment bankers to forego their bonuses as a way to acknowledge the damage they caused in the current financial crisis . " a bit more humility would look good in the faces of those bankers who are responsible for the crisis , " glos told the regional newspaper passauer neue presse in an interview .
" a sign of penitence and change would perhaps help restore some of the confidence lost in banks and their managers , " he added .

he also said that other senior board members at the bank would follow suit .

ackermann had angered politicians in berlin this week by saying that he would be " ashamed " if his bank were to require a state-financed bailout .
the government called the remarks " unacceptable . "

dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined . " it is not possible for the euro zone to continue without clearly identified economic government , " sarkozy told the parliament . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
namibia 's government is calling on germany to return dozens of skulls stored in german universities since the colonial era . the namibian government in a statement on tuesday , oct .
21 , said it wants germany " to pay for the repatriation of the remains and all related costs . " the skulls are those of indigenous ovaherero , known also as herero , and nama victims of the uprising of the tribes against german colonial rule between 1904 and 1908 . thousands of indigenous people perished as a result of the extermination order of the chief of the german colonial armed forces or schutztruppe , general lothar von trotha . numerous prisoners of war died in concentration camps in windhoek , swakopmund and luderitz .
the german scientist eugen fischer had requested skulls of the dead for research to support his theory of the superiority of the european brain over that of the african . universities have not responded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the herero want the skulls returned for burial at the end of july , the german public television channel ard reported that the berlin charite medical center alone had an inventory listing 47 skulls from the former german colony . a request for repatriation of the skulls by namibia 's ambassador in germany had fallen on deaf ears with the universities of berlin and freiburg .
the archive of freiburg university defended the collection of human skulls and bones as " cultural heritage , " while the charite said it did not have enough manpower to review its collection . traditional chiefs of the ovaherero and the nama asked the namibian government a couple of weeks ago to facilitate their request for a return of the skulls , which are to be accorded a heroes burial at heroes ' acre outside the capital windhoek . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "

" the chancellor spoke out specifically against a vague , traditional , wide-ranging credit and economic program financed by new borrowing , " steg told reporters at a regular news conference .
" but what could be helpful in this situation are very precise , very targeted measures to stimulate investment for certain industries , " he said .
german media reports said measures being floated included stimulating sales of low-emission cars , and giving state guarantees on loans to small- and medium-sized companies .
the proposals need to tick the boxes of being convincing , affordable , and easily implemented , steg said .
they will be included in discussions about the government 's 2009 draft budget , due to finalized next month .
rescue package to help wider economy the government last week pushed through a 480-billion-euro -lrb- $ 650 billion -rrb- rescue package for banks , though steg was keen to stress that the package would also support the wider economy , not just struggling lenders .
but some experts are worried that the package alone will not be enough to stave off a crippling recession , especially given that germany 's economy is heavily reliant on exports .
germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , warned that the global slowdown is already impacting the country , writing in its october report that the economy likely stagnated in the third quarter . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .

greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "

namibia 's government is calling on germany to return dozens of skulls stored in german universities since the colonial era . the namibian government in a statement on tuesday , oct .

" the skulls are those of indigenous ovaherero , known also as herero , and nama victims of the uprising of the tribes against german colonial rule between 1904 and 1908 . thousands of indigenous people perished as a result of the extermination order of the chief of the german colonial armed forces or schutztruppe , general lothar von trotha . numerous prisoners of war died in concentration camps in windhoek , swakopmund and luderitz .

21 . the bailout " will allow for the restructuring of the bank , while the significant scaling back of ikb 's activities will limit the distortion of competition created by the state support , " the european commission said . ikb hit the headlines in july 2007 as the first major german bank to run into trouble because it had invested heavily into the us market for poorly secured housing loans known as sub-prime mortgages . bank sold to lone star to keep the bank afloat , its major shareholder , state-owned bank kfw , joined with three banking associations to offer up to 9 billion euros in liquidity and risk protection . those measures caught the eye of the commission , which is tasked with overseeing the eu 's strict rules on fair competition .

he would also like the eu to establish a new financial oversight institution . french president nicolas sarkozy has called for a partial government takeover of strategically important industries . " we should consider a state fund that would buy up shares of strategic companies that have been devalued , " sarkozy said tuesday , oct .
21 , in a speech to the european parliament .
" when the crisis is over , we could then bring the shares back to the market . " the move would also prevent companies from being snatched up by foreign companies during the financial crisis , he said . " i would n't like european citizens to wake up in a few months ' time and realize that european companies belong to non-european capitals , " he told parliamentarians . european sovereign wealth funds ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crisis would let states buy shares at low prices , sarkozy said sarkozy said these sovereign wealth funds could provide an " industrial response " to the financial crisis .
sovereign wealth funds are state-controlled investment vehicles that are typically controlled by energy-rich countries such as russia and saudi arabia . some european and us companies have worried that the governments could use such funds to advance political agendas . sarkozy said he was " well aware of disagreements " on the subject . " but i can not imagine being told that a united european response was needed for the financial crisis , but not for the economic crisis , " sarkozy said .
" our duty is that in europe we can continue to build ships , aircraft , cars . " berlin has been particularly cautious about taking stakes in private companies and decided to look for industry-specific support programs rather than a general economic rescue package . german economy minister michael glos said sarkozy 's proposal " goes against the successful principles of our economic policy . " " current state intervention in the banking and insurance sector are an indispensable exception so as to prevent a possible breakdown of financial flows and help protect jobs and growth , " glos said in an advance edition of wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" germany remains open to capital from all around the world . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea should be studied more closely . " i am not , in principle , against sovereign wealth funds , " barroso told reporters , but added that the eu " must find common rules if possible " to deal with them . more financial oversight needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to consider additional financial oversight barroso was also reserved in reacting to sarkozy 's idea of establishing a " financial government " for the euro zone .
this new institution , if created , would work alongside the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- to define the euro zone 's economic politics . barroso said he would n't want a new institution giving instructions to the ecb .
germany has previously indicated that it is against such a move , saying that it would undermine the independence of the central bank . paris wants an institution to counter the power of the ecb , although the exact form such an " economic government " would take has never been clearly defined .

iceland is considering joining the bloc to shore up its battered economy . with iceland still scrambling to recover from an economic collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis , rehn has made it clear that the european union is waiting with open arms to welcome the tiny island nation should it want to become a member of the bloc .
" iceland is clearly a democratic european country , " which has " already negotiated perhaps two-thirds " of the criteria needed to join the bloc , he told news agency afp .
" this means that were iceland to pose its candidature , we could quickly complete the negotiations . "
as a member of the european free trade association -lrb- efta -rrb- and the european economic area -lrb- eea -rrb- , iceland can participate in the common market .
but it has resisted joining the eu over fears that it would lose control of its fisheries .
since iceland 's economy and currency collapsed under the weight of the global financial crisis , though , it 's been casting around for several lifelines - one of which is eu membership .
even well-known eu skeptic , einar gudfinnsson , iceland 's fisheries minister , is rethinking his country 's relationship with the eu .
" everyone knows that i am against eu membership , " he said in a radio interview .
" but today , we should think about these questions in a new light . "
inching closer to imf deal another lifeline - in the form of a rescue package from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- - also looks increasingly likely for iceland .
on monday , the financial times reported that iceland would soon announce a 4.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- plan sponsored by the imf and several central banks .
the imf would contribute $ 1 billion , while central banks from the nordic region and japan would chip in the rest of the relief package , the paper said .
over the weekend , six icelandic cabinet members discussed possible terms of a loan from the imf .
commerce minister bjorgvin sigurdsson was quoted as telling the frettabladid newspaper that there was need for a quick solution .
another cabinet member , industry minister ossur skarphedinsson , said that a deal with the imf would help pave the way for loans from other sources .

that makes germany 's children and young adults more at risk to grow up in poverty , the report said . three out of four countries have seen the gap between rich and poor increase during the past 20 years , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
this gap is leading to an alarming increase in child poverty , the oecd said in the report , which was released tuesday , oct .
21 .
the rich have benefitted much more than the poor in the economic growth of recent decades , according to the report entitled " growing unequal : income distribution and poverty in oecd countries . "
the average income of the richest 10 percent of people was nearly nine times that of the poorest 10 percent , the study said .
low social mobility , bad pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even wealthy german cities have poverty germany is one of the most affected , along with canada , norway and the united states .
greece , mexico and britain have seen their gap shrink , the study said .
stagnant wages for low-income families and few opportunities for social mobility were causes for the increasing poverty levels .
the study also concluded that children and young adults were 25 percent more likely to be poor than the population as a whole .
" those around retirement age have seen the biggest increases in incomes over the past 20 years , and pensioner poverty had fallen in many countries , " the study said .
" in contrast , child poverty had increased . "
the oecd said that this was alarming as there is evidence that " child wellbeing is a key determinant of how well someone will do as an adult - how much they will earn , how healthy they will be , and so on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 21.10.2008 fate of north korea remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has not appeared in public since august recent reports in a japanese newspaper that north korea would make an official announcement regarding the health of kim jong il seem to have been mere rumours .
but what exactly is going on in north korea ?
the leader has not appeared in public since mid-august , fuelling speculation that he could be very ill . " i think that it is unlikely that any government coming after kim jong il would be more than a transitional government towards an ultimate scenario of korean reunification , ” says marcus noland , a north korea expert at the peterson institute in washington dc .
he is currently very much in demand - speculation about the isolated country and its notorious leader kim jong il refuses to subside .
not much can be said about north korea with absolute certainty .
except that it is the world ’ s last staunchly socialist authoritarian regime .
kim jong il appears rarely in public - supposedly for fear of terrorist attacks .
the last publicly-circulated photos of him date back to 14 .
august when he inspected a military unit .
he did not appear for the country ’ s 60th anniversary celebrations nor for the arirang performances .
unclear post-kim jong il scenario the south korean secret services later said he had had a stroke and was recovering .
but north korea denied these claims .
nobody really knows whether kim jong il is in good or bad health or even alive .
it is unclear what might happen if he is dead .
" there are basically three centres of power in north korea , ” explains nolan .
“ one is the family , one is the party , one is the military .
there are clearly rivalries within the family ; there are factions within the party .
what i don ’ t know about is to what extent there are factions within the military .
but there appear to be at least some coalitions across those groups , which makes prediction about how a post-kim jong il transition would sort itself out very difficult . ”
but nolan is not necessarily optimistic about the fate of the country , which declared itself to be a nuclear power after test-firing missiles in 2006 : " the worst case is that those rivalries and those competitions within and among those power centres actually degenerates into armed conflict and one of the things that one has to keep in mind about north korea it is the world ’ s most heavily militarised society . ”
pressing on with disarmament negotiations right now , the country is developing long-distance missiles , which could reach targets in europe and the us .
this is why the us is intent on continuing disarmament negotiations regardless of kim jong il ’ s health .
earlier this month , north korea was struck off the list of terrorist states after the us envoy in pyongyang cleared up some controversial points .
this is a sign that there is still a functioning decision-making structure in north korea and that whether kim jong il is dead or alive , the international community still has a negotiating partner in north korea . dw staff 21/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 india scandals india is reeling from a series of scandals related to the commonwealth games .

the leader has not appeared in public since mid-august , fuelling speculation that he could be very ill . " i think that it is unlikely that any government coming after kim jong il would be more than a transitional government towards an ultimate scenario of korean reunification , ” says marcus noland , a north korea expert at the peterson institute in washington dc .
he is currently very much in demand - speculation about the isolated country and its notorious leader kim jong il refuses to subside .
not much can be said about north korea with absolute certainty .
except that it is the world ’ s last staunchly socialist authoritarian regime .
kim jong il appears rarely in public - supposedly for fear of terrorist attacks .
the last publicly-circulated photos of him date back to 14 .
august when he inspected a military unit .
he did not appear for the country ’ s 60th anniversary celebrations nor for the arirang performances .
unclear post-kim jong il scenario the south korean secret services later said he had had a stroke and was recovering .
but north korea denied these claims .
nobody really knows whether kim jong il is in good or bad health or even alive .
it is unclear what might happen if he is dead .
" there are basically three centres of power in north korea , ” explains nolan .
“ one is the family , one is the party , one is the military .
there are clearly rivalries within the family ; there are factions within the party .
what i don ’ t know about is to what extent there are factions within the military .
but there appear to be at least some coalitions across those groups , which makes prediction about how a post-kim jong il transition would sort itself out very difficult . ”
but nolan is not necessarily optimistic about the fate of the country , which declared itself to be a nuclear power after test-firing missiles in 2006 : " the worst case is that those rivalries and those competitions within and among those power centres actually degenerates into armed conflict and one of the things that one has to keep in mind about north korea it is the world ’ s most heavily militarised society . ”
pressing on with disarmament negotiations right now , the country is developing long-distance missiles , which could reach targets in europe and the us .
this is why the us is intent on continuing disarmament negotiations regardless of kim jong il ’ s health .
earlier this month , north korea was struck off the list of terrorist states after the us envoy in pyongyang cleared up some controversial points .
this is a sign that there is still a functioning decision-making structure in north korea and that whether kim jong il is dead or alive , the international community still has a negotiating partner in north korea . dw staff 21/10/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 security menace in india , attacks by the maoists are becoming almost a daily occurence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 21.10.2008 germany needs to get aid priorities right , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus says financially helping nations that ca n't help themselves is money well spent should germany continue to send millions in development aid to booming emerging economies like india or divert it to more needy nations in africa ?
dw-world.de spoke to a liberal politician about aid reflecting reality . leading politicians from germany 's opposition liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- last year called for an end to a 68-million-euro -lrb- $ 90.4 million -rrb- development aid package to china , citing the country 's rocketing economic growth rates and surging exports .
last year , german chancellor angela merkel too called into question german aid to india .
as german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul celebrates 50 years of indo-german development aid cooperation this week in india , dw-world.de spoke to hellmut koenigshaus , fdp development aid policy spokesman , about whether germany 's policy of financially supporting booming emerging economies is still relevant .
dw-world.de : your party favored scrapping german financial aid for china because of the country 's strong economic growth .
last year , german aid to india , another booming asian giant , amounted to more than 300 million euros .
do you think that help is justified ?
hellmut koenigshaus : the fdp has long demanded a new approach towards emerging economies in the field of international development aid .
we believe that countries such as china , india , brazil and others which have strong economic growth and huge foreign reserves , no longer need financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenigshaus has called for a shift in germany 's aid priorities india has long been treated as an equal partner in the west .
there are some in the development aid community who just have n't realized that .
if you speak with business representatives about future markets and opportunities , you realize that india , china and brazil are no different than older industrialized nations .
and that 's why it does n't make sense to pretend that all these economic developments have n't taken place .
does that mean you 're in favor of cutting all aid to india and other emerging economies ?
no , not at all .
what we 're saying is that thanks to its robust economic growth , india is in a position to finance its own anti-poverty projects .
we have to realize that india can fund its own social and development initiatives on the global financial markets .
it 's one of the strongest and most creditworthy countries .
india has also emerged as a strong nation , particularly in the context of the escalating financial crisis , because unlike other countries which are now staring at a mountain of debts , india has enough cash reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's it industry is one of the country 's best-known economic success stories what we need to do instead is to provide help to india and other emerging economies in areas where they ca n't help themselves .
in china , that means above all helping the country build a functioning judicial system and promoting legal reform .
these are things that already exist in india .
india is highly developed in many areas .
but india still needs help in the field of technological know-how and cooperation .
that 's where we should be concentrating our efforts .
much of germany 's current development aid cooperation with india focuses on energy , environment and economic and structural reform .
are those the right priorities ?
yes .
as western donors , we do n't want to be cleverer than india and the indians who bear the responsibility of developing their country .
but we have to realize that there can be no development without energy and infrastructure .
that 's why the focus on the environment , which is particularly at risk in india , is important .
often development takes place at the cost of the environment - we 've seen that happen in china .
sometimes , you can achieve some short-term success in battling poverty but at the same time you 're laying the foundation for future problems which in turn lead to new poverty traps and environmental woes .
that 's why it 's absolutely important for western donors to contribute their own knowledge and experience to help rising countries such as india to avoid the mistakes and flawed policies that industrialized nations made in the past .
despite its dazzling economic rise , india is still home to the world 's largest number of poor people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india still has huge levels of poverty and malnourishment undoubtedly .
we are not suggesting rolling back aid to india to save money .
we want to do more , not less , to implement the un 's millennium development goals .
what we are suggesting instead is that we make our development aid more effective by concentrating on the really needy countries .
if we keep pumping in funds into countries like india , we 're not being fair towards nations in africa and elsewhere that do n't have a similarly strong financial foundation and global clout and which obviously get a smaller slice of the foreign aid pie as a result .
we 've already made a start by reducing the number of countries we help financially to 60 .
and fortunately , the german government has ended its aid for china .
that 's the direction we should be headed in with all other emerging countries which reach the same level of economic development as in china .
at the same time , it 's important that countries such as india and china , which have profited from foreign development aid themselves , work together with industrialized nations to help africa .
india , in particular , has specific experience with rural development and irrigation projects financed by western donors .
it can use this knowledge to help africa .
much like china , india too has increasingly strong business ties to africa .
as an " emerging donor , " india is also extending its own development aid to africa .
is that another reason for you to call for a rethink of germany 's development aid to emerging countries ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's involvement in africa has been met with suspicion in the west yes .
it 's true that india is increasingly a development aid donor itself .
it 's a fact which i appreciate .
at the same time , it does n't make any sense to give financial help to china which is involved financially and technologically in africa .
we might as well give the money directly to africa ourselves .
the same applies to india .
how has india 's landmark civilian nuclear deal with the us , which remains controversial in your party , affected aid considerations ?
as far as the nuclear deal goes , i personally consider it a mistake because india has neither signed up to nuclear non-proliferation treaties nor has it agreed to stick to the control mechanisms to monitor all its sites .
i 'm not saying we should completely scratch development aid to india in the wake of the nuclear deal but i think it once more underlines that india is in a moral dilemma .
on the one hand , india has a lot of money for certain technological developments and they 're using it the way they want .
but it ca n't be that india develops its nuclear capability , space projects and at the same time leaves the fight against poverty within its own borders to the western donor community . we have to tell india as a responsible and respected member of the international community that we need to shift the foundation of our relationship i.e. technological cooperation as far as it 's needed within india and in particularly combined indian and western support outside - especially in africa .
many aid groups fear a slump in germany 's development aid as a result of the global financial crisis .
do you agree ?
at the moment , we expect to be facing several financial burdens which will probably lead to lower tax revenues .
due to the crisis , government spending on a variety of things is likely to increase .
all that could lead to changes in the budget .
in the past , we 've always said that budgetary shortfalls should not affect development aid .
i think that will still be the case .
at the same time , you ca n't rule out a worsening of the situation .
if the economy shrinks , it 's possible it could affect germany 's development aid .
we ca n't say that we 're going to cut pensions in germany so that we can meet our foreign aid goals .
but i do n't believe that the situation is that dramatic . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

exclusivity pays his rent , which means that he does n't want his copyrighted works turned loose on the internet .
so when his photographs kept showing up on google image search , which indexes and displays pictures as small thumbnails , bernhard went to his attorney , matthies van eendenburg .
" to me it seems to be pretty clear that there is no legal permission for this kind of usage , " van eendenburg told deutsche welle .
" if you spread these pictures around the internet , one of his sources of profit is endangered . "
bernhard , a hamburg resident filed suit in the regional court and won .
in a parallel lawsuit , judges ruled in favor of thomas horn , an artist who wanted his comic figures removed from google image search .
google filed appeals in both cases last week .
" we are optimistic that this ruling is going to be corrected by the appeal court , " google spokesman kay oberbeck told deutsche welle .
oberbeck acknowledged that the stakes are high .
if google does n't win , it could mean the end of image search , as there 's no way that google could look through millions of pictures and sort out the copyright claims , he said .
a nation of google addicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some artists choose not to post pictures on the web about 34 million german internet users conduct searches each month , according to recent data from leading digital pollster comscore .
of those searches , 80 percent were done via google .
it 's this type of market share that has made google rich .
the company , based in the us state of california , was worth $ 23 billion when it went public in 2004 .
yet as it has muscled its way into all realms of web life - e-mail , maps , document sharing , books - google has begun to worry some german and european privacy advocates . google collects and stores information every time a search is performed .
google defends this practice , saying the information helps it improve searching and protects users against fraud , spam and malicious online attacks .
siva vaidhyanathan , a us-based cultural historian and media scholar , is currently writing a book called " the googlization of everything . " he thinks that both the courts and public in europe have taken a more critical view of google than the united states .
" i think google has a tougher audience in europe , " said vaidhyanathan , who has been a leading critic of google 's drive to scan books and put them on the internet .
" it does n't mean they 're going to get every case right but i think it 's good to be more skeptical of google . "
questions of copyright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there anything google ca n't do ?
us courts have upheld search engines ' rights to display thumbnails of pictures .
yet german and us views on internet copyright are very different , experts say .
" in germany a lot of people think that images , texts , photos , are for free because it is on a web site .
but that is really a misunderstanding , " said alexander fischer , an expert in german internet and copyright law .
" just because it 's technically easy to copy does not mean that you 're legally allowed to copy it . ”
in the us , copyright on the internet has evolved differently than in the print publishing world , vaidhyanathan said .
users have to assume that if they put work on the internet , it could be copied against their will , vaidhyanathan said .
" not everything needs to be on the web .
and if you 're terribly concerned about search engines using your material and pushing it in to the public , you should n't put your material on the web . "
google has said that web site owners can easily keep their photos from being included in image searches by adding a simple line of code .
but van eendenburg said that is not enough .
google needs to implement an image search where everyone who wants to be included needs to opt in .
all other pictures would be left out .
taking responsibility and van eendenburg goes even further .
if someone in siberia illegally uploads a copyrighted picture that shows up in google image search , it 's google that should be responsible for tracking down the copyright violator in siberia , van eendenburg said .
" google has to develop the tools to get these picture thieves .
then you have the commercial possibilities together with the commercial risk , " van eendenburg said .
google 's oberbeck points out that the company does not allow advertising as part of its image search and that many companies , such as poster shops , rely on google image search to sell themselves to a broader public . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former energywatch chief executive allan asher told bbc file on 4 that annual bills of around £ 1,200 could be cut by a third or more .
he said more vigorous competition between energy companies and reformed wholesale markets would reduce bills .
but suppliers say customers are already benefitting from competition .
mr asher , who was head of energywatch for five years until it became part of the new consumer watchdog consumer focus in september , argued that household dual-fuel bills could be cut by £ 300 to £ 400 with tougher regulation and market reforms .

the energy markets are already under investigation by the regulator ofgem but mr asher wants a probe by the more powerful competition commission .
" the powers of the competition commission are clearly greater than those of ofgem , " he said .
" they have the capacity - in fact they 're waiting for just a reference and it 's scandalous that it has n't been made yet . "
the energy retail association said : " mr asher does n't provide enough detail to explain how he arrives at this judgement . "
it said a recent ofgem investigation had concluded that " customers are benefitting from vigorous competition and suppliers compete on price and quality of service to win customers " .

the assembly audit committee 's review of the ambulance service said it needed to develop an action plan to deal with this most challenging of issues .
it said the service needed to improve its communication and resolve apparent bullying and harassment issues .
the welsh ambulance services nhs trust had no comment to make until after the report was published on tuesday .
the committee 's review of ambulance services in wales said the trust , which runs the ambulance service across wales , needed to resolve the " significant internal and external challenges " it faced .
it recommended the morale problem was specifically addressed by improving communication between the trust and operational staff and by addressing perceptions of bullying and harassment .
the report also highlighted the problem of control staff not having access to technology , which allowed them accurately to locate ambulances , as a key priority .
the chief executive and the trust board have done well to respond to what has been an extremely challenging time for the organisation david melding am , audit committee chair this issue is hampering improvements in the trust 's response times and the committee has called strongly recommended that the assembly government consider solving this problem as a matter of urgency .
however , the report said the service had taken some positive steps to addressing its problems but some aspects of its performance remained unacceptable - particularly in south east wales .
the report concludes that the trust needs time and space to deliver its modernisation plan which will deal with some of the organisational and systemic challenges it needs to tackle in order to make progress .
committee chair david melding said : " the chief executive and the trust board have done well to respond to what has been an extremely challenging time for the organisation and they have taken good strides under difficult circumstances .
" we are mindful also that many of the challenges facing the trust are due to systemic problems in the way that the health and social care system operates in wales which the trust can not resolve in isolation . "
modernisation plan the welsh ambulance services nhs trust said it would not be releasing a statement on the report .
the trust 's chief executive alan murray is due to appear before the health , well-being and local government committee on wednesday .
an inquiry into the welsh ambulance services nhs trust , ordered in 2006 , highlighted many longstanding and severe problems .
it concluded that these problems could be resolved over time resulting in the trust 's response in the form its modernisation plan , time to make a difference , in early 2007 .
the current review was commissioned in late 2007 and was asked to take into the progress of the modernisation plan into account .
earlier this year , health minister edwina hart gave the trust six months to turn itself around , demanding it improve its services and leadership by christmas .

based on recent weak order trends , ti said it now expected earnings per share of 30-36 cents in the last three months of 2008 , below forecasts .
the warning came as the chip firm reported quarterly net income of $ 563m , down from $ 776m last year .
sun microsystems warned it would report a wider-than-expected loss in the final quarter of the year .
as most industries suffer from the global squeeze on credit and a consumer slowdown , so many technology firms are feeling the effects from a drop in demand .
streamlining " our outlook for the fourth quarter is for revenue to decline substantially based on weak order trends over the past few months , " said rich templeton , ti chairman , president and chief executive .
as a result , the dallas-based firm said it had aggressively reduced inventory and would continue to do so until the end of the year .
ti also said it was in talks to sell part of its business of making wireless chips - the division that makes off-the-shelf chips for mobile phone handsets .
it said the move would help it cut costs by more than $ 200m a year .
the dallas-based firm said it would focus on investing in custom-design chips , which are used in many smartphones .
separately , sun said it expected to report a net loss for the final three months of 2008 of 25-35 cents a share , surprising analysts who had expected the firm to post a net loss of 16 cents a share .
" sun and its customers are seeing the impact of a slowing economy , " said chief executive jonathan schwartz in a prepared statement .

out of more than 150 people who attended a meeting at tregurthy village hall on monday night there was only one vote in favour of the scheme .
the eden project said it wants to use the turbine to help it become energy self-sufficient .
earlier on monday anti-wind turbine demonstrators blocked three of the entrances to the eden site .
for a small rural community to have something this large stuck right in the middle of it is just too much councillor matthew luke , wind turbine opponent matthew luke , a local councillor who was at the meeting , said : " the actual size of the wind turbine itself is the main concern for most people .
" over 400ft -lrb- 121m -rrb- is just huge .
" for a small , rural community like this to have something that large just stuck right in the middle of it , whether it 's green energy or not , is just far too much . "
the 127m -lrb- 416ft -rrb- machine would be put on the northern side of the eden site , near st austell in cornwall , if restormel borough council approves it .
environmental charity eden said the turbine would have to be large to be economical and to power the site .
eden chief executive tim smit said the 2 megawatt turbine would cost about £ 3m .
alternative energy he said there were only two options on the site where the turbine could be built , so it was at least 450m -lrb- 1,476ft -rrb- away from the nearest house and would comply with regulations .
one of the sites was in a pit , which would mean the turbine would not be in a good position for catching wind , leaving eden with the one suitable site which already had a small turbine .
he said eden had considered hydro-electric power , further solar and geo-thermal systems .
but none was capable of providing eden 's needs at a price it could afford and " the only realistic alternative " was wind .
mr smit said : " leaving aside eden and our 400ft turbine , history tells us that being dependent on energy from outside your boundaries is a really bad thing .
" if climate change gets worse , we are not going to have the time to put in the technological solutions and many of the people who are arguing against this are in a kind of cocoon . "

out of more than 150 people who attended a meeting at tregurthy village hall on monday night there was only one vote in favour of the scheme .
the eden project said it wants to use the turbine to help it become energy self-sufficient .
earlier on monday anti-wind turbine demonstrators blocked three of the entrances to the eden site .
for a small rural community to have something this large stuck right in the middle of it is just too much councillor matthew luke , wind turbine opponent matthew luke , a local councillor who was at the meeting , said : " the actual size of the wind turbine itself is the main concern for most people .
" over 400ft -lrb- 121m -rrb- is just huge .
" for a small , rural community like this to have something that large just stuck right in the middle of it , whether it 's green energy or not , is just far too much . "
the 127m -lrb- 416ft -rrb- machine would be put on the northern side of the eden site , near st austell in cornwall , if restormel borough council approves it .
environmental charity eden said the turbine would have to be large to be economical and to power the site .
eden chief executive tim smit said the 2 megawatt turbine would cost about £ 3m .
alternative energy he said there were only two options on the site where the turbine could be built , so it was at least 450m -lrb- 1,476ft -rrb- away from the nearest house and would comply with regulations .
one of the sites was in a pit , which would mean the turbine would not be in a good position for catching wind , leaving eden with the one suitable site which already had a small turbine .
he said eden had considered hydro-electric power , further solar and geo-thermal systems .
but none was capable of providing eden 's needs at a price it could afford and " the only realistic alternative " was wind .
mr smit said : " leaving aside eden and our 400ft turbine , history tells us that being dependent on energy from outside your boundaries is a really bad thing .
" if climate change gets worse , we are not going to have the time to put in the technological solutions and many of the people who are arguing against this are in a kind of cocoon . "

alternative energy he said there were only two options on the site where the turbine could be built , so it was at least 450m -lrb- 1,476ft -rrb- away from the nearest house and would comply with regulations .
one of the sites was in a pit , which would mean the turbine would not be in a good position for catching wind , leaving eden with the one suitable site which already had a small turbine .
he said eden had considered hydro-electric power , further solar and geo-thermal systems .
but none was capable of providing eden 's needs at a price it could afford and " the only realistic alternative " was wind .
mr smit said : " leaving aside eden and our 400ft turbine , history tells us that being dependent on energy from outside your boundaries is a really bad thing .
" if climate change gets worse , we are not going to have the time to put in the technological solutions and many of the people who are arguing against this are in a kind of cocoon . "

philip green : " people are not going to stop shopping " retail tycoon sir philip green has said that uk banks made " grave errors " in recent years that contributed to the current credit crisis .
sir philip told the bbc that banks had been too keen to give out loans .
his comments came as his arcadia fashion group - which owns topshop and miss selfridge - reported a 6 % fall in annual operating profits to £ 275.3m.
sir philip also said it was unlikely arcadia would buy uk shops owned by iceland 's baugur for the time being .
' tough market ' have your say as a family , we have n't bought any new clothes for months chris , uk send us your comments while sir philip implied that the current economic downturn was not yet as severe as in the early 1990s - due to the double-digit interest rates at that time - he said retailers were " all going to have to work harder " to weather the storm .

the 56-year-old former libyan intelligence agent has been diagnosed with prostate cancer after hospital tests last month .
solicitor tony kelly said the disease had spread to other parts of his body .
megrahi is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 27 years for the bombing of pan am flight 103 in 1988 , which led to the deaths of 270 people .
last week megrahi won the latest round of his long-running legal battle to overturn his conviction .
he has already lost an appeal against his 2001 conviction but the scottish criminal cases review commission -lrb- sccrc -rrb- ordered another .
list of objections in a 790-page report , the commission highlighted five reasons which led it to believe that megrahi 's conviction might be a miscarriage of justice .
appeal court judges rejected arguments from the crown that only the concerns voiced by the commission should be considered when he appears before them .
megrahi 's legal team asked for its own grounds of appeal to be added and submitted its list , running to 317 pages .
no date has yet been fixed for a hearing which will finally decide whether the guilty verdict should stand .
megrahi 's lawyer said : " following hospital tests , mr megrahi was last month diagnosed with prostate cancer .
" unfortunately the disease has spread to other parts of his body and is therefore at an advanced stage .
" mr megrahi asks that the privacy of his family is respected at this difficult time . "
" i 'm not satisfied that the verdict against him is correct " dr jim swire uk families flight 103 mr kelly added : " he wishes me to make clear that the fight to overturn his wrongful conviction for the lockerbie bombing will go on .
" we on his legal team are continuing to prepare his appeal , which we hope will take place some time next year . "
dr jim swire , whose daughter flora died in the bombing , called for megrahi 's appeal to be speeded up .
he said : " i feel that it is a very serious threat to his life and it would be a tragedy if he is to spend the rest of his life in a scottish prison , particularly if he is not guilty of the crime of which he was found guilty .
" i 'm not satisfied that the verdict against him is correct .
" it sounds to me like an unfolding human tragedy . "
dr swire , who is also spokesman for the uk families flight 103 group , added : " if his prognosis is bad then i hope that the scottish authorities would look for a way of speeding up the next appeal without compromising the fairness of it .
" it would be an act of great humanity to do that . "

abusers are said to often intimidate their victims by threatening pets with violence or injuring or killing them .
but the rspca 's petretreat scheme finds pets safe homes away from this abuse and in the process helps their owners leave abusive relationships earlier .
as part of its domestic abuse inquiry , the assembly government has asked pet foster families to come forward .
the petretreat programme , formerly known as petsafe , started in june 2002 as a pilot project working alongside domestic abuse refuges in the west of england and launched in wales in 2007 .
it helps break the cycle of violence and intimidation associated with abuse by taking pets away out of the domestic abuse situation .
by helping these pets , volunteers enable victims of domestic abuse to get help social justice minister brian gibbons officials say abusers frequently use pets to keep their victims from leaving them , threatening or using violence against their animals .
this frightens many abuse victims into staying put and in turn prolongs the violence against them .
very few refuges also provide shelter for pets due to allergy concerns and health and safety regulations .
the call for pet-friendly families to come forward was made by social justice minister brian gibbons ahead of the assembly 's communities and culture committee hearing evidence on its inquiry into domestic abuse on wednesday .
abuse target " pets are often cherished by victims of domestic abuse , but this often makes the pet a target of abuse , " he said .
" if the victim seeks help the abuser may threaten or hurt the pet .
this is another barrier preventing them from escaping .
" a vital part of this scheme is the volunteer foster families .
people are needed to open their homes to these pets while families are in transition .
" by helping these pets , volunteers enable victims of domestic abuse to get help . "
dr gibbons urged anyone who had space for another pet in their home to contact the rspca 's domestic abuse outreach service and said that in doing so they would help abuse victims start a new life .
the rspca 's claire lawson , added : " with the assembly 's inquiry into domestic abuse due to be completed , we would like to use this as an opportunity to highlight the variety of work undertaken in wales to support the victims of domestic abuse . "

very few refuges also provide shelter for pets due to allergy concerns and health and safety regulations .
the call for pet-friendly families to come forward was made by social justice minister brian gibbons ahead of the assembly 's communities and culture committee hearing evidence on its inquiry into domestic abuse on wednesday .
abuse target " pets are often cherished by victims of domestic abuse , but this often makes the pet a target of abuse , " he said .
" if the victim seeks help the abuser may threaten or hurt the pet .
this is another barrier preventing them from escaping .
" a vital part of this scheme is the volunteer foster families .
people are needed to open their homes to these pets while families are in transition .
" by helping these pets , volunteers enable victims of domestic abuse to get help . "
dr gibbons urged anyone who had space for another pet in their home to contact the rspca 's domestic abuse outreach service and said that in doing so they would help abuse victims start a new life .
the rspca 's claire lawson , added : " with the assembly 's inquiry into domestic abuse due to be completed , we would like to use this as an opportunity to highlight the variety of work undertaken in wales to support the victims of domestic abuse . "

prime minister taro aso had campaigned to keep the mission going , saying japan should contribute to global security .
but many opposition members are against the proposal , saying it breaches the country 's pacifist constitution .
the bill is likely to be rejected in the opposition-controlled upper house , before the more powerful lower house passes it into law .
emotive issue japan 's constitution forbids it from fighting other nations , but in recent years the government has tried to revise the rules to allow for a more robust defence policy .
but the issue is an emotive one , and many mps have argued that japan should not be involved in military operations at all , however tangentially .
japan has refuelled coalition warships in the indian ocean for several years , but the mission was temporarily halted last november because the opposition-dominated upper house refused to vote on the issue .
this time round , though , it has other priorities in mind .
correspondents say that the main opposition democratic party of japan -lrb- dpj -rrb- hopes that by letting the bill pass , there is now no excuse for mr aso to postpone calling a snap general election .
mr aso 's liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- has dominated japanese politics for more than 50 years , but polls show the dpj is now in a strong position to gain seats if an election is called soon .

age concern cymru wants the nhs and the welsh assembly government to provide the low level foot care measures it has outlined in a new report .
the services it is requesting range from basic nail cutting to general chiropody as it says good podiatry is essential to older people 's health .
the assembly government said it recognised the importance of foot care .
age concern said without access to free and comprehensive foot care services older people could become housebound , isolated and susceptible to falls .
chief executive robert taylor said : " by introducing the simple , low level foot care measures outlined in this report , the health service could improve the quality of life for thousands of older people in wales overnight .
' mobility problems ' " at the same time , the welsh assembly government needs to take the lead in recognising the importance of foot care services for older people 's well being and ensure there is equal access to quality services across wales .
" we simply can not afford to let thousands of older people in wales continue to suffer from foot and mobility problems because of a general ignorance about the serious effects of neglecting foot care services . "
the report is based on consultation and research with nhs bodies and local age concern groups .
an assembly government spokesman said : " we can not comment on a report that we have not seen and had an opportunity to study in detail .
" however , the national service framework for older people in wales set standards for the quality of health and social services and fully recognises that the ability to care for one 's own feet decreases with age and highlights the importance of access to effective podiatry services .
" it is for local health and social services organisations to work together and identify local needs and deliver services appropriately . "

the services it is requesting range from basic nail cutting to general chiropody as it says good podiatry is essential to older people 's health .

age concern said without access to free and comprehensive foot care services older people could become housebound , isolated and susceptible to falls .

" we simply can not afford to let thousands of older people in wales continue to suffer from foot and mobility problems because of a general ignorance about the serious effects of neglecting foot care services . "
the report is based on consultation and research with nhs bodies and local age concern groups .
an assembly government spokesman said : " we can not comment on a report that we have not seen and had an opportunity to study in detail .
" however , the national service framework for older people in wales set standards for the quality of health and social services and fully recognises that the ability to care for one 's own feet decreases with age and highlights the importance of access to effective podiatry services .

i know .
i read them all the next day , " says comedian ricky gervais .
the 47-year-old , who is appearing in his first hollywood lead role in movie ghost town , insists he never usually reads what critics have to say .
" honestly , i never usually do that , people would have to put them underneath my nose .
" all i was thinking was ' that 's a good one , that 's a good one , that 's a good one ' .
" then i thought ' oh no there 's going to be one bad one and that 's the one that britain 's going to pick up on .
that 's the one my family is going to read ' . "
the office star plays bertram pincus , a grouchy dentist who dies unexpectedly during a routine operation .
after being revived , he realises he has the ability to see dead people who all want something from him .
the idea of the living being haunted by the dead is not completely original , as the concept has already appeared in several films including over my dead body and sixth sense .
despite that , gervais says he is pleased he signed up for it .
" i 'm proud of it and what i like about it the most is it 's like a throwback .
" it almost feels like an antidote to the erection joke factory that 's coming out of america at the moment aimed at 12-year-old boys . "
gervais reveals that , after accepting the part , he sat down with writer david koepp to make some changes .
' sweeter and emotional ' he says the script originally called for pincus and gwen , played by tea leoni , to kiss at the end .
" what does that mean ?
i just think it 's so easy to do that , that really is like saying that 's the end of the film , " gervais says .
the star , whose favourite romantic comedy is the apartment , recalls one of the final lines in the movie : ' shut up and deal ! ' is also the best part of the climax .
" that shows they 're soulmates , that means so much more , " he says . "
i did this because it 's the best script i 'd read in five years and i love the film " ricky gervais the kiss in ghost town was later replaced with dialogue that gervais hopes is " more sweeter and emotional " .
he adds : " i think people react more on what they feel than what they see and hear .
there 's just something that hits you on a different level with greater emotional content . "
despite that , the movie only reached number eight in the north american box office when it was released in september .
" no-one cares about that opening weekend .
the pressure is to care about it because you can be taken out of cinemas and that would be a shame , but we were lucky , " he says .
" if we had been put in 3,000 cinemas i think we would have been pulled , but because our release was limited and we were doing well they let us stay around for a while . "
cameo film role " it went to number eight and then it stayed in the top 20 for a couple of weeks , it went back up and then it went back in .
it 's hanging around , " he says .
it remains to be seen how gervais 's british fans will take to the movie , but whatever the reaction the actor is glad he took the role .
" i did this because it 's the best script i 'd read in five years and i love the film , " he says .
other than the odd film cameo , gervais has confined his work to television .
he appeared in the 2006 film for your consideration because christopher guest is his " comedy hero " .
in the same year he played dr mcphee in night at the museum as he was " returning a favour " to ben stiller .
and his small part in last year 's movie stardust was accepted because he got to spend two days working with veteran actor robert de niro .
having achieved commercial success in the us , with bafta , emmy and golden globe awards to his name , gervais reveals comedy that " resonates " with people is the key .
" we wanted people to think about it and talk about it the next day . "
he thinks the office worked in the us because it involved " universal themes " .
he adds : " it was about the futility of life , wasting your life , a bad boss , boy meets girl . "
despite the pilot scoring the lowest focus group score ever for bbc two , gervais went with it anyway .
" we did n't change a thing , because if you pan it and water it down you 'll just churn out the same stuff and there 's someone out there who wants something different .
" if you do something that has never been done before , you 'll get a market . "
ghost town is released in cinemas across the uk on friday 24 october .

gervais plays a grumpy dentist who eventually falls in love the office star plays bertram pincus , a grouchy dentist who dies unexpectedly during a routine operation .
after being revived , he realises he has the ability to see dead people who all want something from him .
the idea of the living being haunted by the dead is not completely original , as the concept has already appeared in several films including over my dead body and sixth sense .
despite that , gervais says he is pleased he signed up for it .
" i 'm proud of it and what i like about it the most is it 's like a throwback .
" it almost feels like an antidote to the erection joke factory that 's coming out of america at the moment aimed at 12-year-old boys . "
gervais reveals that , after accepting the part , he sat down with writer david koepp to make some changes .
' sweeter and emotional ' he says the script originally called for pincus and gwen , played by tea leoni , to kiss at the end .
" what does that mean ?
i just think it 's so easy to do that , that really is like saying that 's the end of the film , " gervais says .
the star , whose favourite romantic comedy is the apartment , recalls one of the final lines in the movie : ' shut up and deal ! ' is also the best part of the climax .
" that shows they 're soulmates , that means so much more , " he says .
i did this because it 's the best script i 'd read in five years and i love the film ricky gervais the kiss in ghost town was later replaced with dialogue that gervais hopes is " more sweeter and emotional " .
he adds : " i think people react more on what they feel than what they see and hear .
there 's just something that hits you on a different level with greater emotional content . "
despite that , the movie only reached number eight in the north american box office when it was released in september .
" no-one cares about that opening weekend .
the pressure is to care about it because you can be taken out of cinemas and that would be a shame , but we were lucky , " he says .
" if we had been put in 3,000 cinemas i think we would have been pulled , but because our release was limited and we were doing well they let us stay around for a while . "
cameo film role " it went to number eight and then it stayed in the top 20 for a couple of weeks , it went back up and then it went back in .
it 's hanging around , " he says .
it remains to be seen how gervais 's british fans will take to the movie , but whatever the reaction the actor is glad he took the role .
" i did this because it 's the best script i 'd read in five years and i love the film , " he says .
other than the odd film cameo , gervais has confined his work to television .
he appeared in the 2006 film for your consideration because christopher guest is his " comedy hero " .
gervais is revived back from death but can still see dead people in the same year he played dr mcphee in night at the museum as he was " returning a favour " to ben stiller .
and his small part in last year 's movie stardust was accepted because he got to spend two days working with veteran actor robert de niro .
having achieved commercial success in the us , with bafta , emmy and golden globe awards to his name , gervais reveals comedy that " resonates " with people is the key .
" we wanted people to think about it and talk about it the next day . "
he thinks the office worked in the us because it involved " universal themes " .
he adds : " it was about the futility of life , wasting your life , a bad boss , boy meets girl . "
despite the pilot scoring the lowest focus group score ever for bbc two , gervais went with it anyway .
" we did n't change a thing , because if you pan it and water it down you 'll just churn out the same stuff and there 's someone out there who wants something different .
" if you do something that has never been done before , you 'll get a market . "
ghost town is released in cinemas across the uk on friday 24 october .

he thinks the office worked in the us because it involved " universal themes " .
he adds : " it was about the futility of life , wasting your life , a bad boss , boy meets girl . "
despite the pilot scoring the lowest focus group score ever for bbc two , gervais went with it anyway .
" we did n't change a thing , because if you pan it and water it down you 'll just churn out the same stuff and there 's someone out there who wants something different .

the 47-year-old , who is appearing in his first hollywood lead role in movie ghost town , insists he never usually reads what critics have to say .
" honestly , i never usually do that , people would have to put them underneath my nose .
" all i was thinking was ' that 's a good one , that 's a good one , that 's a good one ' .
" then i thought ' oh no there 's going to be one bad one and that 's the one that britain 's going to pick up on .
that 's the one my family is going to read ' . "
gervais plays a grumpy dentist who eventually falls in love the office star plays bertram pincus , a grouchy dentist who dies unexpectedly during a routine operation .
after being revived , he realises he has the ability to see dead people who all want something from him .
the idea of the living being haunted by the dead is not completely original , as the concept has already appeared in several films including over my dead body and sixth sense .

you 're perched behind a table with only a bottle of water for company .
not just in front of you , but to the left , right and even behind , are about 200 people primed with rhetorical grenades they ca n't wait to fire in your direction .
becoming one of the most important people in world trade does n't come easily .
baroness ashton is the british government 's nomination to replace former european trade commissioner lord mandelson , who 's returned to the uk to become business secretary .
to secure the job , she had three hours to prove one thing - that she 's up to it .
wearing a sombre purple suit , her hands clasped together and smiling nervously , her pitch was simple .
she told meps she was a tough negotiator , strongly pro-european and would make a virtue out of her relative obscurity .
" the question is , do i have the ability to go and negotiate on behalf of the european union , bearing in mind that i want stability and economic growth , " she said .
" the answer is , yes i do .
i am a negotiator .
it is what i do .
i may not have had the profile of the newly-ennobled lord mandelson , but that does not mean that i do n't have the experience .
quite the contrary . "
social conscience she referred repeatedly to her work as an economist , government minister and leader of the house of lords - and also pointed out that she had hundreds of very experienced commission experts at her disposal as she reads her way into her new job .
a returning theme was a commitment to reviving the stalled world trade talks - and doing so with a social conscience .
mr mandelson faced french objections to his stance in the doha talks " i believe globalisation is a force for good .
but i was brought up in lancashire , which used to be the heart of the textiles industry , " she said .
" i know what communities go through when there is huge upheaval .
we have a responsibility to help those affected by the process . "
attempting to strike a balance on just this issue led her predecessor into a public conflict with french president nicolas sarkozy , who accused lord mandelson of trying to force a trade deal on the eu that would destroy european jobs and sell out european farmers in the name of free trade .
how would she deal with such a clash , demanded the pugnacious and direct leader of the united kingdom independence party , nigel farage .
she insisted protecting citizens was important - but not at the cost of economic protectionism and standing in the way of free trade .
quite the opposite , she said .
with the current financial crisis , open markets would be more important than ever .
doha dilemma to that end , her first visit , if she 's confirmed in the job , will be to geneva , the home of the world trade organization .
the so-called doha round of world trade talks , which are currently stalled , are her priority .
" a successful doha round remains absolutely central to eu trade policy .
we have to see whether we can put it back on track , " she said .
and so the questioning went on - and became more specific .
as if answering obscure questions on trading relations with specific south american economies was n't a challenge , merely finding the questioners in the audience was proving tricky enough .
" i wo n't commit to doing something about something about which i know little " - and answers on a similar vein - were as inevitable as they were understandable for someone so new to the post .
not everyone here is convinced she is the best person for the job - but there is an acceptance from many that her bullish if defensive performance , and willingness to listen , is a good sign .
the challenge for her now is to master her incredibly complex brief , quickly .

you 're perched behind a table with only a bottle of water for company .
not just in front of you , but to the left , right and even behind , are about 200 people primed with rhetorical grenades they ca n't wait to fire in your direction .
becoming one of the most important people in world trade does n't come easily .
baroness ashton is the british government 's nomination to replace former european trade commissioner lord mandelson , who 's returned to the uk to become business secretary .
to secure the job , she had three hours to prove one thing - that she 's up to it .
wearing a sombre purple suit , her hands clasped together and smiling nervously , her pitch was simple .
she told meps she was a tough negotiator , strongly pro-european and would make a virtue out of her relative obscurity .
" the question is , do i have the ability to go and negotiate on behalf of the european union , bearing in mind that i want stability and economic growth , " she said .
" the answer is , yes i do .
i am a negotiator .
it is what i do .
i may not have had the profile of the newly-ennobled lord mandelson , but that does not mean that i do n't have the experience .
quite the contrary . "
social conscience she referred repeatedly to her work as an economist , government minister and leader of the house of lords - and also pointed out that she had hundreds of very experienced commission experts at her disposal as she reads her way into her new job .
a returning theme was a commitment to reviving the stalled world trade talks - and doing so with a social conscience .
mr mandelson faced french objections to his stance in the doha talks " i believe globalisation is a force for good .
but i was brought up in lancashire , which used to be the heart of the textiles industry , " she said .
" i know what communities go through when there is huge upheaval .
we have a responsibility to help those affected by the process . "
attempting to strike a balance on just this issue led her predecessor into a public conflict with french president nicolas sarkozy , who accused lord mandelson of trying to force a trade deal on the eu that would destroy european jobs and sell out european farmers in the name of free trade .
how would she deal with such a clash , demanded the pugnacious and direct leader of the united kingdom independence party , nigel farage .
she insisted protecting citizens was important - but not at the cost of economic protectionism and standing in the way of free trade .
quite the opposite , she said .
with the current financial crisis , open markets would be more important than ever .
doha dilemma to that end , her first visit , if she 's confirmed in the job , will be to geneva , the home of the world trade organization .
the so-called doha round of world trade talks , which are currently stalled , are her priority .
" a successful doha round remains absolutely central to eu trade policy .
we have to see whether we can put it back on track , " she said .
and so the questioning went on - and became more specific .
as if answering obscure questions on trading relations with specific south american economies was n't a challenge , merely finding the questioners in the audience was proving tricky enough .
" i wo n't commit to doing something about something about which i know little " - and answers on a similar vein - were as inevitable as they were understandable for someone so new to the post .
not everyone here is convinced she is the best person for the job - but there is an acceptance from many that her bullish if defensive performance , and willingness to listen , is a good sign .
the challenge for her now is to master her incredibly complex brief , quickly .
the difficult questions she 'll face are only just beginning .

she told meps she was a tough negotiator , strongly pro-european and would make a virtue out of her relative obscurity .
" the question is , do i have the ability to go and negotiate on behalf of the european union , bearing in mind that i want stability and economic growth , " she said .
" the answer is , yes i do .
i am a negotiator .
it is what i do .
i may not have had the profile of the newly-ennobled lord mandelson , but that does not mean that i do n't have the experience .
quite the contrary . "

initiatives include a visible police presence on school routes and dedicated officers to work with young people likely to become offenders or victims .
the money will go to the 10 police force areas in the government 's tackling knives action programme .
home secretary jacqui smith said she hoped it would send the message that a knife is not needed for protection .
' family tragedy ' the announcement came hours after a 16-year-old boy was stabbed to death outside a youth club in liverpool .
the teenager was with two friends when he was attacked by a group of youths outside shrewsbury house youth club in everton at 2040 bst on monday .
young people tell us that the period after school can be when conflicts arise and an increase in police presence can help them be and feel safe and secure met deputy assistant commissioner alf hitchcock boy of 16 killed in stab attack ms smith told the bbc that tougher laws and enforcement were already having an effect .
she said : " this is obviously a tragedy for the family up in liverpool , and the reason why we need to keep building on the work that we have undertaken to tackle knife crime .
" all of these things are making a difference .
any young person killed in a tragedy like last night is one too many .
" but we 've got to carry on with the efforts that we 've put in place and to work alongside the community and the police to do that . "
some £ 2m more was announced earlier this year for the 10 areas , which are london , essex , lancashire , west yorkshire , merseyside , the west midlands , greater manchester , nottinghamshire , south wales and thames valley .
' tough approach ' metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner alf hitchcock , head of the tackling knives action programme , said the police presence on school routes would target the time of day when trouble could occur between youths .
" young people tell us that the period after school can be when conflicts arise between different groups and an increase in police presence and in other visible signs of authority can help them be and feel safe and secure , " he said .

" this additional funding will assist the 10 tackling knives action programme forces in further building on the tough approach towards those who carry knives which acpo -lsb- the association of chief police officers -rsb- is leading across the police service . "
shadow home affairs minister james brokenshire said the initiative was too limited in its scope .
he said : " i support any mechanism that will cut the appalling crimes that we 've seen on our streets .
" my concern about this approach is that it 's just too targeted .
it 's saying that the problem is just in certain areas and at certain times of the day , in other words after school .
" tragically , with the incident we saw last night , it did n't happen just after school and it did n't happen just within the vicinity of the school . "
