program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 27.08.2008 expert : eu-russian relations will remain difficult for months großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to review the partnership dw spoke to henning riecke from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- to get his analysis of the caucasus conflict . dw-tv : why did this conflict escalate ?
there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 27.08.2008 top cop : new laws needed to fight organized crime , child porn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia 's bloody business continues in germany but the pressure is on in its annual review on serious and organized crime in germany , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- announced that new laws were needed to combat child pornography and organized crime . the bka 's annual report on organized crime , issued on wednesday , aug .
27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 27.08.2008 expert : eu-russian relations will remain difficult for months großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to review the partnership dw spoke to henning riecke from the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- to get his analysis of the caucasus conflict . dw-tv : why did this conflict escalate ?
there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

" these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity .

" by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 27.08.2008 readers critical of west 's " double standards " in caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers emphasized the growing tension between russia and the west readers shared their views on the roles of the usa , europe and russia in the ongoing stalemate regarding georgia 's breakaway regions . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .
there is an inconsistency here .
why is georgia 's territorial integrity important , but serbia 's not ?
why was kosovo granted independence but not south ossetia ?
if the un and nato are to be credible to the world , they must exhibit consistency in their policies ! - david bass , us the failure of the west to " read " russia 's real agenda - that saddens me !
when kosovo declared independence russia merely whimpered .
russia 's eyes were really focused on georgia .
with the eyes of the world focused on the beijing olympics , russia expertly stepped up its provocations until , unfortunately , georgia took the bait !
the rest is history .
russia is no longer keeping its real agenda secret . - irma da silva , philippines click on the links below to read the articles that were commented on . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .
there is an inconsistency here .
why is georgia 's territorial integrity important , but serbia 's not ?
why was kosovo granted independence but not south ossetia ?
if the un and nato are to be credible to the world , they must exhibit consistency in their policies ! - david bass , us the failure of the west to " read " russia 's real agenda - that saddens me !
when kosovo declared independence russia merely whimpered .
russia 's eyes were really focused on georgia .
with the eyes of the world focused on the beijing olympics , russia expertly stepped up its provocations until , unfortunately , georgia took the bait !
the rest is history .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity .

" no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said . " russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .
" that does n't line up . " the incongruities in russia 's policies will catch up with it in the end , added the german parliamentarian , and it ca n't rely on kosovo as a precedent . after all , russia has n't yet recognized kosovo 's independence . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view .

" russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .

" but now russia 's actions have created a shift toward voices critical of russia , " he added . russia has all the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has been left with few options when it comes to dealing with medvedev still , the problem remains that no one in europe seems have the leverage to take on an economically powerful , resource-rich russia , halbach said . " there is no real military option , and no real economic option towards a russia that is economically strong and does n't depend on aid , like in the 1990s , " he said .
" the only field that remains is the diplomatic field . " but even there , russia is standing in a position of strength .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned his country would consider severing ties with nato and does not fear the possible resurgence of the cold war . " russia is now in a state of diplomatic defiance and obstinacy , " halbach said , adding that every western move deemed aggressive by russia is then fed into this world view , creating a spiral of mistrust . many say that spiral started turning when the united states and many european union members recognized kosovo 's bid for independence in february . russia back on global stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's recognition of kosovo pushed russia to take a hard line with georgia after the west supported kosovo , there was extreme pressure in russia " to show the hard line " on georgia independence - even among leaders who , like medvedev , are n't really hardliners , according to stefan meister , a russia specialist at the german council of foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- . " medvedev is more interested in economic reform than he is in this conflict , " meister said .
" but it is putin and the hardliners who are making the decisions . " meanwhile , the georgia war is incredibly popular in russia because it showed the west - and itself - that it has bounced back from its post-cold war denigration of the 1990s . " they had to say : ' we are back and we are strong , " ' meister said .
" the process has its own dynamic .
medvedev had no choice but to recognize the breakaway republics . " with rhetoric high and diplomatic or political solutions nowhere to be seen , it is little wonder there is increased talk among observers of a renewed outbreak of cold war hostilities . plea to avoid ' bi-polar world ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german diplomacy could help stop further conflicts for his part , halbach said he hopes politicians will think hard before returning to a rigid east-west polemic . " i do n't hope the new raison d 'etre for europe would be a cold war ... anyone who talks about that should think for a while about what kind of military and ideological confrontation that was - between blocs - and whether we want to move in that direction , " he said . the gdap 's meister said policymakers should keep in mind that , despite difficult communication , neither the west nor russia is really interested in a " bi-polar world . " " we are dependent on each other , " he said .
" the russians see this ...
i have a feeling they are very angry about the situation .
everything is so politicized . " berlin 's special role halbach , too , argues that russia 's frequently stated goal of becoming a " responsible , reliable international actor for the 21st century " was threatened by the georgia situation - a turn of events russia will try hard to avoid . in the end , most experts agree the only way out is through diplomacy . germany , in particular , has the best chance of talking with the russians , because of historically open relations between the two countries , and because of its strength within the eu , meister said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president dmitry medvedev has warned his country would consider severing ties with nato and does not fear the possible resurgence of the cold war . " russia is now in a state of diplomatic defiance and obstinacy , " halbach said , adding that every western move deemed aggressive by russia is then fed into this world view , creating a spiral of mistrust . many say that spiral started turning when the united states and many european union members recognized kosovo 's bid for independence in february . russia back on global stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's recognition of kosovo pushed russia to take a hard line with georgia after the west supported kosovo , there was extreme pressure in russia " to show the hard line " on georgia independence - even among leaders who , like medvedev , are n't really hardliners , according to stefan meister , a russia specialist at the german council of foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- . " medvedev is more interested in economic reform than he is in this conflict , " meister said .
" but it is putin and the hardliners who are making the decisions . " meanwhile , the georgia war is incredibly popular in russia because it showed the west - and itself - that it has bounced back from its post-cold war denigration of the 1990s . " they had to say : ' we are back and we are strong , " ' meister said .
" the process has its own dynamic .
medvedev had no choice but to recognize the breakaway republics . " with rhetoric high and diplomatic or political solutions nowhere to be seen , it is little wonder there is increased talk among observers of a renewed outbreak of cold war hostilities . plea to avoid ' bi-polar world ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german diplomacy could help stop further conflicts for his part , halbach said he hopes politicians will think hard before returning to a rigid east-west polemic . " i do n't hope the new raison d 'etre for europe would be a cold war ... anyone who talks about that should think for a while about what kind of military and ideological confrontation that was - between blocs - and whether we want to move in that direction , " he said . the gdap 's meister said policymakers should keep in mind that , despite difficult communication , neither the west nor russia is really interested in a " bi-polar world . " " we are dependent on each other , " he said .
" the russians see this ...
i have a feeling they are very angry about the situation .
everything is so politicized . " berlin 's special role halbach , too , argues that russia 's frequently stated goal of becoming a " responsible , reliable international actor for the 21st century " was threatened by the georgia situation - a turn of events russia will try hard to avoid . in the end , most experts agree the only way out is through diplomacy . germany , in particular , has the best chance of talking with the russians , because of historically open relations between the two countries , and because of its strength within the eu , meister said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .

last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .

" ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said .

russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .

27 , to figure out their next best move in the high-stakes game of geopolitical chess being played out in the caucuses . while russia 's approach before , during and after the 10-day military conflict that concluded with moscow recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia 's independence has always been clear , the european response has been ambiguous . the war " highlighted certain fault lines that existed within the eu , " said uwe halbach , a caucasus expert at the german institute for security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . countries that more recently joined the 27-member bloc from central and eastern europe tended to be more anti-russian than france and germany , he said . " but now russia 's actions have created a shift toward voices critical of russia , " he added . russia has all the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has been left with few options when it comes to dealing with medvedev still , the problem remains that no one in europe seems have the leverage to take on an economically powerful , resource-rich russia , halbach said . " there is no real military option , and no real economic option towards a russia that is economically strong and does n't depend on aid , like in the 1990s , " he said .
" the only field that remains is the diplomatic field . " but even there , russia is standing in a position of strength .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned his country would consider severing ties with nato and does not fear the possible resurgence of the cold war . " russia is now in a state of diplomatic defiance and obstinacy , " halbach said , adding that every western move deemed aggressive by russia is then fed into this world view , creating a spiral of mistrust . many say that spiral started turning when the united states and many european union members recognized kosovo 's bid for independence in february . russia back on global stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's recognition of kosovo pushed russia to take a hard line with georgia after the west supported kosovo , there was extreme pressure in russia " to show the hard line " on georgia independence - even among leaders who , like medvedev , are n't really hardliners , according to stefan meister , a russia specialist at the german council of foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- . " medvedev is more interested in economic reform than he is in this conflict , " meister said .
" but it is putin and the hardliners who are making the decisions . " meanwhile , the georgia war is incredibly popular in russia because it showed the west - and itself - that it has bounced back from its post-cold war denigration of the 1990s . " they had to say : ' we are back and we are strong , " ' meister said .
" the process has its own dynamic .
medvedev had no choice but to recognize the breakaway republics . " with rhetoric high and diplomatic or political solutions nowhere to be seen , it is little wonder there is increased talk among observers of a renewed outbreak of cold war hostilities . plea to avoid ' bi-polar world ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german diplomacy could help stop further conflicts for his part , halbach said he hopes politicians will think hard before returning to a rigid east-west polemic . " i do n't hope the new raison d 'etre for europe would be a cold war ... anyone who talks about that should think for a while about what kind of military and ideological confrontation that was - between blocs - and whether we want to move in that direction , " he said . the gdap 's meister said policymakers should keep in mind that , despite difficult communication , neither the west nor russia is really interested in a " bi-polar world . " " we are dependent on each other , " he said .
" the russians see this ...
i have a feeling they are very angry about the situation .
everything is so politicized . " berlin 's special role halbach , too , argues that russia 's frequently stated goal of becoming a " responsible , reliable international actor for the 21st century " was threatened by the georgia situation - a turn of events russia will try hard to avoid . in the end , most experts agree the only way out is through diplomacy . germany , in particular , has the best chance of talking with the russians , because of historically open relations between the two countries , and because of its strength within the eu , meister said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .
there is an inconsistency here .
why is georgia 's territorial integrity important , but serbia 's not ?
why was kosovo granted independence but not south ossetia ?
if the un and nato are to be credible to the world , they must exhibit consistency in their policies ! - david bass , us the failure of the west to " read " russia 's real agenda - that saddens me !
when kosovo declared independence russia merely whimpered .
russia 's eyes were really focused on georgia .
with the eyes of the world focused on the beijing olympics , russia expertly stepped up its provocations until , unfortunately , georgia took the bait !
the rest is history .
russia is no longer keeping its real agenda secret . - irma da silva , philippines click on the links below to read the articles that were commented on . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president dmitry medvedev has warned his country would consider severing ties with nato and does not fear the possible resurgence of the cold war . " russia is now in a state of diplomatic defiance and obstinacy , " halbach said , adding that every western move deemed aggressive by russia is then fed into this world view , creating a spiral of mistrust . many say that spiral started turning when the united states and many european union members recognized kosovo 's bid for independence in february . russia back on global stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's recognition of kosovo pushed russia to take a hard line with georgia after the west supported kosovo , there was extreme pressure in russia " to show the hard line " on georgia independence - even among leaders who , like medvedev , are n't really hardliners , according to stefan meister , a russia specialist at the german council of foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- . " medvedev is more interested in economic reform than he is in this conflict , " meister said .
" but it is putin and the hardliners who are making the decisions . " meanwhile , the georgia war is incredibly popular in russia because it showed the west - and itself - that it has bounced back from its post-cold war denigration of the 1990s . " they had to say : ' we are back and we are strong , " ' meister said .
" the process has its own dynamic .
medvedev had no choice but to recognize the breakaway republics . " with rhetoric high and diplomatic or political solutions nowhere to be seen , it is little wonder there is increased talk among observers of a renewed outbreak of cold war hostilities . plea to avoid ' bi-polar world ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german diplomacy could help stop further conflicts for his part , halbach said he hopes politicians will think hard before returning to a rigid east-west polemic . " i do n't hope the new raison d 'etre for europe would be a cold war ... anyone who talks about that should think for a while about what kind of military and ideological confrontation that was - between blocs - and whether we want to move in that direction , " he said . the gdap 's meister said policymakers should keep in mind that , despite difficult communication , neither the west nor russia is really interested in a " bi-polar world . " " we are dependent on each other , " he said .
" the russians see this ...
i have a feeling they are very angry about the situation .
everything is so politicized . " berlin 's special role halbach , too , argues that russia 's frequently stated goal of becoming a " responsible , reliable international actor for the 21st century " was threatened by the georgia situation - a turn of events russia will try hard to avoid . in the end , most experts agree the only way out is through diplomacy . germany , in particular , has the best chance of talking with the russians , because of historically open relations between the two countries , and because of its strength within the eu , meister said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions .

the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .

" ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .

under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base .

" ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .
but that is as far as it goes . interview : christina bergmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .

no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .

the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .

as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .

" bad management must be sanctioned , " he said .
" a rescue is justified only when there is a threat to the entire financial system . "
on the subject of weaker euro zone economic activity , stark told the newspaper that the situation should be temporary .
weak euro zone situation " temporary " , says stark " for me , a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario , " stark said , as german economic indicators showed europe 's biggest economy was headed for rough times .
" after the german economy began the year with a bang , that was to be expected .
i nonetheless foresee more than a simple correction . "
german inflation hit 3.3 percent in july , the highest level in 15 years , but dipped slightly in august to 3.1 percent . " domestic demand in particular is developing less strongly than anticipated .
but this weakness will be temporary , " stark added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 27.08.2008 top cop : new laws needed to fight organized crime , child porn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia 's bloody business continues in germany but the pressure is on in its annual review on serious and organized crime in germany , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- announced that new laws were needed to combat child pornography and organized crime . the bka 's annual report on organized crime , issued on wednesday , aug .
27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .

" i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .
there is an inconsistency here .
why is georgia 's territorial integrity important , but serbia 's not ?
why was kosovo granted independence but not south ossetia ?

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union .

the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .

" ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .

obviously , a lot remains unclear .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said . " russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .
" that does n't line up . " the incongruities in russia 's policies will catch up with it in the end , added the german parliamentarian , and it ca n't rely on kosovo as a precedent . after all , russia has n't yet recognized kosovo 's independence . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity .

" by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .
but that is as far as it goes . interview : christina bergmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said .

" we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said . " russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .
" that does n't line up . " the incongruities in russia 's policies will catch up with it in the end , added the german parliamentarian , and it ca n't rely on kosovo as a precedent . after all , russia has n't yet recognized kosovo 's independence . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity .

" no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view .

but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said . " russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .
" that does n't line up . " the incongruities in russia 's policies will catch up with it in the end , added the german parliamentarian , and it ca n't rely on kosovo as a precedent . after all , russia has n't yet recognized kosovo 's independence . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .

it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .

russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .

they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .

the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 27.08.2008 experts : russia reveals double standard in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how sacrosanct is territorial integrity ?
despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said .

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .
but that is as far as it goes . interview : christina bergmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

they advised politicians to resist polarization by ignoring russian chest beating . western powers were struggling on wednesday , aug .
27 , to figure out their next best move in the high-stakes game of geopolitical chess being played out in the caucuses . while russia 's approach before , during and after the 10-day military conflict that concluded with moscow recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia 's independence has always been clear , the european response has been ambiguous . the war " highlighted certain fault lines that existed within the eu , " said uwe halbach , a caucasus expert at the german institute for security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . countries that more recently joined the 27-member bloc from central and eastern europe tended to be more anti-russian than france and germany , he said . " but now russia 's actions have created a shift toward voices critical of russia , " he added . russia has all the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has been left with few options when it comes to dealing with medvedev still , the problem remains that no one in europe seems have the leverage to take on an economically powerful , resource-rich russia , halbach said . " there is no real military option , and no real economic option towards a russia that is economically strong and does n't depend on aid , like in the 1990s , " he said .
" the only field that remains is the diplomatic field . " but even there , russia is standing in a position of strength .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned his country would consider severing ties with nato and does not fear the possible resurgence of the cold war . " russia is now in a state of diplomatic defiance and obstinacy , " halbach said , adding that every western move deemed aggressive by russia is then fed into this world view , creating a spiral of mistrust . many say that spiral started turning when the united states and many european union members recognized kosovo 's bid for independence in february . russia back on global stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west 's recognition of kosovo pushed russia to take a hard line with georgia after the west supported kosovo , there was extreme pressure in russia " to show the hard line " on georgia independence - even among leaders who , like medvedev , are n't really hardliners , according to stefan meister , a russia specialist at the german council of foreign relation -lrb- dgap -rrb- . " medvedev is more interested in economic reform than he is in this conflict , " meister said .
" but it is putin and the hardliners who are making the decisions . " meanwhile , the georgia war is incredibly popular in russia because it showed the west - and itself - that it has bounced back from its post-cold war denigration of the 1990s . " they had to say : ' we are back and we are strong , " ' meister said .
" the process has its own dynamic .
medvedev had no choice but to recognize the breakaway republics . " with rhetoric high and diplomatic or political solutions nowhere to be seen , it is little wonder there is increased talk among observers of a renewed outbreak of cold war hostilities . plea to avoid ' bi-polar world ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german diplomacy could help stop further conflicts for his part , halbach said he hopes politicians will think hard before returning to a rigid east-west polemic . " i do n't hope the new raison d 'etre for europe would be a cold war ... anyone who talks about that should think for a while about what kind of military and ideological confrontation that was - between blocs - and whether we want to move in that direction , " he said . the gdap 's meister said policymakers should keep in mind that , despite difficult communication , neither the west nor russia is really interested in a " bi-polar world . " " we are dependent on each other , " he said .
" the russians see this ...
i have a feeling they are very angry about the situation .
everything is so politicized . " berlin 's special role halbach , too , argues that russia 's frequently stated goal of becoming a " responsible , reliable international actor for the 21st century " was threatened by the georgia situation - a turn of events russia will try hard to avoid . in the end , most experts agree the only way out is through diplomacy . germany , in particular , has the best chance of talking with the russians , because of historically open relations between the two countries , and because of its strength within the eu , meister said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .

russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 27.08.2008 readers critical of west 's " double standards " in caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers emphasized the growing tension between russia and the west readers shared their views on the roles of the usa , europe and russia in the ongoing stalemate regarding georgia 's breakaway regions . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .
there is an inconsistency here .
why is georgia 's territorial integrity important , but serbia 's not ?
why was kosovo granted independence but not south ossetia ?
if the un and nato are to be credible to the world , they must exhibit consistency in their policies ! - david bass , us the failure of the west to " read " russia 's real agenda - that saddens me !
when kosovo declared independence russia merely whimpered .
russia 's eyes were really focused on georgia .
with the eyes of the world focused on the beijing olympics , russia expertly stepped up its provocations until , unfortunately , georgia took the bait !
the rest is history .
russia is no longer keeping its real agenda secret . - irma da silva , philippines click on the links below to read the articles that were commented on . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions .

the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .

" ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .

he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 27.08.2008 top cop : new laws needed to fight organized crime , child porn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mafia 's bloody business continues in germany but the pressure is on in its annual review on serious and organized crime in germany , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- announced that new laws were needed to combat child pornography and organized crime . the bka 's annual report on organized crime , issued on wednesday , aug .
27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity .

" no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view .

" no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said . " russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .
" that does n't line up . " the incongruities in russia 's policies will catch up with it in the end , added the german parliamentarian , and it ca n't rely on kosovo as a precedent . after all , russia has n't yet recognized kosovo 's independence . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .
the number of satellite positioning systems stolen in 2004 was only 10,637 .
last year , 54,232 devices were swiped . " navigation equipment is the product of the moment " , ziercke told reporters at the presentation of the report . ziercke admitted that white collar crime is another area enjoying a boom .
more and more people are indulging in tax fraud despite the publicity afforded the trend this year when a number of large businesses were caught and tax havens came under investigation by german prosecutors . organized crime suspects going before courts the fight against organized crime groups continued unabated in 2007 .
the bka brought 602 cases before the courts in 2007 , with 10,356 suspects investigated by the office .
the bka report stated that 42 percent of these were germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the duisburg murders led to increased mafia investigations since 1998 , ziercke said , 368 cases involving 4000 suspects from italian groups in germany have been through the german legal system . since the high-profile murders in duisburg last year , the rate of investigations into mafia dealings in germany has risen and as a result of on-going cases , as many of 65 top bosses could be arrested , he stated . on the topic of child pornography , ziercke said that new laws were needed to allow authorities to block access to web sites featuring child pornography in order to hobble a booming online trade . ziercke said the distribution of videos and photographs featuring juveniles in sexual situations rose 55 percent in germany between 2006 and 2007 , most of them on commercial web sites . new internet regulations needed in germany he said other european countries had managed to stem the flow of such images with so-called access blocking of offending sites , adding that voluntary schemes with the internet sector had been ineffective in germany . " i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .
so why do we have nothing in germany ? " currently authorities have to work with internet providers when illegal content is discovered on a web site .
ziercke said access blocking would allow police to take direct action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn offenders have increased in the last year last year german authorities reported 11,357 child pornography offences , up from 7,318 the previous year .
the number of cases on the internet more than doubled in the same period , to 6,206 cases . ziercke said the trade produced millions of euros in revenue every month with " younger and younger " victims . he said norway , for instance , had had enormous success with access blocking , netting some 15,000 attempts to find child pornography online each day . other countries with access blocking laws on the books include denmark , sweden , finland , italy , switzerland , britain , canada , new zealand , south korea and taiwan , according to ziercke . in the united states , access providers participate on a voluntary basis , while the netherlands , belgium , ireland , iceland , poland , australia and japan are considering legal crackdowns , he said . " i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead , " ziercke said . government says new regulations a case for the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says the eu would have to act to pass new laws a government spokesman said there were already legal mechanisms to take action against web sites " on a case by case basis , " adding that any question of new legislation would be better taken up by the european union rather than germany alone . the german internet industry association -lrb- eco -rrb- insisted the sector took the problem seriously and had been working for years with authorities to stamp out illicit images of minors and other banned content . eco president harald summa said it was more effective to continue the current practice , with an online complaint center collecting reports of offensive contact by internet users and handing them over to authorities . " we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 27.08.2008 readers critical of west 's " double standards " in caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers emphasized the growing tension between russia and the west readers shared their views on the roles of the usa , europe and russia in the ongoing stalemate regarding georgia 's breakaway regions . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .
there is an inconsistency here .
why is georgia 's territorial integrity important , but serbia 's not ?
why was kosovo granted independence but not south ossetia ?
if the un and nato are to be credible to the world , they must exhibit consistency in their policies ! - david bass , us the failure of the west to " read " russia 's real agenda - that saddens me !
when kosovo declared independence russia merely whimpered .
russia 's eyes were really focused on georgia .
with the eyes of the world focused on the beijing olympics , russia expertly stepped up its provocations until , unfortunately , georgia took the bait !
the rest is history .
russia is no longer keeping its real agenda secret . - irma da silva , philippines click on the links below to read the articles that were commented on . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the conflict in georgia was not insignificant to the us , who spent a lot of resources in the past five years on building up the georgian defense forces and infrastructure and by doing so raising the standard of living in that country .
with the backing of the us and nato , the georgian conflict has become a wedge into the cordial relationship especially with germany , which will have to pay dearly when russia could demand even higher gas prizes in the near future .
this provocation and the planned missile defense site in poland is a plain cold war gesture on part of the us . - g. gosau , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said russia 's position as an oil exporter gave it leverage over the west the russians have merely confirmed the status quo in georgia .
it seems to me the georgian government has been misled into an unsustainable position by cynical people who do not have the interests of georgia as their primary concern .
hopefully , the russians will withdraw from areas of georgia , but if they will not , then an over-committed us will not rescue them .
a western european dependence on russian energy is hardly a position of strength .
confrontation is not the answer because we are not in a position of strength .
since the fall of the ussr we have been arrogant .
let us try to secure what remains of georgia for the georgians and not make promises we can not keep . - larry adlard , uk the us and western europe should , by this time , understand what sets off aggressive behavior on the part of russia .
russia is , and has been after all , extremely sensitive about western countries getting close to its borders with military systems .
we for our part do not seem to be concerned about drawing a line in the sand and daring the russians to cross it .
i was in the us 7th army during the cold war and after the years of tension experienced by west and east alike , i do n't want the good works of our statesmen to be washed down the tubes by a bunch of hot-headed politicians .
we should remember we are trying to push the russians around within their sphere of influence .
just imagine what would happen if russia played the same game in cuba . - rudi rau , us i am amazed at the west 's ridiculous statements .
they seem totally blind to their own contradictions and double standards .
clearly the actions by the us and some european nations in the handling of kosovo have become a gateway to the current events in georgia .
russia had warned the west repeatedly that recognition of kosovo is a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and violation of international law and that such moves would only fuel tensions around the world .
we have already seen tensions growing in tibet , western china , india , spain , and this in georgia .
yet the west continues to act as if they were not responsible , and they continue to argue their hypocritical positions in each case .
i think this mentality will just push the rising power of china , india , and russia to center stage so much quicker .
the decline of western empire and power has officially started . - mike , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers accused the west of double standards after recognizing kosovo in the georgian province of south ossetia , ethnic russians demanded their independence .
georgia sent in troops , and russia responded by sending in troops to protect the russians from ethnic cleansing .
the un and nato are calling for russia to leave , citing a need to preserve georgia 's territorial integrity .

27 , said criminals were increasingly using legitimate businesses to cover up their illegal activities and that new laws were needed to combat the booming online child pornography market . joerg ziercke , the head of the bka , said organized crime gangs were increasingly infiltrating legal industries to launder profits from the illegal drug trade and using businesses as front for criminal enterprises .
the report showed that an estimated 481 million euros -lrb- $ 708 million -rrb- of ill-gotten gains were made behind the facade of legitimacy in germany in 2007 . while the drug industry in germany continues to be the most lucrative , the trade in stolen cars is on the wane . however , while the vehicles themselves are proving to be less popular with car thieves , the latest trend of having on-board navigation systems has given them a new , more easily concealed product : gps systems .

" i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement , " he said .
" experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union .

" we want to continue this effective cooperation , " he said in a statement , reported by the afp news agency . internet users who wanted to find child pornography would be able to get around " access blocking , " summa added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .
they 'll be keeping most things to themselves .
they 'll also develop voter mobilization strategies for the final weeks of the campaign at the very last minute .
we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .
in germany it 's obviously very important to reach the people who work hard and play by the rules .
but that is as far as it goes . interview : christina bergmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity .

" by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance .

the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .
what political options does the eu have in its dealings with russia ?
we should n't expect some miracle cure able to make russia change its foreign policy .
we have to think ahead .
that involves reminding russia that it is in its own interests to maintain economic cooperation with the eu .
it involves ensuring that the stabilization process in the post-soviet regions - politically , legally , and economically goes ahead , led and supported by the eu .
brussels should not allow itself to be thrown off track .
this process must go on , and the eu must insist it does .
what do you think eu-russian relations will look like in four months time ?
i would expect relations to remain difficult , because it will be necessary for both sides to take a few steps and review whether or not they still want a partnership in the first place . interview : jens olesen -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has clearly been an escalation in georgia .
the russians might even have attempted to provoke some kind of military overthrow of the government in tbilisi .
possibly , saakaschwili 's government felt obligated to intervene - it 's very complicated and it 's not easy to grasp what 's happening .
what is clear is that both sides wanted to avoid military deployments , but that 's not how the situation developed . and now we 're facing the risk that russia takes the opportunity to position troops in georgia on the grounds that it needs to protect the russian population in abkhazia and south ossetia .
what needs to happen now is that they return to their original position and stop jeopardizing the georgians ' room for maneuver in the georgian heartland .
other european countries - such as the ukraine and the baltic states - are afraid of moscow 's muscle .
are these fears justified ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states are worried they might get the same treatment as georgia the fear that russia will defend its interests aggressively and perhaps start to test the resilience of , for example , nato 's solidarity with the baltic states ort he ukraine 's western ties , is a justified one .
but the situation is unlikely to develop in the same way as it did in georgia , with an intervention of russian troops .
however , we should n't forget that the ukraine is home to one of russia important black sea fleet bases .
part of its population also has russian passports and pro-russian sympathies .
so a similar conflict is possible .
as for the baltic states : in these cases i would be more inclined to expect russia to gain influence with a cyber-war and infiltration , before it resorted to military intervention .
the eu urged russia not to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow ignored the warnings , and not for the first time .

despite warnings from the west , russia has recognized the independence of two georgian provinces .
but they have no legal grounds for secession and ca n't be compared to kosovo , german experts say . russian president dmitry medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia has come up against hefty international criticism .
georgia has rejected the decree as a violation of international law . german chancellor angela merkel called the recognition of independence " absolutely not acceptable , " adding : " in my opinion , this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity . " britain likewise criticized russia 's move , invoking " georgia 's national integrity . " no parallel in kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to the repression of the minority , kosovo had a right to secede , said experts however , the same politicians in washington , brussels , berlin and london which have staunchly defended georgia 's territorial integrity reacted quite differently in the case of kosovo , where they supported the province 's right to separate from serbia without the approval of the " mother country . " by advocating kosovo 's independence , the west defied complaints from the russian government , which saw the split as a violation of international law . international legal expert jochen von bernstorff from the max planck institute in heidelberg said the decision of western governments to recognize kosovo 's independence may not have aligned with the principle of territorial integrity , but they still should n't be accused of practicing a double standard . the situation in kosovo was different because the serbian government had violated the rights of the minority there .
as a result , nato intervened and kosovo was placed under international control . intense discrimination by the state over a long period of time is grounds for secession - the legal term used when a region acts on its own authority to separate from a state - , said von bernstorff .
but in georgia , there was no massive violation of minority rights and therefore no legal basis for secession , he added . chechnya policy does n't line up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz said that territorial integrity is important to russia , when it comes to chechnya ruprecht polenz , chairman of the foreign policy committee in the german parliament , took a similar view . " the policy of apartheid and the serbs ' use of violence against the albanian in kosovo have no parallel to the conflict between ossetians , abkhazians and georgians , " polenz , a member of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union , told dw-world.de. instead , russia is applying a double standard when it comes to the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , he said . " russia claims a right to secession in the regions , while in chechnya it has put a high priority on territorial integrity , which it has defended with extreme brutality against the chechnyans , " polenz said .
" that does n't line up . " the incongruities in russia 's policies will catch up with it in the end , added the german parliamentarian , and it ca n't rely on kosovo as a precedent . after all , russia has n't yet recognized kosovo 's independence . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but now russia 's actions have created a shift toward voices critical of russia , " he added . russia has all the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has been left with few options when it comes to dealing with medvedev still , the problem remains that no one in europe seems have the leverage to take on an economically powerful , resource-rich russia , halbach said .

deutsche welle : why did you come to denver ?
hubertus heil : we are here to observe the democratic national convention , not so much to watch the show - interesting as it is - as to talk to people in order to find out what an administration led by barack obama would mean in terms of foreign , security , economic and environmental policy .
obviously it would have an effect on german politics , and that is why we are here .
what conclusions have you reached so far ?
obviously , a lot remains unclear .
the candidate here to be nominated is very promising , to europe and germany , but his agenda is still unclear .
take the question of afghanistan or the environment .
these are issues we are discussing , and it is apparent that the democratic party , and especially the unions supporting the party , have a keen political interest in helping steer globalization - for example by addressing labor standards around the world . as you just mentioned , the convention is also a lot about show .
what has made most impression on you so far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd party conventions are much duller affairs it 's very impressive to see how much the city of denver identifies with the democratic convention .
it 's an extraordinary and very media-savvy show , as is standard practice in the us .
it could n't be done in germany , that 's obvious , but it 's very interesting to see how it works and to witness this political culture first-hand , and the us is in fact a very old democracy . have you met barack obama yet ?
no .
i saw him speak at the victory column in berlin - but i would n't call that ' meeting ' him .
do you think he would make a good social democratic chancellor ?
no , because we have a very different political system .
the us has a presidential system .
we have a parliamentary democracy , which means every country needs candidates that fit the system .
but do n't worry , we 'll find a candidate -lrb- for the chancellorship -rrb- . which lessons will you have learned from the democratic convention that could be applied to the next spd convention in germany ?
nothing that 's specifically relevant for the convention .
as i said , we have a different political culture , including party structure .
the spd is a people 's party , a member 's party , while the democrats in the us are organized differently , particularly during election campaigns .
we 're very interested in the online election campaign the party has been running , and the way it has managed to reach so many young people ; how it 's organized grassroots campaigns and recruited a lot of volunteers .
we can learn more from the technique than the agenda .
how much information can be gleaned from barack obama 's campaign team ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus heil you can learn a lot from talking to advisers , as well as to senators and congress members .
but obviously they are going to play their cards close to their chest .

we 'll see .
there 's a lot of talk here at the convention of rifts - barack obama on one side , hillary clinton on the other .
the party is hoping the convention will help it unify .
is there anything you can learn here that might help the sdp back home ?
as i said , every party needs to work within its own political culture .
but it will be interesting to see if barack obama can mange to win the blue-collar vote , the support of the working classes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 27.08.2008 eu concerned over russia 's possible plans for critical neighbors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western leaders do n't want to see russian tanks rolling into other countries as tensions between moscow and the west rise , new fears surface over the possibility of russian military action against other former soviet states and a face-off between nato and russian naval forces in the black sea . after moscow agreed to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia , georgia 's two rebel regions , as independent states amid widespread condemnation from the west , european leaders began discussing the possibility that russia could set its sights on other neighboring countries on wednesday , aug .
27 . according to french foreign minister bernard kouchner , russia was had breached security accords by recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he also warned that ukraine and moldova were both vulnerable to russian designs . " we can not accept these violations of all international law , of agreements on security and cooperation in europe , of united nations resolutions , and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country , " kouchner said in a radio interview .
" it -lrb- russia -rrb- is an international outlaw .
that is not just the opinion of the european union . " the leaders of the european union 's member states are due to hold an emergency meeting on monday to discuss their response to russia 's actions . " the european union , the 27 countries , 500 million people , europe 's economic power , must manifest themselves in this crisis to stop it and negotiate a political solution , " said kouchner , who would not speculate on what decisions the bloc may reach . germany sends observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been critical of russia since the crisis began in a move ahead of the combined eu meeting , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on wednesday to send up to 15 military observers to georgia as part of an expanded osce mission aimed at enforcing a fragile ceasefire in the region .
the german soldiers will wear uniforms but will not be armed , meaning their deployment does not require the approval of germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag . france 's kouchner was under no illusions that the osce observers would have an easy time and could be entering a region where escalation or expansion of hostilities were still real threats . " it 's all very dangerous .
there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia , in particular crimea , ukraine and moldova , " kouchner declared . europe identifies ukraine , moldova as possible targets the southern ukrainian region of crimea is mainly populated by ethnic russians and houses the russian black sea fleet at sevastopol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's influence is strong in some areas of moldova transdniestria , in eastern moldova , fought a brief independence war after the soviet union 's collapse but is not internationally recognized .
it hosts a contingent of russian troops . russian president dmitry medvedev warned moldova on monday not to make the same mistake as georgia by trying to seize back control of the breakaway pro-russian region . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn joined the chorus of concern by saying that the european union should clearly signal support for ukraine 's membership of the bloc to prevent it from becoming a russian target . " ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia , whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics , " rehn said in a speech to finnish ambassadors . the georgian conflict was a stark reminder that the eu 's biggest foreign policy challenge is relations with russia , he said . " but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government .
russia also can not stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors , so it purposely created tension in the region , " he said . like georgia , ukraine has a pro-western president who wants his country to join nato , a move away from moscow 's sphere of influence which has angered the kremlin .
it also has a large russian-speaking population , but is much bigger than georgia . kiev stands up to moscow and risks reprisals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is keen to seal its membership of nato and the eu ukrainian president viktor yushchenko called russia 's decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as " unacceptable " and threatened to raise the issue of a rent increase at the black sea fleet 's sevastopol base .
under a 1997 pact , russia leases the sevastopol base until 2017 for an annual fee of $ 98 million . saying any country which was not part of international security agreements could be next to feel russia 's military might , yushchenko said ukraine must increase its defenses and push its bid for membership of the nato military alliance . " we regret this decision , for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we can not support this position , " yushchenko told reuters in an interview .
" any nation could be next , any country .
when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity , we put into doubt the existence of any country . " yushchenko said ukraine had leased the base at sevastopol at below-market rates and it was time to think about raising the price .
he said kiev was also considering not renewing the lease when it runs out in 2017 . " we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict , " he said .
" we do n't intend to allow troops , which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country , to use our territory as a base . " these statements were issued as elements of russia 's black sea fleet shifted locations in a possible move to avoid a confrontation with a growing nato warship flotilla near georgia . russia wary of nato naval build-up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea fleet moves its firepower out of poti russian naval vessels operating off georgia 's coastline had moved from a station in the vicinity of the georgian port poti into " abkhazian territorial waters , " said sergei menialo , commander of russia 's novorossisk naval base , according to an interfax news agency report . the shift took a group of some six to eight russian warships that had been patrolling near the georgian port of poti out of the path of us warships reportedly planning to make a humanitarian aid delivery to the same location . american officials on tuesday said elements of the us 6th fleet would bring humanitarian aid to poti for delivery to georgian refugees from the russo-georgian war . the announcement put washington on track for a cold war-style naval confrontation with moscow , as elements of russia 's black sea fleet have been enforcing a partial blockade on poti since early august . the russian ships now off shore and tied up at abkhazia , a renegade georgian province adjacent to the georgia-owned port poti , was delivering humanitarian and other forms of aid via the abkhazian port sukhumi , menialo said . multinational humanitarian fleet nears georgian port bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a us coast guard cutter at the port of batumi , georgia nato , led by the united states , began a dramatic increase to its naval presence in the black sea in mid-august , after russian refusal to abide by a russo-georgian cease-fire plan engineered by french president nicolas sarkozy . the agreement among other conditions obliged all russian and georgian forces to return to pre-war positions - a stipulation the kremlin has in some cases ignored . a nato flotilla led by the american destroyer uss mcfaul already has exceeded ten warships and will reach eighteen vessels in coming days , kremlin officials citing russian intelligence said tuesday . german , polish , spanish , and canadian warships are among the members of the multi-national squadron being assembled in the black sea , according to georgian media reports . cold war rhetoric but no cold war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like old times : cold war exercises could resume russian admiral sergei kasatonov admitted the growing nato naval formation would soon be stronger than the russian black sea warships off georgia and abkhazia 's shore , but added that the kremlin could in case of a confrontation deal with the western vessels " using other forms of combat power , including aviation assets . " kasatonov 's comments made in moscow were among the first public statements by a top russian official of possible naval combat between russian and nato forces in the black sea . the motivation for the increasing nato naval presence in the region was " primarily political and not military , " he added . when asked about whether the build-up in the black sea meant that russia could choose to confront the west rather than cooperate with it , french foreign minister kouchner said , " that is not impossible .

but the best part in the film by miles will go to whoever plays hillary clinton .
how will anyone ever convey the shifting shades of light and dark we saw within her as victory slipped away in the closing weeks of the primary season ?
she demonstrated an extraordinary un-killability as a candidate ; ambitious and calculating certainly but durable , intelligent and informed too .
her tragedy in the end was that as a woman she represented one kind of history for the democrats , in the year when the party in the end chose another in barack obama .
her primetime speech at the democratic national convention will be perhaps the hardest scene of all to play .
her husband , former president bill clinton , was in tears as she acknowledged a standing ovation which stretched on for two or three minutes after their daughter chelsea stood on stage and introduced her as " my hero and my mother " .

there was nothing in it that the obama strategists could reasonably object to .
but there was , as always , rather a lot about hillary herself in there too - if you heard the speech out of context you 'd think it was delivered by someone who was still running for office .
if barack obama wins the 2008 election , this will be remembered as a gracious salute from a defeated rival ; if he loses and republican john mccain gets the white house , then we might just see it as the first speech of campaign 2012 .
if there was any doubt that hillary is still thinking about what political circumstances might best suit her own future prospects , then i think this speech probably removed it .
passion this was one of the hot tickets of the democrats week in denver .
it was almost impossible to move on the floor of the auditorium in front of the podium and every stairway and gangway between the packed seats was crowded with party workers , lobbyists , journalists and hangers-on , all sensing that something beyond the normal electricity of a big speech was in the air .

the phrase the obama camp was looking for was in there : " barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president . "
but no-one knows if that will be enough to change the minds of those hillary supporters who have been threatening to abstain in november or even vote for mr mccain .

they knew it for sure during the monica lewinsky scandal , when she rounded on her husband 's detractors .
and they sensed it again when she delivered a powerful argument for an obama presidency when she must still believe in her heart that she would make a better president .
plenty of her supporters mutter about not voting for mr obama , or even voting for mr mccain , because many of them believe that hillary was robbed of the nomination - either by sexism reporting , or the undoubted eccentricities of the democratic system .
she appeared to have those die-hard clintonistas in mind when she said : " we 're all on the same team and no-one can afford to sit on the sidelines . "
but such is the clinton reputation for manoeuvring and calculation that her critics will shrug and argue that she can afford to make that kind of remark knowing that her supporters will sense she means something quite different .
best part her praise for those die-hard supporters - the " sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits " - sounded to me like the words of an exhausted but proud commander who thinks she might one day need to call on her foot-soldiers again .
and that is what makes hillary clinton so endlessly fascinating .
there is nothing she could have said that would have persuaded either republicans , or democrats who do n't like her , that she was delivering a straightforward appeal on behalf of obama without a subtext that suited her own agenda .
it somehow sums her up that she now finds herself in a position where , however hard she works for mr obama and however many speeches she makes , people will automatically note that if he wins this election and holds the white house for eight years , her presidential ambitions will be finished .
if he loses , she will start the next campaign as favourite to win the democratic nomination , just as she did this time around .
it does n't mean she wants a republican win of course - she is a lifelong democratic party worker - it just means that once again everything that 's written about hillary clinton will be complex and ambiguous .

her primetime speech at the democratic national convention will be perhaps the hardest scene of all to play .

hillary clinton urges her supporters to get behind barack obama that plea was there , of course , and there were nine or 10 references to barack obama and even one to his wife , michelle .
there was nothing in it that the obama strategists could reasonably object to .
but there was , as always , rather a lot about hillary herself in there too - if you heard the speech out of context you 'd think it was delivered by someone who was still running for office .
if barack obama wins the 2008 election , this will be remembered as a gracious salute from a defeated rival ; if he loses and republican john mccain gets the white house , then we might just see it as the first speech of campaign 2012 .
if there was any doubt that hillary is still thinking about what political circumstances might best suit her own future prospects , then i think this speech probably removed it .
passion this was one of the hot tickets of the democrats week in denver .
it was almost impossible to move on the floor of the auditorium in front of the podium and every stairway and gangway between the packed seats was crowded with party workers , lobbyists , journalists and hangers-on , all sensing that something beyond the normal electricity of a big speech was in the air .
we are on the same team , and none of us can sit on the sidelines hillary clinton key excerpts : hillary clinton she did n't disappoint .
hillary the candidate was a sometimes cautious and often rather wooden performer .
in the two or three speeches i 've seen since she was forced to admit she 'd lost the race , she has spoken with passion and a real feel for language ... admittedly she has had sympathetic audiences , but she has brought them to their feet with style and assurance .
the phrase the obama camp was looking for was in there : " barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president . "
but no-one knows if that will be enough to change the minds of those hillary supporters who have been threatening to abstain in november or even vote for mr mccain .
that , of course , is what makes hillary such a riveting player in the theatre of american politics .
die-hard clintonistas so often at the crucial moments of her life she has known what has to be said in public and she has said it , even when people have assumed that she must have been feeling something very different inside .
some die-hard supporters believe mrs clinton was robbed of the nomination they sensed it when she appeared beside her husband to defuse those first allegations of philandering when he first ran for the presidency .
they knew it for sure during the monica lewinsky scandal , when she rounded on her husband 's detractors .
and they sensed it again when she delivered a powerful argument for an obama presidency when she must still believe in her heart that she would make a better president .
plenty of her supporters mutter about not voting for mr obama , or even voting for mr mccain , because many of them believe that hillary was robbed of the nomination - either by sexism reporting , or the undoubted eccentricities of the democratic system .
she appeared to have those die-hard clintonistas in mind when she said : " we 're all on the same team and no-one can afford to sit on the sidelines . "
but such is the clinton reputation for manoeuvring and calculation that her critics will shrug and argue that she can afford to make that kind of remark knowing that her supporters will sense she means something quite different .
best part her praise for those die-hard supporters - the " sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits " - sounded to me like the words of an exhausted but proud commander who thinks she might one day need to call on her foot-soldiers again .
and that is what makes hillary clinton so endlessly fascinating .
there is nothing she could have said that would have persuaded either republicans , or democrats who do n't like her , that she was delivering a straightforward appeal on behalf of obama without a subtext that suited her own agenda .
it somehow sums her up that she now finds herself in a position where , however hard she works for mr obama and however many speeches she makes , people will automatically note that if he wins this election and holds the white house for eight years , her presidential ambitions will be finished .
if he loses , she will start the next campaign as favourite to win the democratic nomination , just as she did this time around .
it does n't mean she wants a republican win of course - she is a lifelong democratic party worker - it just means that once again everything that 's written about hillary clinton will be complex and ambiguous .
very few people know what mrs clinton really thinks , and they never say .
as i said , when they cast the movie , whoever plays hillary clinton will have the best part by miles .

a disabled woman had to wait an hour and a quarter to get out of a train station as the lift was not working and staff appeared to have gone home .
kathryn nicholson , who is in a wheelchair and has spinal problems , could not get out of rhyl station in denbighshire after getting off a train .
the 51-year-old from rhyl spent 45 minutes pressing a help buzzer .
paramedics spent 30 minutes carrying her out , up nearly 50 steps .
arriva trains wales is investigating .
she said : " i felt every little bump as i was carried up the steps because of my back .
it was jarring and was very painful .
i was also very embarrassed . "
ms nicholson and her partner derek chipchase , 44 , had booked the train from manchester after visiting her father there .
she said , as she is disabled , staff in rhyl should have been notified of her arrival to help her get off the train .
i was freezing and i was getting more and more stressed and panicking because i needed to have morphine for my back kathryn nicholson but when she arrived on sunday at 1915 bst , there was nobody there to greet her and a female train conductor had to help her instead .
the couple then tried to get the lift out of the station - but found it was not working .
" there was nothing , it was as dead as a dodo , " said ms nicholson , who has fibromyalgia , which she said is similar to rheumatoid arthritis , and has recently had spinal surgery .
" i pressed the button next to it for help , but had no answer .
i kept pressing it for 45 minutes until a man answered it .
" he said he was in the main cardiff control room and that the lift was not working .
there was no sign or notice on the lift though and it looked like all the staff in the station had gone home .
" in the meantime i had called the police , who then put me through to the railway police -lsb- british transport police -rsb- .
paramedics were eventually called to rhyl railway station " my partner had also run up the steps and over to the other side of the platform to ask a train driver there if he could help and he rang the main rail control .
" by this point i was freezing and i was getting more and more stressed and panicking because i needed to have morphine for my back .
" finally there were sirens and an ambulance came .
i was put in a metal chair and two paramedics - a man and a woman - had to struggle to carry me up 45 to 50 steps , with my partner struggling to carry my wheelchair and luggage .
" it took them a good half an hour and it was n't easy because i weigh 12 stone . "
she is now demanding the station takes action to prevent other people going through the same ordeal .
" i 'm thinking about other people .
say you had someone in an electric chair - there 's no way someone could lift that , " she said .
" and what about people on their own ?
arriva trains wales head of stations , peter northcott said : " first of all we would like to apologise to the disabled customer and carer for the inconvenience and distress this caused them .
" we are already investigating this incident as a matter or urgency . "
the station was not manned at the time but a remote system was supposed to have been in operation where passengers can ring the bell to request someone to activate the lift .
this however also was not working on the day in question .

it perturbs me to come across surveys like the cbs poll in june - which showed that one out of five hillary clinton supporters will be voting for john mccain in november .

senator obama and senator clinton share virtually the same positions on a whole host of issues from healthcare reform to foreign policy .
i , too , was a staunch and enthusiastic hillary supporter during the primary season .

it does not make any sense .
this is really being made into a popularity contest rather than an election .
nyeatia richards , jacksonville , fl i agree with sumit .
though i am a lifetime democrat i have nothing in particular against mccain .
he seems to be a good man and i wish he would have gotten the nomination eight years ago .
but this country , if it wishes to retain it 's position in the world , needs to send a clear message that we are not bent on world domination and that our interests coincide with everyone else 's .
to do that we need to distance ourselves from the radical bush administration .
greg raines , austin , texas as a brit with a strong interest in american politics i could not agree more with sumit 's comments .
i think that clinton supporting democrats who are voting mccain should be ashamed of themselves .
they are putting personalities before policies .
everyone knows that there are not huge policy differences between clinton and obama yet the difference between obama and mccain could not be more stark .
another four years of republican governance will be disastrous for america and the world at large .

ms owers also raised concerns about children , saying their detention for " days or even weeks was damaging " .
the uk border agency -lrb- ukba -rrb- is drawing up an action plan based on the report .
inspectors said tinsley house provided a " largely safe and respectful environment " for the male majority of the population .
but they found there were " no care plans " for children detained beyond seven days , and some staff lacked child protection training .
the safety and security of female and male detainees at tinsley house is taken very seriously uk border agency statement inspectors also said there were " very few single women " , and that these women were forced to share facilities in a mainly male establishment which could be " embarrassing and intimidating " .
the report pointed to the issue as one which " urgently needed to be addressed " .
ms owers said another removal centre , brook house , was opening near the airport , and tinsley house should become " a dedicated facility for families and single women " .
the report released on wednesday follows a full announced inspection of the centre in february .
a ukba statement welcomed the part of the inspectors ' judgement which found that tinsley house remained a " safe and respectful " centre .
the ukba said : " the safety and security of female and male detainees at tinsley house is taken very seriously .
" females have separate living accommodation and access to facilities such as the laundry or refectory at ' female-only ' times . "
it added that the centre was " noted for its considerable improvement in arrangements for children " , including physical conditions , facilities and support from qualified care workers .

as she and her colleagues obeyed the calls of nature , the star spangled banner piped out of the loudspeakers .
despite being inconvenienced in the convenience , the americans immediately obeyed that other call , the one to honour the flag .
the ladies on the second floor of the pepsi center hummed to the sound of ladies singing along to the national anthem and holding their hand over their heart .
my friend does not know whether this show of patriotism extended into the privacy of the cubicles but she did point out that what she witnessed would never have happened in the uk .
i wonder if the republicans , who have set up their own war room here in the mile high city , were taking note .
they have , after all , questioned not just the patriotism of barack obama , but his american identity .
the first day of the convention was carefully choreographed to allay voters ' fears that despite his exotic name and complicated upbringing , mr obama was as american as the next citizen in this country of immigrants . "
if the symbolism ca n't be hammered home during convention week , when can it ? "
his wife , michelle obama , was almost in tears when she pleaded with the cameras that she loved america .
her family story , delivered with an inevitable hint of treacle , was the iconic journey from wholesome poverty to wholesome public service .
the gorgeous daughters were on stage to prove the point .
and just before you thought you had witnessed a rerun of the cosby show , the candidate himself popped up on a video link from kansas city , missouri , surrounded by a regular family of american voters , all white .
it looked a little ham-fisted but then this is a campaign and if the symbolism ca n't be hammered home during convention week , when can it ?
democratic royalty while michelle obama reintroduced her family as regular american folks , the gravelly baritone of a terminally-ill ted kennedy was there to illustrate how extraordinary the ordinary obamas are .
the kennedy clan is democratic royalty .
like germany 's hohenzollerns , austria 's habsburgs or britain 's windsors , they even display the predominant gene of royalty .
in the kennedys ' case these are square jaws , lego-sized teeth and a broad forehead .
and , like all royalty , they guard their legacy jealously .
on monday night , the last surviving member of the ill-fated quad of kennedy brothers passed the family torch to the obamas .
he did so right over the heads of the people who had originally expected to inherit the torch , the clintons .
what added insult to injury was that caroline kennedy , the former president 's daughter , was in charge of the committee to find a suitable vice-president and hillary was , it seems , not even on her short list .
sprinkled with kennedy stardust , buoyed by michelle obama 's slick performance and reassured by the rhetorical gift of the candidate himself , the democrats should be in a mile high club of euphoria .
after all , the winds of change should be blowing against the republicans and their president .
but , everywhere you look in denver , you find nail-biting delegates , nervous surrogates , defensive campaign staffers .
the rest of the world thinks that mr obama will be america 's 44th president but , at home , the democrats are the worried party .
to some extent , this is their traditional role .
like woody allen in one of his earlier movies , the democrats excel at fretting , agonising , navel gazing and over-analysing .
the opinion polls , which have mr obama and his republican rival john mccain neck-and-neck , prove that they have reason to worry .
the senator from illinois has had an arid summer .
he needs to have a bountiful harvest season .
the ghost of clinton but the other reason for anxiety is the lady who broods in the wings .
of late , hillary and bill clinton have not uttered a single public word of apostasy .
they are toeing the line , gritting their teeth and swallowing their pride .
they are also economical with their enthusiasm .
i am told that senior clinton people are n't even sticking around for obama 's big stadium speech on thursday .
this is damning with faint praise .
moreover , such was the clintons ' hold over the party that the faithful almost expect them to lash out and derail the meticulous choreography .
like the children of over-bearing parents , they expect wrath , even if there 's no evidence of it .
hillary clinton has become lady marchmain in brideshead revisited , a living reminder of the perils of abandoning orthodoxy - the orthodoxy of a clinton candidacy - and a permanent finger on the delicate bruise of guilt and self-doubt , that this may turn out to be a mistake .
the republicans are doing their best to press on the wound .
as the wall street journal asked : how could the democrats choose a running mate - joe biden - who garnered no more than 9,000 votes and ignore one who harvested 18 million during the primary season ?
the ghost of clinton needs to be exorcised from the convention and that is something that only hillary and bill can do .
the ritual of convention alone is not enough .

us party conventions are the scene of patriotism and ritual as she and her colleagues obeyed the calls of nature , the star spangled banner piped out of the loudspeakers .
despite being inconvenienced in the convenience , the americans immediately obeyed that other call , the one to honour the flag .
the ladies on the second floor of the pepsi center hummed to the sound of ladies singing along to the national anthem and holding their hand over their heart .
my friend does not know whether this show of patriotism extended into the privacy of the cubicles but she did point out that what she witnessed would never have happened in the uk .
i wonder if the republicans , who have set up their own war room here in the mile high city , were taking note .
they have , after all , questioned not just the patriotism of barack obama , but his american identity .
the first day of the convention was carefully choreographed to allay voters ' fears that despite his exotic name and complicated upbringing , mr obama was as american as the next citizen in this country of immigrants .
if the symbolism ca n't be hammered home during convention week , when can it ?
his wife , michelle obama , was almost in tears when she pleaded with the cameras that she loved america .
her family story , delivered with an inevitable hint of treacle , was the iconic journey from wholesome poverty to wholesome public service .
the gorgeous daughters were on stage to prove the point .
and just before you thought you had witnessed a rerun of the cosby show , the candidate himself popped up on a video link from kansas city , missouri , surrounded by a regular family of american voters , all white .
it looked a little ham-fisted but then this is a campaign and if the symbolism ca n't be hammered home during convention week , when can it ?
democratic royalty while michelle obama reintroduced her family as regular american folks , the gravelly baritone of a terminally-ill ted kennedy was there to illustrate how extraordinary the ordinary obamas are .
the kennedy clan is democratic royalty .
like germany 's hohenzollerns , austria 's habsburgs or britain 's windsors , they even display the predominant gene of royalty .
in the kennedys ' case these are square jaws , lego-sized teeth and a broad forehead .
and , like all royalty , they guard their legacy jealously .
the kennedy clan sprinkled political stardust on the obama family on monday night , the last surviving member of the ill-fated quad of kennedy brothers passed the family torch to the obamas .
he did so right over the heads of the people who had originally expected to inherit the torch , the clintons .
what added insult to injury was that caroline kennedy , the former president 's daughter , was in charge of the committee to find a suitable vice-president and hillary was , it seems , not even on her short list .
sprinkled with kennedy stardust , buoyed by michelle obama 's slick performance and reassured by the rhetorical gift of the candidate himself , the democrats should be in a mile high club of euphoria .
after all , the winds of change should be blowing against the republicans and their president .
but , everywhere you look in denver , you find nail-biting delegates , nervous surrogates , defensive campaign staffers .
the rest of the world thinks that mr obama will be america 's 44th president but , at home , the democrats are the worried party .
to some extent , this is their traditional role .
like woody allen in one of his earlier movies , the democrats excel at fretting , agonising , navel gazing and over-analysing .

it has revised its previous estimate and now says that 1.4 billion people live in poverty , based on a new poverty line of $ 1.25 per day .
this is substantially more than its earlier estimate of 985 million people living in poverty in 2004 .
the bank has also revised upwards the number it said were poor in 1981 , from 1.5 billion to 1.9 billion .
the new estimates suggest that poverty is both more persistent , and has fallen less sharply , than previously thought .
however , given the increase in world population , the poverty rate has still fallen from 50 % to 25 % over the past 25 years .
" this is pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank , " said elizabeth stuart , senior policy adviser at oxfam .
" the urgency to act has never been greater , especially in sub-saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty , a figure that has n't changed for over 25 years . "
regional differences the new figures confirm that africa has been the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty .
the number of poor people in africa doubled between 1981 and 2005 from 200 million to 380 million , and the depth of poverty is greater as well , with the average poor person living on just 70 cents per day .
the poverty rate is unchanged at 50 % since 1981 .
but in absolute numbers , it is south asia which has the most poor people , with 595 million , of which 455 million live in india .
the poverty rate , however , has fallen from 60 % to 40 % .
china has been most successful in reducing poverty , with the numbers falling by more than 600 million , from 835 million in 1981 to 207 million in 2005 .
the poverty rate in china has plummeted from 85 % to 15.9 % , with the biggest part of that drop coming in the past 15 years , when china opened up to western investment and its coastal regions boomed .

this is substantially more than its earlier estimate of 985 million people living in poverty in 2004 .
the bank has also revised upwards the number it said were poor in 1981 , from 1.5 billion to 1.9 billion .
the new estimates suggest that poverty is both more persistent , and has fallen less sharply , than previously thought .

deaths will outnumber births in the european union from 2015 onwards , the eu 's statistical office eurostat predicts in a new report .
by 2060 , the uk is likely to have the largest population in the eu - 77 million , ahead of france and germany .
despite migration , the eu 's population is set to fall from 2035 onwards .
an increase is expected in the next 27 years - from 495 million in january 2008 to 521 million in 2035 - but thereafter eurostat predicts a gradual decline to 506 million in 2060 .
