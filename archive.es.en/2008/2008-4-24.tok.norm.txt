program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .
hopes for an ecb bail-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief jean-claude trichet could hold the key an analyst at capital economics , jennifer mckeown , held out the prospect that the gloom might prompt the european central bank to lower interest rates .

" bisky also called for " glasnost for europe " and reiterated his desire for a referendum on the treaty , a stance taken by a total of 28 left-wing parties across europe .
he clarified that germany 's left party was not against europe but against the lisbon treaty and " the serious disadvantages " it held for the people of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party flew the flag of opposition over the treaty after thursday 's agreement in the bundestag , germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , will vote on may 23 .
passage by the required two-thirds majority is seen as certain there too . merkel hails a win for germany speaking ahead of the vote , chancellor angela merkel described the treaty , signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 , as " good for europe " and a " win for germany . " merkel was largely responsible for getting the heads of eu governments to agree on the text 's draft while germany held the rotating eu presidency last year . the treaty would provide a solid basis for europe to move forward , merkel said . through the lisbon treaty , which combines and clarifies earlier agreements to streamline eu decision-making , europe would grow stronger and more self-confident than before , merkel said . she also highlighted the introduction of more majority votes as a positive factor . social democrats , unions call for social policies kurt beck , the leader of the social democrats , said the lisbon treaty was a good basis for europe but should not be held up as the definitive plan for the future of the eu .
he also said the ultimate goal remained an inclusive constitution and a charter of fundamental rights signed by all eu nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck called for more social issues in eu politics beck , echoing the opinion of a number of large trade unions in germany , also called for the creation of a common social policy , saying social rights should be at the heart of european politics . the leader of the confederation of german trade unions , michael sommer , said thursday before the vote that the lisbon treaty should include a social progress clause , he added that " the treaty is not an end in itself , it should go on to help the working and living conditions of the people . " the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . no votes in referendums in france and the netherlands in mid-2005 ended attempts to ratify a more ambitious european constitution , leading to the drawing up of the treaty of lisbon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .

" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .

we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .

benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .
sales increased by 13 percent to 22.4 billion euros and company profits nearly doubled . dw world -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .

the bnd chief , however , will not step down . bnd head ernst uhrlau , who faced a second day of questioning thursday , april 24 , by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
however , the pkg has not demanded he step down . over the weekend , it emerged that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel newsmagazine reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 - a clear violation of germany 's basic law . pkg chairman thomas opperman , speaking after the committee session , said trust between the pkg and the bnd was at a low point . the commission also criticised the fact that the bnd 's top officials themselves had only learned of the case one year after the operation , a violation of an internal policy requiring official clearance . economy minister it only emerged thursday that it was not the reporter but the afghan official , identified thursday by der spiegel as economy minister mohammad amin farhang , who was the target of the operation . it was unclear why the bnd had set its sights on farhang , who has a german passport and lived for several years in germany . however , in not calling for uhrlau 's resignation , the pkg did not go far enough for the green party .
its deputy parliamentary party leader , christian stroebele , had earlier said someone should step down because of the incident and that uhrlau 's position was shaky . loss of faith in the intelligence service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau reportedly left wednesday 's meeting bright red in the face conservative interior affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl -lrb- csu -rrb- said the bnd 's cooperation with the bundestag 's oversight committee has been unsatisfactory . " the parliamentary control committee no longer has any trust on a cross-party basis in the management of the bnd , " he told german news agency ddp uhl added that a draft law would be drawn up in the coming months to rein in the bnd by bolstering parliament 's powers in the wake of the scandal to monitor the agency . further spying allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd was already caught up in a scandal involving journalists in 2006 meanwhile , there are also indications that the intelligence service might have been keeping tabs on other journalists in afghanistan . the berliner zeitung daily reported thursday that former zdf public television correspondent ulrich tilgner was informed in 2007 by a senior german diplomat in afghanistan that his telephone was being tapped . tilgner , who had been in contact with the kidnapped german engineer rudolf blechschmidt in afghanistan , questioned whether different standards were being applied to germans outside of germany . " for me it was clear at that moment that the laws that apply in germany were obviously being ignored by german civil servants abroad , " he told the paper . the bnd denied the allegation . two years ago , the bnd did acknowledge spying on journalists to expose their sources , creating a public outcry .
the agency agreed to stop these activities because they infringed upon press freedom . the bnd also installed spy software on the computer of the afghan minister , whose identity was not released , the afp news agency reported . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche and lower saxony have different ideas on how to move ahead with a law considered protectionist . supporters and opponents of a much-discussed porsche takeover of volkswagen exchanged heated words thursday in the northern port city of hamburg over proposed changes to how europe 's biggest carmaker is run . the discussion on amending vw by-laws was marked by fierce argument both in and out of a conference centre where around 2,600 shareholders gathered . a few dozen meters yards away , several hundred vw workers brought in by the ig metall trade union heard works committee head bernd osterloh denounce " the dreams of omnipotence " of porsche boss wendelin wiedeking and " the arrogance of an absolute monarch . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders ' meeting in hamburg a 54-year-old electrician at the main vw plant in wolfsburg said " porsche wants to split the group up and sell parts of it like audi , " the high-end auto brand owned by vw . " our fathers , our grandfathers worked for vw and contributed to its success , " he said . dirk , a 35-year-old mechanic who gave only his first name , said : " vw is only here because we , the workers are here , not the managers . " state role inside the center , the debate focused on the vw law setting out how the company has been organised and run since 1960 but which was ruled illegal in october by a european union court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of a vw-porsche 914 , a joint production of vw and porsche in the seventies the vw law effectively guarantees the state of lower saxony , where the company is based and which owns just over 20 percent of its shares , a veto over strategic decisions such as plant relocations .
a normal minority blocking share in german companies is 25 percent . porsche , which owns more than 31 percent and wants to take a majority stake , is seeking to amend the statutes so that it will have a freer hand with vw but this is opposed by lower saxony and ig metall . the federal german government meanwhile wants to come up with a new law that addresses faults identified by the eu court while maintaining lower saxony 's leverage in the automaker , which employs more than 300,000 people worldwide . german chancellor angela merkel was expected to discuss the situation with lower saxony regional premier christian wulff thursday if the general assembly did not last too long , government sources told afp . differing views throughout the day , speakers at the podium and shareholders in the halls or at buffet tables were quick to express their views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory wolfsburg , vw 's headquarters " porsche is right -lrb- to seek control -rrb- , " said one woman who with her husband has owned vw shares for more than 30 years .
" it would be better than if a foreign company took over vw , " she said . beate roehrs , 44 and a volkswagen shareholder for a dozen years , saw things differently . " porsche has always been a luxury brand and vw , like its name says , is a people 's car , " roehrs told afp .
" it would make me sick to my stomach if porsche bought vw . " reassuring words porsche legal expert konrad wartenberg told shareholders late in the day that " certain brands will not be sold , " mentioning audi and the spanish unit seat by name . " we do not foresee any job cuts at vw , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wendelin wiedeking , ceo of porsche , in a porsche 911 in addition , porsche had offered lower saxony " all kinds of solutions to ensure by contract the existence of vw sites in germany . "
but wartenberg held firm on scrapping the vw law , saying that the company " had a right to become a normal enterprise . " vw directors welcomed the growing participation of the smaller but powerful porsche in the much larger car maker 's capital although vw boss martin winterkorn acknowledged that " a few obstacles " remained . on wednesday , a meeting of the vw supervisory board had failed to come up with a compromise solution to present to shareholders , company sources said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they come amid a souring in sino-eu relations over tibet . eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , speaking from tokyo before heading to beijing for talks , said threats of boycotts on either side only " deepen differences , create massive resentment and make dialog much harder . "
earlier in april , the european parliament urged eu leaders to boycott the olympic opening ceremony on august 8 unless china starts talks with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , over the situation in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson is arguing for a softly , softly approach towards china but mandelson has warned against openly confronting china over tibet , saying the west must work with the emerging economic giant and not against it .

protests in china over the weekend , thousands of chinese demonstrated in several cities to urge a boycott of french goods in particular .

24 , for negotiations aimed at improving ties and building agreement over climate change policy .
mandelson is there to launch a new high level economic and trade mechanism intended to reduce friction over china 's big trade surplus . but the carefully planned visit has been overtaken by events .
now , just four months ahead of the summer games , barroso must attempt to please eu companies eager for business in china and those calling for at least a symbolic protest against china 's crackdown on protests in tibetan areas in march . the commission president is expected to raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expression , " during his talks , according to eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.04.2008 soaring euro , commodity prices hit german business confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german business confidence is heading further into the doldrums german business confidence took another blow thursday , april 24 , as the rise of the euro and soaring commodities prices contributed to a steeper-than-expected decline and fears of an economic slowdown . in the latest batch of bad news for european growth , already nervous because of the spreading global financial crisis , the munich-based economic research institute ifo 's monthly business climate index dropped to 102.4 points in april .
the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .
hopes for an ecb bail-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief jean-claude trichet could hold the key an analyst at capital economics , jennifer mckeown , held out the prospect that the gloom might prompt the european central bank to lower interest rates .
" the headline business climate index is still well above its long-run average of 96.5 , suggesting that the slowdown in economic activity should not be too sharp , " she said in an interview with the afp news agency .
" nonetheless , it might not be too long before further falls in business confidence turn the ecb 's attention from upside inflation risks to slowing growth .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .

the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .
sales increased by 13 percent to 22.4 billion euros and company profits nearly doubled . dw world -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?

the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

the bnd chief , however , will not step down . bnd head ernst uhrlau , who faced a second day of questioning thursday , april 24 , by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
however , the pkg has not demanded he step down . over the weekend , it emerged that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel newsmagazine reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 - a clear violation of germany 's basic law . pkg chairman thomas opperman , speaking after the committee session , said trust between the pkg and the bnd was at a low point . the commission also criticised the fact that the bnd 's top officials themselves had only learned of the case one year after the operation , a violation of an internal policy requiring official clearance . economy minister it only emerged thursday that it was not the reporter but the afghan official , identified thursday by der spiegel as economy minister mohammad amin farhang , who was the target of the operation . it was unclear why the bnd had set its sights on farhang , who has a german passport and lived for several years in germany . however , in not calling for uhrlau 's resignation , the pkg did not go far enough for the green party .
its deputy parliamentary party leader , christian stroebele , had earlier said someone should step down because of the incident and that uhrlau 's position was shaky . loss of faith in the intelligence service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau reportedly left wednesday 's meeting bright red in the face conservative interior affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl -lrb- csu -rrb- said the bnd 's cooperation with the bundestag 's oversight committee has been unsatisfactory .

" for me it was clear at that moment that the laws that apply in germany were obviously being ignored by german civil servants abroad , " he told the paper . the bnd denied the allegation . two years ago , the bnd did acknowledge spying on journalists to expose their sources , creating a public outcry .

" bisky also called for " glasnost for europe " and reiterated his desire for a referendum on the treaty , a stance taken by a total of 28 left-wing parties across europe .
he clarified that germany 's left party was not against europe but against the lisbon treaty and " the serious disadvantages " it held for the people of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party flew the flag of opposition over the treaty after thursday 's agreement in the bundestag , germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , will vote on may 23 .
passage by the required two-thirds majority is seen as certain there too . merkel hails a win for germany speaking ahead of the vote , chancellor angela merkel described the treaty , signed in the portuguese capital on dec .
13 , as " good for europe " and a " win for germany . " merkel was largely responsible for getting the heads of eu governments to agree on the text 's draft while germany held the rotating eu presidency last year . the treaty would provide a solid basis for europe to move forward , merkel said . through the lisbon treaty , which combines and clarifies earlier agreements to streamline eu decision-making , europe would grow stronger and more self-confident than before , merkel said . she also highlighted the introduction of more majority votes as a positive factor . social democrats , unions call for social policies kurt beck , the leader of the social democrats , said the lisbon treaty was a good basis for europe but should not be held up as the definitive plan for the future of the eu .
he also said the ultimate goal remained an inclusive constitution and a charter of fundamental rights signed by all eu nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck called for more social issues in eu politics beck , echoing the opinion of a number of large trade unions in germany , also called for the creation of a common social policy , saying social rights should be at the heart of european politics . the leader of the confederation of german trade unions , michael sommer , said thursday before the vote that the lisbon treaty should include a social progress clause , he added that " the treaty is not an end in itself , it should go on to help the working and living conditions of the people . " the 27 eu member states are being asked to ratify the treaty by the end of the year , ahead of elections to the european parliament in 2009 .
ireland is to hold a referendum on the treaty in june - the only country to do so . no votes in referendums in france and the netherlands in mid-2005 ended attempts to ratify a more ambitious european constitution , leading to the drawing up of the treaty of lisbon . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .
sales increased by 13 percent to 22.4 billion euros and company profits nearly doubled . dw world -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche and lower saxony have different ideas on how to move ahead with a law considered protectionist . supporters and opponents of a much-discussed porsche takeover of volkswagen exchanged heated words thursday in the northern port city of hamburg over proposed changes to how europe 's biggest carmaker is run . the discussion on amending vw by-laws was marked by fierce argument both in and out of a conference centre where around 2,600 shareholders gathered . a few dozen meters yards away , several hundred vw workers brought in by the ig metall trade union heard works committee head bernd osterloh denounce " the dreams of omnipotence " of porsche boss wendelin wiedeking and " the arrogance of an absolute monarch . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders ' meeting in hamburg a 54-year-old electrician at the main vw plant in wolfsburg said " porsche wants to split the group up and sell parts of it like audi , " the high-end auto brand owned by vw . " our fathers , our grandfathers worked for vw and contributed to its success , " he said . dirk , a 35-year-old mechanic who gave only his first name , said : " vw is only here because we , the workers are here , not the managers . " state role inside the center , the debate focused on the vw law setting out how the company has been organised and run since 1960 but which was ruled illegal in october by a european union court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of a vw-porsche 914 , a joint production of vw and porsche in the seventies the vw law effectively guarantees the state of lower saxony , where the company is based and which owns just over 20 percent of its shares , a veto over strategic decisions such as plant relocations .
a normal minority blocking share in german companies is 25 percent . porsche , which owns more than 31 percent and wants to take a majority stake , is seeking to amend the statutes so that it will have a freer hand with vw but this is opposed by lower saxony and ig metall . the federal german government meanwhile wants to come up with a new law that addresses faults identified by the eu court while maintaining lower saxony 's leverage in the automaker , which employs more than 300,000 people worldwide . german chancellor angela merkel was expected to discuss the situation with lower saxony regional premier christian wulff thursday if the general assembly did not last too long , government sources told afp . differing views throughout the day , speakers at the podium and shareholders in the halls or at buffet tables were quick to express their views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory wolfsburg , vw 's headquarters " porsche is right -lrb- to seek control -rrb- , " said one woman who with her husband has owned vw shares for more than 30 years .
" it would be better than if a foreign company took over vw , " she said . beate roehrs , 44 and a volkswagen shareholder for a dozen years , saw things differently . " porsche has always been a luxury brand and vw , like its name says , is a people 's car , " roehrs told afp .
" it would make me sick to my stomach if porsche bought vw . " reassuring words porsche legal expert konrad wartenberg told shareholders late in the day that " certain brands will not be sold , " mentioning audi and the spanish unit seat by name . " we do not foresee any job cuts at vw , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wendelin wiedeking , ceo of porsche , in a porsche 911 in addition , porsche had offered lower saxony " all kinds of solutions to ensure by contract the existence of vw sites in germany . "
but wartenberg held firm on scrapping the vw law , saying that the company " had a right to become a normal enterprise . " vw directors welcomed the growing participation of the smaller but powerful porsche in the much larger car maker 's capital although vw boss martin winterkorn acknowledged that " a few obstacles " remained . on wednesday , a meeting of the vw supervisory board had failed to come up with a compromise solution to present to shareholders , company sources said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .
sales increased by 13 percent to 22.4 billion euros and company profits nearly doubled . dw world -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they come amid a souring in sino-eu relations over tibet . eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , speaking from tokyo before heading to beijing for talks , said threats of boycotts on either side only " deepen differences , create massive resentment and make dialog much harder . "
earlier in april , the european parliament urged eu leaders to boycott the olympic opening ceremony on august 8 unless china starts talks with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , over the situation in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson is arguing for a softly , softly approach towards china but mandelson has warned against openly confronting china over tibet , saying the west must work with the emerging economic giant and not against it .
the trade commissioner also stressed that any boycotts would not help resolve the economic and trade issues between the eu and china .
protests in china over the weekend , thousands of chinese demonstrated in several cities to urge a boycott of french goods in particular .
carrefour , a french supermarket chain that has grown quickly in china , has been especially hard hit .
the olympic torch relay in paris was dogged by particularly serious disruptions , upsetting many chinese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has been a particular target of chinese ire european officials , led by european commission president jose manuel barroso , are in beijing from thursday , apr .
24 , for negotiations aimed at improving ties and building agreement over climate change policy .
mandelson is there to launch a new high level economic and trade mechanism intended to reduce friction over china 's big trade surplus . but the carefully planned visit has been overtaken by events .
now , just four months ahead of the summer games , barroso must attempt to please eu companies eager for business in china and those calling for at least a symbolic protest against china 's crackdown on protests in tibetan areas in march . the commission president is expected to raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expression , " during his talks , according to eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

porsche and lower saxony have different ideas on how to move ahead with a law considered protectionist . supporters and opponents of a much-discussed porsche takeover of volkswagen exchanged heated words thursday in the northern port city of hamburg over proposed changes to how europe 's biggest carmaker is run . the discussion on amending vw by-laws was marked by fierce argument both in and out of a conference centre where around 2,600 shareholders gathered . a few dozen meters yards away , several hundred vw workers brought in by the ig metall trade union heard works committee head bernd osterloh denounce " the dreams of omnipotence " of porsche boss wendelin wiedeking and " the arrogance of an absolute monarch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.04.2008 soaring euro , commodity prices hit german business confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german business confidence is heading further into the doldrums german business confidence took another blow thursday , april 24 , as the rise of the euro and soaring commodities prices contributed to a steeper-than-expected decline and fears of an economic slowdown . in the latest batch of bad news for european growth , already nervous because of the spreading global financial crisis , the munich-based economic research institute ifo 's monthly business climate index dropped to 102.4 points in april .
the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .
hopes for an ecb bail-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief jean-claude trichet could hold the key an analyst at capital economics , jennifer mckeown , held out the prospect that the gloom might prompt the european central bank to lower interest rates .
" the headline business climate index is still well above its long-run average of 96.5 , suggesting that the slowdown in economic activity should not be too sharp , " she said in an interview with the afp news agency .
" nonetheless , it might not be too long before further falls in business confidence turn the ecb 's attention from upside inflation risks to slowing growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.04.2008 soaring euro , commodity prices hit german business confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german business confidence is heading further into the doldrums german business confidence took another blow thursday , april 24 , as the rise of the euro and soaring commodities prices contributed to a steeper-than-expected decline and fears of an economic slowdown . in the latest batch of bad news for european growth , already nervous because of the spreading global financial crisis , the munich-based economic research institute ifo 's monthly business climate index dropped to 102.4 points in april .
the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .
hopes for an ecb bail-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief jean-claude trichet could hold the key an analyst at capital economics , jennifer mckeown , held out the prospect that the gloom might prompt the european central bank to lower interest rates .
" the headline business climate index is still well above its long-run average of 96.5 , suggesting that the slowdown in economic activity should not be too sharp , " she said in an interview with the afp news agency .
" nonetheless , it might not be too long before further falls in business confidence turn the ecb 's attention from upside inflation risks to slowing growth .

the bnd chief , however , will not step down . bnd head ernst uhrlau , who faced a second day of questioning thursday , april 24 , by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
however , the pkg has not demanded he step down . over the weekend , it emerged that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel newsmagazine reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 - a clear violation of germany 's basic law . pkg chairman thomas opperman , speaking after the committee session , said trust between the pkg and the bnd was at a low point . the commission also criticised the fact that the bnd 's top officials themselves had only learned of the case one year after the operation , a violation of an internal policy requiring official clearance . economy minister it only emerged thursday that it was not the reporter but the afghan official , identified thursday by der spiegel as economy minister mohammad amin farhang , who was the target of the operation . it was unclear why the bnd had set its sights on farhang , who has a german passport and lived for several years in germany . however , in not calling for uhrlau 's resignation , the pkg did not go far enough for the green party .
its deputy parliamentary party leader , christian stroebele , had earlier said someone should step down because of the incident and that uhrlau 's position was shaky . loss of faith in the intelligence service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau reportedly left wednesday 's meeting bright red in the face conservative interior affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl -lrb- csu -rrb- said the bnd 's cooperation with the bundestag 's oversight committee has been unsatisfactory . " the parliamentary control committee no longer has any trust on a cross-party basis in the management of the bnd , " he told german news agency ddp uhl added that a draft law would be drawn up in the coming months to rein in the bnd by bolstering parliament 's powers in the wake of the scandal to monitor the agency . further spying allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd was already caught up in a scandal involving journalists in 2006 meanwhile , there are also indications that the intelligence service might have been keeping tabs on other journalists in afghanistan . the berliner zeitung daily reported thursday that former zdf public television correspondent ulrich tilgner was informed in 2007 by a senior german diplomat in afghanistan that his telephone was being tapped . tilgner , who had been in contact with the kidnapped german engineer rudolf blechschmidt in afghanistan , questioned whether different standards were being applied to germans outside of germany . " for me it was clear at that moment that the laws that apply in germany were obviously being ignored by german civil servants abroad , " he told the paper . the bnd denied the allegation . two years ago , the bnd did acknowledge spying on journalists to expose their sources , creating a public outcry .
the agency agreed to stop these activities because they infringed upon press freedom . the bnd also installed spy software on the computer of the afghan minister , whose identity was not released , the afp news agency reported . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal .

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .

business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .

but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .

yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .

the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .

the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .

the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .

language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .

we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .

the bnd chief , however , will not step down . bnd head ernst uhrlau , who faced a second day of questioning thursday , april 24 , by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
however , the pkg has not demanded he step down . over the weekend , it emerged that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel newsmagazine reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 - a clear violation of germany 's basic law . pkg chairman thomas opperman , speaking after the committee session , said trust between the pkg and the bnd was at a low point . the commission also criticised the fact that the bnd 's top officials themselves had only learned of the case one year after the operation , a violation of an internal policy requiring official clearance . economy minister it only emerged thursday that it was not the reporter but the afghan official , identified thursday by der spiegel as economy minister mohammad amin farhang , who was the target of the operation . it was unclear why the bnd had set its sights on farhang , who has a german passport and lived for several years in germany . however , in not calling for uhrlau 's resignation , the pkg did not go far enough for the green party .
its deputy parliamentary party leader , christian stroebele , had earlier said someone should step down because of the incident and that uhrlau 's position was shaky . loss of faith in the intelligence service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau reportedly left wednesday 's meeting bright red in the face conservative interior affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl -lrb- csu -rrb- said the bnd 's cooperation with the bundestag 's oversight committee has been unsatisfactory . " the parliamentary control committee no longer has any trust on a cross-party basis in the management of the bnd , " he told german news agency ddp uhl added that a draft law would be drawn up in the coming months to rein in the bnd by bolstering parliament 's powers in the wake of the scandal to monitor the agency . further spying allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd was already caught up in a scandal involving journalists in 2006 meanwhile , there are also indications that the intelligence service might have been keeping tabs on other journalists in afghanistan . the berliner zeitung daily reported thursday that former zdf public television correspondent ulrich tilgner was informed in 2007 by a senior german diplomat in afghanistan that his telephone was being tapped . tilgner , who had been in contact with the kidnapped german engineer rudolf blechschmidt in afghanistan , questioned whether different standards were being applied to germans outside of germany . " for me it was clear at that moment that the laws that apply in germany were obviously being ignored by german civil servants abroad , " he told the paper . the bnd denied the allegation . two years ago , the bnd did acknowledge spying on journalists to expose their sources , creating a public outcry .
the agency agreed to stop these activities because they infringed upon press freedom . the bnd also installed spy software on the computer of the afghan minister , whose identity was not released , the afp news agency reported . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bnd chief , however , will not step down . bnd head ernst uhrlau , who faced a second day of questioning thursday , april 24 , by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
however , the pkg has not demanded he step down . over the weekend , it emerged that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel newsmagazine reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 - a clear violation of germany 's basic law . pkg chairman thomas opperman , speaking after the committee session , said trust between the pkg and the bnd was at a low point . the commission also criticised the fact that the bnd 's top officials themselves had only learned of the case one year after the operation , a violation of an internal policy requiring official clearance . economy minister it only emerged thursday that it was not the reporter but the afghan official , identified thursday by der spiegel as economy minister mohammad amin farhang , who was the target of the operation . it was unclear why the bnd had set its sights on farhang , who has a german passport and lived for several years in germany . however , in not calling for uhrlau 's resignation , the pkg did not go far enough for the green party .
its deputy parliamentary party leader , christian stroebele , had earlier said someone should step down because of the incident and that uhrlau 's position was shaky . loss of faith in the intelligence service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau reportedly left wednesday 's meeting bright red in the face conservative interior affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl -lrb- csu -rrb- said the bnd 's cooperation with the bundestag 's oversight committee has been unsatisfactory . " the parliamentary control committee no longer has any trust on a cross-party basis in the management of the bnd , " he told german news agency ddp uhl added that a draft law would be drawn up in the coming months to rein in the bnd by bolstering parliament 's powers in the wake of the scandal to monitor the agency . further spying allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd was already caught up in a scandal involving journalists in 2006 meanwhile , there are also indications that the intelligence service might have been keeping tabs on other journalists in afghanistan . the berliner zeitung daily reported thursday that former zdf public television correspondent ulrich tilgner was informed in 2007 by a senior german diplomat in afghanistan that his telephone was being tapped . tilgner , who had been in contact with the kidnapped german engineer rudolf blechschmidt in afghanistan , questioned whether different standards were being applied to germans outside of germany . " for me it was clear at that moment that the laws that apply in germany were obviously being ignored by german civil servants abroad , " he told the paper . the bnd denied the allegation . two years ago , the bnd did acknowledge spying on journalists to expose their sources , creating a public outcry .
the agency agreed to stop these activities because they infringed upon press freedom . the bnd also installed spy software on the computer of the afghan minister , whose identity was not released , the afp news agency reported . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but germany 's new best secretary has a y chromosome . as men are quite often told , women possess far superior organizational skills and are much better at multi-tasking than their male counterparts .
watch a guy trying to change channels while sipping beer at the same time and take the spillage down his shirt as justification enough .
it seems then that a woman would therefore make the ideal " coordinator of affairs " for a high-powered executive of either gender .
where else could those superior organizational and multi-tasking skills be utilized than in the role of personal assistant or secretary ?
no one would think a man would be up to the task , right ?
answering the phone while checking a schedule and signing for deliveries as invoices skip across the desk ?

wow ...
the 32-year-old , who said he often receives letters addressed to " mrs. schlichtmann , " was the only male finalist and won over the jury with an excellent all-round performance , said office supplies maker and event organiser leitz .
schlichtmann , who saw off some stiff competition , later revealed that he used to watch his mother with wonder as she worked as a secretary and that thanks to his strong organisational skills and flair for foreign languages schlichtmann had decided to follow in her footsteps .
for the past seven years schlichtmann , one of the two percent of secretaries and office managers in germany who are men , has worked as a personal assistant at international law firm allen & overy in the northern german city of hamburg .
rumors that he was intending to celebrate his win by getting his hair and nails done have been scotched as vicious stereotyping . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they come amid a souring in sino-eu relations over tibet . eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , speaking from tokyo before heading to beijing for talks , said threats of boycotts on either side only " deepen differences , create massive resentment and make dialog much harder . "
earlier in april , the european parliament urged eu leaders to boycott the olympic opening ceremony on august 8 unless china starts talks with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , over the situation in the province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson is arguing for a softly , softly approach towards china but mandelson has warned against openly confronting china over tibet , saying the west must work with the emerging economic giant and not against it .

protests in china over the weekend , thousands of chinese demonstrated in several cities to urge a boycott of french goods in particular .

mandelson is there to launch a new high level economic and trade mechanism intended to reduce friction over china 's big trade surplus . but the carefully planned visit has been overtaken by events .
now , just four months ahead of the summer games , barroso must attempt to please eu companies eager for business in china and those calling for at least a symbolic protest against china 's crackdown on protests in tibetan areas in march . the commission president is expected to raise " matters concerning human rights and freedom of expression , " during his talks , according to eu commission spokesman johannes laitenberger . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .
sales increased by 13 percent to 22.4 billion euros and company profits nearly doubled . dw world -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

competitors are also unhappy about the plan . the emergency loan program unveiled on tuesday is intended to keep the airline flying until a new buyer is found after air france-klm pulled out of a takeover deal .
but eu rules prohibit rome lending alitalia money unless it takes the same approach as a private investor in assessing the risk and setting the repayment interest rate . a spokesman for eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said the commission would contact italy in the next few days and seek clarification . " we have doubts about the nature of the measure and we want to understand if this is a commercial operation as the italian authorities claim , " he said . ryanair brands the plan unlawful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair is already spoiling for a fight italy is also likely to meet stiff opposition from rival european airlines .
irish budget carrier ryanair called the plan illegal and said it would make a formal complaint to the eu . " this latest bailout makes a mockery of eu state aid rules " said ryanair 's head of legal affairs jim callaghan .
" propping up an inefficient national airline , which would have gone bankrupt long ago is simply illegal . " british airways have also said they would be closely watching what happened in italy . in italy , plans to sell alitalia to air france-klm foundered because of political opposition and union resistance to the substantial job cuts the sale would have entailed .
incoming italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also pledged not to sell the carrier to a foreign competitor in the election campaign . alitalia loses around one million euros per day , but it is far from being the only airline in the red .
there is increasing the pressure for consolidation , particular in the us market , but also here in europe . growing trend towards mergers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has said he would defend alitalia from a foreign buyout this month , us airline delta announced plans to take over northwest airlines to form the world 's biggest carrier .
there is also speculation about a potential merger between united and continental . record air fuel prices - traded in dollars - are part of the problem .
european airlines are slightly more cushioned from this increase because of the strong euro .
the sub-prime crisis in the us and increased competition as a result of the open skies agreement , which liberalized the transatlantic flight market , are also affecting the sector . germany 's lufthansa is still flying high despite the industry 's problems .
last year , the number of passengers flying with the carrier rose just under 18 percent to 63 million .

the bnd chief , however , will not step down . bnd head ernst uhrlau , who faced a second day of questioning thursday , april 24 , by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
however , the pkg has not demanded he step down . over the weekend , it emerged that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel newsmagazine reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 - a clear violation of germany 's basic law . pkg chairman thomas opperman , speaking after the committee session , said trust between the pkg and the bnd was at a low point . the commission also criticised the fact that the bnd 's top officials themselves had only learned of the case one year after the operation , a violation of an internal policy requiring official clearance . economy minister it only emerged thursday that it was not the reporter but the afghan official , identified thursday by der spiegel as economy minister mohammad amin farhang , who was the target of the operation . it was unclear why the bnd had set its sights on farhang , who has a german passport and lived for several years in germany . however , in not calling for uhrlau 's resignation , the pkg did not go far enough for the green party .
its deputy parliamentary party leader , christian stroebele , had earlier said someone should step down because of the incident and that uhrlau 's position was shaky . loss of faith in the intelligence service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst uhrlau reportedly left wednesday 's meeting bright red in the face conservative interior affairs spokesman hans-peter uhl -lrb- csu -rrb- said the bnd 's cooperation with the bundestag 's oversight committee has been unsatisfactory . " the parliamentary control committee no longer has any trust on a cross-party basis in the management of the bnd , " he told german news agency ddp uhl added that a draft law would be drawn up in the coming months to rein in the bnd by bolstering parliament 's powers in the wake of the scandal to monitor the agency . further spying allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd was already caught up in a scandal involving journalists in 2006 meanwhile , there are also indications that the intelligence service might have been keeping tabs on other journalists in afghanistan . the berliner zeitung daily reported thursday that former zdf public television correspondent ulrich tilgner was informed in 2007 by a senior german diplomat in afghanistan that his telephone was being tapped . tilgner , who had been in contact with the kidnapped german engineer rudolf blechschmidt in afghanistan , questioned whether different standards were being applied to germans outside of germany . " for me it was clear at that moment that the laws that apply in germany were obviously being ignored by german civil servants abroad , " he told the paper . the bnd denied the allegation . two years ago , the bnd did acknowledge spying on journalists to expose their sources , creating a public outcry .
the agency agreed to stop these activities because they infringed upon press freedom . the bnd also installed spy software on the computer of the afghan minister , whose identity was not released , the afp news agency reported . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .
hopes for an ecb bail-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief jean-claude trichet could hold the key an analyst at capital economics , jennifer mckeown , held out the prospect that the gloom might prompt the european central bank to lower interest rates .
" the headline business climate index is still well above its long-run average of 96.5 , suggesting that the slowdown in economic activity should not be too sharp , " she said in an interview with the afp news agency .
" nonetheless , it might not be too long before further falls in business confidence turn the ecb 's attention from upside inflation risks to slowing growth .

the archdiocese of hamburg announced thursday that the cleric had been suspended for the duration of the police inquiry .
a city newspaper , the hamburger abendblatt , said a complaint against the priest was filed by krzysztof stobinski , a catholic layman on the archdiocese of hamburg 's pastoral council and president of the polish business club in the city .
the newspaper said the allegations had been discovered in correspondence dating back to 1999 and 2000 which had requested action over a homosexual priest who had been seen kissing and fondling an altar boy .
the newspaper said it had seen the details , but it did not print the priest 's name .
the priest worked in the hamburg archdiocese on loan from another diocese .
responding , archbishop werner thissen said he had not been aware of the allegations until the newspaper story appeared .
church moves to protect alleged victim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church feels it has an obligation to help the victims " i am very upset that a priest of our church is suspected of such a thing , " he said in a statement .
" i have suspended the priest involved from his duties until -lrb- there is -rrb- a finding over the allegations .
" this is being done to both protect potential victims and out of obligation to the suspect .
we will do all in our power to contribute to an investigation of these claims .
" if young people have been damaged by the actions of a priest , we deeply deplore it .
we 'll do all we can to help such young people . "
only last month , a german priest in bavaria , southern germany , was found guilty of sexually abusing an altar boy 22 times in the last five years .
it was later revealed that the priest had been sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting another child .
in a mass at st. patrick 's cathedral in new york last saturday , pope benedict xvi pledged his support for roman catholic clerics as they struggled to come to terms with a church sex scandal .
pope addresses us scandals on visit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope offered his support to priests in new york the scandal " has caused so much suffering " and damaged " the community of the faithful , " the pope said in his homily to hundreds of clerics and men and women of religious orders gathered in the st. patrick 's cathedral for the first-ever mass celebrated there by a pope .
benedict urged clergy members and religious communities " to cooperate with your bishops who continue to work effectively to resolve this issue . "
the pope assured them of his " spiritual closeness " as they strive to respond to the " continuing challenges " presented by the sex-abuse scandal , which the 81-year-old pontiff had made an overarching theme of his six-day us visit .
the us church has been shaken financially and morally by the scandal , which erupted in 2002 when the then-archbishop of boston confessed to having shielded a priest he knew had sexually abused young people .
according to information provided by the us church , there have been 14,000 victims of some 4,000 to 5,000 clerics since the 1960s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 24.04.2008 german culture 's boundaries are a battleground , says historian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does a nation need culture , and does culture need a nation ?
a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .

porsche and lower saxony have different ideas on how to move ahead with a law considered protectionist . supporters and opponents of a much-discussed porsche takeover of volkswagen exchanged heated words thursday in the northern port city of hamburg over proposed changes to how europe 's biggest carmaker is run . the discussion on amending vw by-laws was marked by fierce argument both in and out of a conference centre where around 2,600 shareholders gathered . a few dozen meters yards away , several hundred vw workers brought in by the ig metall trade union heard works committee head bernd osterloh denounce " the dreams of omnipotence " of porsche boss wendelin wiedeking and " the arrogance of an absolute monarch . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders ' meeting in hamburg a 54-year-old electrician at the main vw plant in wolfsburg said " porsche wants to split the group up and sell parts of it like audi , " the high-end auto brand owned by vw . " our fathers , our grandfathers worked for vw and contributed to its success , " he said . dirk , a 35-year-old mechanic who gave only his first name , said : " vw is only here because we , the workers are here , not the managers . " state role inside the center , the debate focused on the vw law setting out how the company has been organised and run since 1960 but which was ruled illegal in october by a european union court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of a vw-porsche 914 , a joint production of vw and porsche in the seventies the vw law effectively guarantees the state of lower saxony , where the company is based and which owns just over 20 percent of its shares , a veto over strategic decisions such as plant relocations .
a normal minority blocking share in german companies is 25 percent . porsche , which owns more than 31 percent and wants to take a majority stake , is seeking to amend the statutes so that it will have a freer hand with vw but this is opposed by lower saxony and ig metall . the federal german government meanwhile wants to come up with a new law that addresses faults identified by the eu court while maintaining lower saxony 's leverage in the automaker , which employs more than 300,000 people worldwide . german chancellor angela merkel was expected to discuss the situation with lower saxony regional premier christian wulff thursday if the general assembly did not last too long , government sources told afp . differing views throughout the day , speakers at the podium and shareholders in the halls or at buffet tables were quick to express their views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the factory wolfsburg , vw 's headquarters " porsche is right -lrb- to seek control -rrb- , " said one woman who with her husband has owned vw shares for more than 30 years .
" it would be better than if a foreign company took over vw , " she said . beate roehrs , 44 and a volkswagen shareholder for a dozen years , saw things differently . " porsche has always been a luxury brand and vw , like its name says , is a people 's car , " roehrs told afp .
" it would make me sick to my stomach if porsche bought vw . " reassuring words porsche legal expert konrad wartenberg told shareholders late in the day that " certain brands will not be sold , " mentioning audi and the spanish unit seat by name . " we do not foresee any job cuts at vw , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wendelin wiedeking , ceo of porsche , in a porsche 911 in addition , porsche had offered lower saxony " all kinds of solutions to ensure by contract the existence of vw sites in germany .

porsche and lower saxony have different ideas on how to move ahead with a law considered protectionist . supporters and opponents of a much-discussed porsche takeover of volkswagen exchanged heated words thursday in the northern port city of hamburg over proposed changes to how europe 's biggest carmaker is run . the discussion on amending vw by-laws was marked by fierce argument both in and out of a conference centre where around 2,600 shareholders gathered . a few dozen meters yards away , several hundred vw workers brought in by the ig metall trade union heard works committee head bernd osterloh denounce " the dreams of omnipotence " of porsche boss wendelin wiedeking and " the arrogance of an absolute monarch .

the index is considered the most reliable barometer of the current state of the german economy and its outlook .
the news this week that the value of the euro , a catalyst for the current slump , hit a new high of us $ 1.6018 on tuesday , prompted business leaders to call the european single currency 's surge " alarming . "
the value of the euro tailed off on the news from various european confidence indexes released on thursday .
referring to the decline in german confidence , ifo chief hans-werner sinn told reporters that the mood had gotten darker in the german manufacturing , wholesale and retail sectors in particular .
the business expectations sub-index , which measures the outlook for the next six months , declined to an indexed 96.8 points from 98.4 points in march while the business assessment index , which covers current conditions , dropped 108.4 points from 111.5 last month .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
business confidence slumping across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength against the dollar is hitting industry the news from ifo is the latest in a string of recent surveys which show business confidence weakening across europe , particularly in the manufacturing sector as it increasingly struggles to cope with a strong euro , record oil prices and easing global demand .
" with the set of lead indicators for the euro area almost complete , we believe that sentiment in the euro area has weakened markedly , " ubs european economist sunil kapadia told reporters .
" over the past few days , business confidence surveys have surprised on the low side in all the major euro area countries , " he added .
announced at the same time as the german slump , a survey in france showed that business confidence was also deteriorating more than expected .
confidence in the french industrial sector also soured more than expected in april , falling to the lowest point since december 2006 , a survey by france 's insee statistics office showed .
retreating confidence in germany and france came on the heels of a drop in belgian business confidence , which economists see as a bellwether for broader european sentiment despite the country 's diminutive size .
those indicators put the final strokes on an emerging picture of gloom after a survey on wednesday of euro-zone purchasing managers ' confidence levels for the manufacturing sector fell to a 32-month low .
" the message coming from the release of the business confidence indicators is unanimous across the main euro-area countries , " economist lavinia santovetti of lehman brothers said .
" at the start of the second quarter the outlook for the manufacturing sector has deteriorated substantially , " she added .
" in addition to the continued deterioration of the international environment , surging oil prices , the strong euro and slowing world demand probably explain these developments . "
crisis to deepen before any upturn is expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president sinn warned the slowdown was underway the situation in germany is likely to get worse before it gets better .
" after a brief brightening at the beginning of the year , the survey results indicate a slower pace of business activity , " ifo chief sinn said .
" the forces of a slowdown evident since mid-2007 have gained strength again . "
analysts from commerzbank issued a written report that warned that the economy could expect to take further hits .
" the economy can be expected to lose further momentum over the coming months , for a number of reasons , " they wrote .
" exports will no doubt be hit by the stronger euro and weaker economic performance throughout western europe , and domestic demand is being eroded by high energy and food prices . "
german government reduces expansion forecast germany 's economy minister michael glos unveiled the government 's economic growth forecast for next year , indicating the rate of expansion would decline to 1.2 percent in 2009 from 1.7 percent this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said that german growth would decline next year germany 's six leading economic institutes said in a report last week that they expected growth in 2009 of 1.4 percent .
the german economy had long seemed surprisingly resilient despite the slowdown in the united states , the international credit squeeze and a strong euro .
but recent indicators and data suggest such factors are beginning to take a toll .
the biggest european carmaker , volkswagen , said on thursday that its business was suffering because of the rise of the euro against the dollar .
meanwhile rising energy and food prices also remain a concern , with germany 's annual inflation rate hitting 3.1 percent in march , well above the european central bank 's target of below 2.0 percent .
data released last week showed a 4.2-percent jump in producer prices .
hopes for an ecb bail-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief jean-claude trichet could hold the key an analyst at capital economics , jennifer mckeown , held out the prospect that the gloom might prompt the european central bank to lower interest rates .
" the headline business climate index is still well above its long-run average of 96.5 , suggesting that the slowdown in economic activity should not be too sharp , " she said in an interview with the afp news agency .
" nonetheless , it might not be too long before further falls in business confidence turn the ecb 's attention from upside inflation risks to slowing growth .

a three-day goethe institute symposium on the " kulturnation " has kicked off in berlin .
dw talked to historian konrad jarausch about why germans get so worked up about the idea of culture . jarausch is one of a number of academics , authors , journalists , politicians and cultural vips invited to the kulturnation -lrb- literally : culture nation -rrb- meeting to debate questions like : is there such a thing as german music , or does television program germans ' national identity ?
born in 1941 in magdeburg , jarausch received his higher education in the us , where he was a professor of german history at various american universities .
until recently he was also the director of the center for contemporary historical research at the university of potsdam .
he spoke to dw-world.de about a symposium that is trying to redefine an old-fashioned , nationalistic idea to accommodate today 's germany .
dw-world.de : the word kulturnation is basically untranslatable .
how would you explain it to non-german speakers ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the symposium program features a statue of schiller guarding a fire extinguisher konrad jarausch : it connotes a nation defined by cultural commonality rather than a political system .
culture is , of course , a complex term , ranging all the way from literature , art and - especially in the german case - music , down to habits such as what one does at christmas , what carols do you sing and things like that .
the concept originated in the 18th and 19th centuries amidst german political fragmentation , and it implied that the prussian-dominated german nation created in 1870 was the necessary culmination of a cultural development .
yes , as you indicated , its roots really are in the late 18th century in a cultural revival that had to do with the elites and the nobility looking toward france , starting a king of counter-movement emphasizing the commonality of the german language , and creating a high literature in contrast to french culture .
the early phase of this cultural revival was cosmopolitan and open .
the problem came 100 years later when there was a national state , and the concept was used to reach out to people who were german speaking or had german ancestry or customs in eastern europe , latin america and the midwest of the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is one of germany 's hottest film directors in the anglo-american world , culture is n't seen as being so closely connected with the nation-state , and the idea was misused during the third reich .
is it time for germans to give up their obsession with and fetishization of culture ?
language use is n't congruent with political borders .
to an english-speaking person this is n't an issue because of england , with all of its former colonies , and because english speakers are used to their language being a kind of lingua franca .
but if you go back to europe , the french made a concerted effort to make everyone in the so-called hexagon , continental france , speak french - including people like alsatians who wanted to be french politically , but not culturally .
so this is more of a continental european problem , in which the assumption was that language and cultural borders would coincide with political frontiers .
this notion created nothing but trouble in the 20th century and was involved in both world wars .
there are german speakers today in austria , switzerland , a tiny part of belgium and some would say luxembourg .
and i think if one understands the difference , the concept does n't have to have its nasty political overtone .
during the german division between 1949 and 1989 , progressive writers like guenter grass used it to emphasize what east and west germany still had in common .
in that case it served as a kind of a cultural bracket , which made unification possible again in 1990 .
what it requires is a sophisticated non-nationalist treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have always taken great pride in high-cultural excellence a few years ago , there was much talk about germany needing a " lead culture " or leitkultur to which immigrants would also have to belong .
what 's the difference with the notion of a kulturstaat ?
with leitkultur , there 's the assumption that there can also be other cultures .
the question is : what do all people have to have in common who live in the shrunken version of the german nation-state that got re-founded in 1990 .
the assumption on the left was always that it was enough to have an understanding of the constitution .
the problem with that is that if you 're living in a kind of a different world , let 's say a turkish-speaking neighborhood in berlin , where you 're watching turkish tv and reading turkish newspapers , you 're sort of extraterritorial .
these people lose out .
they do n't get jobs and form a new underclass .
so it 's about social stratification and missed chances .
the question there is : what has to be included in the leitkultur ?
do they have to sing " silent night " in front of a christmas tree ?
or is it enough if they understand the constitution , treat women like human beings and function sufficiently well in the german language to be integrated into the economic world ?
it 's difficult to draw boundaries .
the conservatives want to extend the concept of leitkultur in order to germanize people they consider foreigners .
i think the left has begun to understand that there 's a cultural dimension of citizenship that has to be added to the question of whether you understand the fundamental rights of the constitution .
the battleground , i think , is how far this cultural dimension extends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad jarausch is the author of a number of respected books on german history can the goethe institute symposium achieve any concrete results ?
or is it just discussion among cultural vips ?
-lrb- he laughs -rrb- that 's part of it , but i think a discussion among cultural vips has the chance to change what is a common cultural understanding .
the goethe institute represents german culture aboard , but what that could mean has become ever harder to define .
the tourist definition of yodeling , lederhosen and beer is only a regional reflection of bavarianism and does n't have a whole lot to do with what germany is really about .
in the past , the goethe institute has had an intelligent strategy of representing germany 's diversity , which is not a homogeneous , easily graspable national culture , but rather a spectrum that ranges all the way from folklore to recent , somewhat abrasive turkish-german movies by directors like fatih akin .
they 've also tried to represent critical voices in germany , not just the sort of self-congratulatory stuff one finds in sales brochures about german hi-tech and the german social-welfare state being better than anywhere else .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to germany than the oktoberfest you have deep connections with both the us and germany .
what does american culture vis-a-vis german culture mean to you personally ?
when i left germany , i felt tremendously liberated in the united states .
the fact that not every house had a fence around it , that one lawn flowed into the next , suggested that this was a considerably freer society .
this was the understandable misperception of a young foreign student , and i started out in wyoming with the wide open spaces of the american west , which almost blew my mind .
i wanted to get away from german guilt because of the two world wars and the holocaust , and i wanted to get away from the heavy weight of a couple thousand years of european culture .
i felt almost smothered , and easy-going american manners and easily accessible american culture seemed very liberating to me as a young person .
in the meantime , i 've come around almost full circle .
i 've grown to appreciate the existence of american high culture and sophistication , and i think it 's very important that many of the best ideas in the world are developed in the context of this culture .
but i 'm really distressed by some of the things that have happened under the last couple of us administrations and the cultural alienation between the us and europe .
after reagan , a good part of the us seemed to want to jump back into a mythical 19th century that never existed - images which seem to have a lot to do with cowboy movies .
i do n't think that 's really helpful in the early 21st century - i 'm thinking about things like the environment , the death penalty or attitudes toward war .
in all those matters , i 've become re-europeanized , and i hope that americans will not depart from these values altogether .
i hope that in another generation there 'll be a bit more cultural convergence between the americans and the europeans .

in a report in the journal nature , us researchers say they have worked out how black holes emit jet streams of particles at close to light speed .
the boston university team say the streams originate in the magnetic field near the edge of the black hole .

" we have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet , where the particles actually are accelerated , " prof marscher said in a statement .
university of michigan astronomy professor hugh aller , who worked on the project , told reuters news agency that the process of accelerating the material to nearly the speed of light was similar to what happened in a jet engine .

let me tell you about myself .
i 've been teaching for eight years .
in order to become a teacher i got a degree in history from swansea university and then a pgce -lsb- postgraduate certificate in education -rsb- from newport .
when i started teaching i also returned to university in the evenings for five years in order to get an ma in education management .
i ca n't believe that after all this study and hard work i now have to strike over my pay .
i 'm surrounded by friends who graduated at the same time as me , who now work in the private sector earning twice as much if not three times as much as i do .
whilst they put in the standard 37-hour week , i 'm working on average 60 hours .
i 'm not being greedy .
i 'm not asking for a double in my salary - just a fair and decent wage .
i have a mortgage of £ 63,000 -lrb- which is relatively low compared to most -rrb- and yet this month my mortgage payments stand to increase by £ 70 a month .
is it right that i 'm worth less this year than i was last year ?
helen robbins but i am lucky !
the average newly qualified teacher 's pay will not qualify them to secure a mortgage in 75 % of the towns in england and wales .
at least i am on the property ladder .
my only problem is staying on it .
what of those who ca n't afford to reach the first rung ?
combine this with an increase in utility bills , council tax , petrol , food , childcare -lrb- a new born baby -rrb- and general living costs and i can honestly say despite being on the upper pay scale we only just make ends meet .
is it right that i 'm worth less this year than i was last year ?
and despite knowing that this is how the government see me i 'm supposed to inspire and challenge my pupils ?
is it any wonder that morale is low in the teaching profession particularly amongst young teachers who effectively are losing more than £ 2 a day , every day , and will continue to do so until their pay awards match inflation ?
i 'm presently supplementing my income by working as a musical director for a choir in the evenings so that we can have the nice things like holidays , days out and treats .
inflation a lot of my friends who have children have asked me why there is the need to strike .
why are we causing disruption for children ?
i reply with the fact that i 'm striking because i care about my pupils and because i believe they deserve the best .
and unfortunately hundreds of great young teachers are leaving the profession each year because of the pay and furthermore many excellent graduates are choosing not to enter the profession because of its pay .
over half the teachers who train have left the profession within five years .
it 's the first time the nut has gone on strike in 21 years , because my union believes it 's time something was done .
inflation has cut the starting pay for graduates entering the teaching profession by £ 1,000 a year .
other graduates starting pay now averages £ 3,000 more .
for a teacher such as myself on the upper pay scale , my loss in salary since 2005 is £ 1.600 .
add in the current inflation rate and by this time next year i will have lost £ 4,000 .
i do n't know about you , but there are lots of things that i could do with four grand !
it 's time this government woke up to itself and realised that teachers are not making unreasonable demands but just asking for the fair pay rise they deserve .
i know that i will never earn the kind of six-figure salaries enjoyed by those in the city .
but that is because i chose this profession which i enjoy and take enormous pleasure from .
my union understands that all we want is fair pay for teachers - fair treatment for us all .

let me tell you about myself .
i 've been teaching for eight years .
in order to become a teacher i got a degree in history from swansea university and then a pgce -lsb- postgraduate certificate in education -rsb- from newport .
when i started teaching i also returned to university in the evenings for five years in order to get an ma in education management .
i ca n't believe that after all this study and hard work i now have to strike over my pay .
i 'm surrounded by friends who graduated at the same time as me , who now work in the private sector earning twice as much if not three times as much as i do .
whilst they put in the standard 37-hour week , i 'm working on average 60 hours .
i 'm not being greedy .
i 'm not asking for a double in my salary - just a fair and decent wage .
i have a mortgage of £ 63,000 -lrb- which is relatively low compared to most -rrb- and yet this month my mortgage payments stand to increase by £ 70 a month .
is it right that i 'm worth less this year than i was last year ?
helen robbins but i am lucky !
the average newly qualified teacher 's pay will not qualify them to secure a mortgage in 75 % of the towns in england and wales .
at least i am on the property ladder .
my only problem is staying on it .
what of those who ca n't afford to reach the first rung ?
combine this with an increase in utility bills , council tax , petrol , food , childcare -lrb- a new born baby -rrb- and general living costs and i can honestly say despite being on the upper pay scale we only just make ends meet .
is it right that i 'm worth less this year than i was last year ?
and despite knowing that this is how the government see me i 'm supposed to inspire and challenge my pupils ?
is it any wonder that morale is low in the teaching profession particularly amongst young teachers who effectively are losing more than £ 2 a day , every day , and will continue to do so until their pay awards match inflation ?
i 'm presently supplementing my income by working as a musical director for a choir in the evenings so that we can have the nice things like holidays , days out and treats .
inflation a lot of my friends who have children have asked me why there is the need to strike .
why are we causing disruption for children ?
i reply with the fact that i 'm striking because i care about my pupils and because i believe they deserve the best .
and unfortunately hundreds of great young teachers are leaving the profession each year because of the pay and furthermore many excellent graduates are choosing not to enter the profession because of its pay .
over half the teachers who train have left the profession within five years .
it 's the first time the nut has gone on strike in 21 years , because my union believes it 's time something was done .
inflation has cut the starting pay for graduates entering the teaching profession by £ 1,000 a year .
other graduates starting pay now averages £ 3,000 more .
for a teacher such as myself on the upper pay scale , my loss in salary since 2005 is £ 1.600 .
add in the current inflation rate and by this time next year i will have lost £ 4,000 .
i do n't know about you , but there are lots of things that i could do with four grand !
it 's time this government woke up to itself and realised that teachers are not making unreasonable demands but just asking for the fair pay rise they deserve .
i know that i will never earn the kind of six-figure salaries enjoyed by those in the city .
but that is because i chose this profession which i enjoy and take enormous pleasure from .
my union understands that all we want is fair pay for teachers - fair treatment for us all .

security breaches there have been a series of high-profile data losses .
banking giant hsbc lost a disc from its southampton office , containing details of 370,000 customers .
in the past year , both the nationwide building society and the norwich union insurance company have suffered heavy fines and public reprimands for not looking after customer details properly .

company spokesman richard longden said : " if the general public buy fuel normally , there wo n't be a problem . "
he added : " there will be disruption but we are doing everything in our powers to minimise any disruption there will be to the motorist . "
the strike over proposed pension changes is due to start on sunday .
mr longden went on : " we are working with the government and with bp to put contingency plans in place to make sure that there is sufficient fuel .
" this plant has never been closed like this before .
the unions are forcing us to take the plant right down so that it is actually what they call cold .
" that means that we will have to stop all production at the site .
clearly we are a major supplier of fuel to scotland and so there will be disruption but we are doing everything in our powers to minimise any disruption there will be to the motorist .
" we have absolutely bent over backwards .
we 've shown flexibility and made concessions on every major concern raised about the proposed changes . "

how on earth did this happen ?
cometh the hour , sometimes cometh the man .
" sir " brian little certainly was the man .
interesting that almost 20 years later he finds himself in the same position at wrexham .
there had been many to blame to darlo 's fall from grace but brian had been drafted in far too late in that season to work any instant miracles .

wrexham 's demise - a fan 's eye view however , it soon became clear that he was the messiah .
his close-season rebuilding of the squad and his attention to detail swept darlo to two successive championships .
first , the conference title ; then the following season , the old fourth division .
so , what was it like from a fan 's perspective , once the shattered dreams and glass of the road accident had been swept up ?
in absolute truth , if you nowadays asked any darlo fan who was there at the time , they would tell you that the conference season was " the season of all seasons . "
for a start , the club , despite severe financial pressures , decided to retain a fully professional squad .
over the close season , fans could see this rebuilding , with darlo even paying out a few decent transfer fees for the first time in several years .
the hardcore fans hit upon an inspirational concept of " the only way is up " - which was the strapline for the " darlo on tour " t-shirts .
these optimistic themes paved the way to a fantastic season , which really was a tour .
there were so many new , virgin territory teams and grounds for darlo 's away fans to visit and , by logic , so many new teams for home fans to see .
home gates steadily increased as did darlo 's away support , the latter continuing to the present day .
crowds rose during darlington 's conference season in 1989-1990 people will perhaps ask what were the actual pleasures in visiting so many new grounds if the real objective was the very scary , nail-biting need to regain a league position and , thus , promotion .
these pleasures were on different levels .
from the purely results-driven perspective of a lifelong fan there was , of course , the strangely new but real expectation -lrb- usually delivered by sir brian -rrb- of actually coming away with a result !

' take heart ' over and above these levels was the genuine , as it proved , feeling that many of the clubs visited were engaged in " real " football .

but take heart .
some of the teams from that particular conference season did go on to higher levels - wycombe , yeovil , barnet , macclesfield , cheltenham and boston .
back then , only one team was promoted and there were no play-offs .
promotion went to the wire but the away games were memorable not only as new away-day experiences but also for the visible and vocal support which gave the team that extra edge .

the £ 2 charge for nottingham , derby and leicester comes in a report prepared for the county and city councils in these areas .
the fee would apply during morning and evening rush hours starting in 2016 .
steve calvert from nottinghamshire county council said the scheme would mean more investment in public transport in the region .
number plates the report said £ 128m could be raised annually for public transport in the three cities .
the congestion charge would involve monitoring motorists with roadside camera equipment using number plate recognition technology .
the zones would probably be located inside the a38 in derby , inside nottingham 's ring road and leicester 's outer ring road .
paul southby , regional director for the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- in the east midlands , said some employers feel additional costs like workplace parking fees or congestion charges can make some cities more expensive to operate in .
the study looked at the derby , leicester and nottingham areas together with other congested areas in leicestershire and southern derbyshire .
the councils will apply for £ 3m in government grants for a further study if they agreed to proceed with the initiative .
an earlier study showed that the average traffic delay in the derby , leicester and nottingham areas was just over two minutes per mile travelled at peak times .
councils and business leaders will discuss the plans over the next few weeks .
