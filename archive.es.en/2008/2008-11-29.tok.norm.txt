but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .

coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .

bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.11.2008 uneasy peace for berlin 's new ahmadi mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new mosque is not welcome by everyone in the neighborhood berlin 's first ahmadi mosque opened its doors in the former eastern side of the german capital last month .
the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.11.2008 uneasy peace for berlin 's new ahmadi mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new mosque is not welcome by everyone in the neighborhood berlin 's first ahmadi mosque opened its doors in the former eastern side of the german capital last month .
the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "

inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .

it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .

" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" while respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in thailand , the eu considers that these actions are totally inappropriate , " the statement said .
" they are seriously damaging the international image of thailand . "
thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .
somchai has declared a state of emergency at both airports .
police have cordoned off the main international airport , though they have not yet forced the protestors off the premises .
" to lay siege to the airports is extremely dangerous , " said the premier .
" it would make foreign countries lose confidence in thailand .
they will not fly their aircraft in or allow their citizens to travel here . "
somchai has also rejected calls for fresh elections .

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .

coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .

" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .

the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .

that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.11.2008 uneasy peace for berlin 's new ahmadi mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new mosque is not welcome by everyone in the neighborhood berlin 's first ahmadi mosque opened its doors in the former eastern side of the german capital last month .
the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.11.2008 uneasy peace for berlin 's new ahmadi mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new mosque is not welcome by everyone in the neighborhood berlin 's first ahmadi mosque opened its doors in the former eastern side of the german capital last month .
the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .

a statement by the eu presidency on friday , nov .
28 , said that the " european union condemns in the strongest terms the execution of mr. wo . "
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- deeply regrets the fact that china has not heeded the repeated calls by the european union and several of its member states for this execution to be deferred and for the death sentence passed against mr. wo to be commuted , " the statement said .
" the eu wishes to express its indignation at this execution , which comes just after the conclusion in beijing of the eu-china human rights dialogue , " the statement added .
minister calls execution " intentional affront " earlier on friday , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said that " from the point of view of the entire eu , this approach -lrb- of china -rrb- must be considered a virtually intentional affront . "
the fact that the execution was carried out on the day of the human rights dialogue between the european union and china " emphasizes the ruthlessness and coldness " of the decision , she added .
us-based chinese human rights organization , the dui hua foundation , said friday that wo had been allowed to see his family for the last time on thursday , and had then been taken to a judicial facility where he was to be executed .
a chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the state xinhua news agency on thursday that " chinese citizen wo weihan broke the laws of the people 's republic of china .
the sentence on him has been made by chinese courts according to the law . "
the information wo was convicted of passing on to taiwan included photocopies of publications accessed from the library of the chinese academy of sciences , as well as information about the health of a top chinese leader .
dui hua estimates that between 5,000 and 6,000 executions were carried out by the chinese state in 2007 .
the eu statement concluded that " this execution seriously undermines the spirit of trust and mutual respect required for this eu-china dialogue on human rights .

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.

the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "

in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .

we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.11.2008 uneasy peace for berlin 's new ahmadi mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new mosque is not welcome by everyone in the neighborhood berlin 's first ahmadi mosque opened its doors in the former eastern side of the german capital last month .
the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .

a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .

although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement by the eu presidency on friday , nov .

" -lrb- the eu -rrb- deeply regrets the fact that china has not heeded the repeated calls by the european union and several of its member states for this execution to be deferred and for the death sentence passed against mr. wo to be commuted , " the statement said .
" the eu wishes to express its indignation at this execution , which comes just after the conclusion in beijing of the eu-china human rights dialogue , " the statement added .
minister calls execution " intentional affront " earlier on friday , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said that " from the point of view of the entire eu , this approach -lrb- of china -rrb- must be considered a virtually intentional affront . "

" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .

coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .

the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .

the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .

a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .

" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , that the continued anti-government demonstrations were harmful to thailand 's image .
" while respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in thailand , the eu considers that these actions are totally inappropriate , " the statement said .
" they are seriously damaging the international image of thailand . "
thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .
somchai has declared a state of emergency at both airports .
police have cordoned off the main international airport , though they have not yet forced the protestors off the premises .
" to lay siege to the airports is extremely dangerous , " said the premier .
" it would make foreign countries lose confidence in thailand .
they will not fly their aircraft in or allow their citizens to travel here . "
somchai has also rejected calls for fresh elections .
" we call all parties in thailand to take steps to resolve the crisis and resort public order , respecting the rule of law and the country 's democratic institutions , " read the eu statement .
on saturday , somchai said he was willing to talk with protest leaders , but would refuse to resign or dissolve parliament . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .

coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .

coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?

" while respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in thailand , the eu considers that these actions are totally inappropriate , " the statement said .
" they are seriously damaging the international image of thailand . "
thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .
somchai has declared a state of emergency at both airports .
police have cordoned off the main international airport , though they have not yet forced the protestors off the premises .
" to lay siege to the airports is extremely dangerous , " said the premier .
" it would make foreign countries lose confidence in thailand .
they will not fly their aircraft in or allow their citizens to travel here . "
somchai has also rejected calls for fresh elections .
" we call all parties in thailand to take steps to resolve the crisis and resort public order , respecting the rule of law and the country 's democratic institutions , " read the eu statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "

inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .

at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .

similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .

29 , that the continued anti-government demonstrations were harmful to thailand 's image .
" while respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in thailand , the eu considers that these actions are totally inappropriate , " the statement said .
" they are seriously damaging the international image of thailand . "
thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .
somchai has declared a state of emergency at both airports .
police have cordoned off the main international airport , though they have not yet forced the protestors off the premises .
" to lay siege to the airports is extremely dangerous , " said the premier .
" it would make foreign countries lose confidence in thailand .
they will not fly their aircraft in or allow their citizens to travel here . "
somchai has also rejected calls for fresh elections .
" we call all parties in thailand to take steps to resolve the crisis and resort public order , respecting the rule of law and the country 's democratic institutions , " read the eu statement .

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.11.2008 germans split over " climate-friendly " big cars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german 's worst nightmare : traffic jams on the autobahn car-buyers are being tugged two ways in a german debate over carbon-dioxide emissions : should they buy cars for the fast lane , or downsize to smaller cars more suited to the slow lane of german autobahns ? the dilemma came to a head when chancellor angela merkel 's government debated an economic stimulus package in october . with global talks on a new climate-saving pact due next week in poland , the dispute underlined the conflict between ecology and the economy . germany initially wanted to grant two-year vehicle tax rebates to buyers of all cars with sophisticated technology to reduce and purify emissions , but an outcry from environmentalists halted the plan . the green camp was upset that even powerful sports utility vehicles with clean engines could claim the subsidy , while all cars would receive half the subsidy , no matter how polluting they were . one group , greenpeace , accused the government of encouraging " climate hog " motorists who drive heavy suvs and limousines . road vehicles account for about a fifth of germany 's carbon-dioxide emissions , so reducing car exhaust could help europe 's largest economy meet its climate goals . the export problem the trouble is , cars are one of germany 's main exports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world likes germany 's cars big and strong the cars that the world - and many germans - want to buy from germany are not small fuel sippers , but big , strong cars that eat up the kilometers and keep occupants in a steel cocoon of safety . despite localized speed limits and widespread congestion , there are still plenty of no-limit sections on german autobahns where the usual cruising speed in the fast lane is 160 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- or more . a few weeks ago , germany 's main lutheran church group asked pastors to set a good , green example to their flocks by limiting their autobahn speed to 120 kilometers per hour . however , there seems to be no sign that such restraint is catching on . speed limit allergy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign many germans do n't like to see germany 's auto industry regularly opposes efforts to introduce a national speed limit , and it suggests that environmentalists who call for weaker , slower cars are out of touch with ordinary germans . the industry has lobbied against earlier implementation of european union fuel-economy and carbon-dioxide standards for cars . " the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , that the continued anti-government demonstrations were harmful to thailand 's image .
" while respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in thailand , the eu considers that these actions are totally inappropriate , " the statement said .
" they are seriously damaging the international image of thailand . "
thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .
somchai has declared a state of emergency at both airports .
police have cordoned off the main international airport , though they have not yet forced the protestors off the premises .
" to lay siege to the airports is extremely dangerous , " said the premier .
" it would make foreign countries lose confidence in thailand .
they will not fly their aircraft in or allow their citizens to travel here . "
somchai has also rejected calls for fresh elections .
" we call all parties in thailand to take steps to resolve the crisis and resort public order , respecting the rule of law and the country 's democratic institutions , " read the eu statement .
on saturday , somchai said he was willing to talk with protest leaders , but would refuse to resign or dissolve parliament . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" families are coming to identify and claim the bodies , while those that can not be identified or nobody claims them will be interred by the mosque .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 29.11.2008 eu strongly condemns execution of chinese scientist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the execution coincided with eu-china human rights talks the execution of a chinese scientist and businessman who had been convicted of spying for taiwan has drawn strong condemnation from the european union , which had lobbied for the man 's release . wo weihan , 60 , who had lived in austria during the 1990s and whose two daughters are austrian citizens , was convicted in 2007 following a closed trial in which he had been charged with passing top secret chinese military data to taiwan .
a statement by the eu presidency on friday , nov .
28 , said that the " european union condemns in the strongest terms the execution of mr. wo . "
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- deeply regrets the fact that china has not heeded the repeated calls by the european union and several of its member states for this execution to be deferred and for the death sentence passed against mr. wo to be commuted , " the statement said .
" the eu wishes to express its indignation at this execution , which comes just after the conclusion in beijing of the eu-china human rights dialogue , " the statement added .
minister calls execution " intentional affront " earlier on friday , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said that " from the point of view of the entire eu , this approach -lrb- of china -rrb- must be considered a virtually intentional affront . "
the fact that the execution was carried out on the day of the human rights dialogue between the european union and china " emphasizes the ruthlessness and coldness " of the decision , she added .
us-based chinese human rights organization , the dui hua foundation , said friday that wo had been allowed to see his family for the last time on thursday , and had then been taken to a judicial facility where he was to be executed .

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a statement by the eu presidency on friday , nov .
28 , said that the " european union condemns in the strongest terms the execution of mr. wo . "
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- deeply regrets the fact that china has not heeded the repeated calls by the european union and several of its member states for this execution to be deferred and for the death sentence passed against mr. wo to be commuted , " the statement said .
" the eu wishes to express its indignation at this execution , which comes just after the conclusion in beijing of the eu-china human rights dialogue , " the statement added .
minister calls execution " intentional affront " earlier on friday , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said that " from the point of view of the entire eu , this approach -lrb- of china -rrb- must be considered a virtually intentional affront . "
the fact that the execution was carried out on the day of the human rights dialogue between the european union and china " emphasizes the ruthlessness and coldness " of the decision , she added .
us-based chinese human rights organization , the dui hua foundation , said friday that wo had been allowed to see his family for the last time on thursday , and had then been taken to a judicial facility where he was to be executed .
a chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the state xinhua news agency on thursday that " chinese citizen wo weihan broke the laws of the people 's republic of china .
the sentence on him has been made by chinese courts according to the law . "
the information wo was convicted of passing on to taiwan included photocopies of publications accessed from the library of the chinese academy of sciences , as well as information about the health of a top chinese leader .
dui hua estimates that between 5,000 and 6,000 executions were carried out by the chinese state in 2007 .
the eu statement concluded that " this execution seriously undermines the spirit of trust and mutual respect required for this eu-china dialogue on human rights .

" while respecting the right of protesting and without interfering in any way with the internal political debate in thailand , the eu considers that these actions are totally inappropriate , " the statement said .
" they are seriously damaging the international image of thailand . "
thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .
somchai has declared a state of emergency at both airports .
police have cordoned off the main international airport , though they have not yet forced the protestors off the premises .
" to lay siege to the airports is extremely dangerous , " said the premier .
" it would make foreign countries lose confidence in thailand .
they will not fly their aircraft in or allow their citizens to travel here . "
somchai has also rejected calls for fresh elections .
" we call all parties in thailand to take steps to resolve the crisis and resort public order , respecting the rule of law and the country 's democratic institutions , " read the eu statement .

jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thai prime minister somchai wongsawat on saturday said that the country risks international isolation is the demonstrators do not leave the airports in bangkok .
pm open to negotiation , not to new elections earlier this week , an opposition group called the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- seized the suvarnabhumi international airport and a smaller domestic hub , demanding somchai 's resignation .

inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .

it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .

at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .

" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .

" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

a statement by the eu presidency on friday , nov .
28 , said that the " european union condemns in the strongest terms the execution of mr. wo . "
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- deeply regrets the fact that china has not heeded the repeated calls by the european union and several of its member states for this execution to be deferred and for the death sentence passed against mr. wo to be commuted , " the statement said .
" the eu wishes to express its indignation at this execution , which comes just after the conclusion in beijing of the eu-china human rights dialogue , " the statement added .
minister calls execution " intentional affront " earlier on friday , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said that " from the point of view of the entire eu , this approach -lrb- of china -rrb- must be considered a virtually intentional affront . "
the fact that the execution was carried out on the day of the human rights dialogue between the european union and china " emphasizes the ruthlessness and coldness " of the decision , she added .
us-based chinese human rights organization , the dui hua foundation , said friday that wo had been allowed to see his family for the last time on thursday , and had then been taken to a judicial facility where he was to be executed .
a chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the state xinhua news agency on thursday that " chinese citizen wo weihan broke the laws of the people 's republic of china .
the sentence on him has been made by chinese courts according to the law . "
the information wo was convicted of passing on to taiwan included photocopies of publications accessed from the library of the chinese academy of sciences , as well as information about the health of a top chinese leader .
dui hua estimates that between 5,000 and 6,000 executions were carried out by the chinese state in 2007 .
the eu statement concluded that " this execution seriously undermines the spirit of trust and mutual respect required for this eu-china dialogue on human rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .

" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .

for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "

increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .

germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .
in september , hamburg-based designer jil sander 's eponymous luxury fashion house was bought buy onward , japan 's largest fashion apparel company .
looking great always in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans with style but it may not be all doom and gloom for germany 's fashion industry .
" people marry more in times of crisis , " sixtus said .
as a bridal wear designer , perhaps her business will really start to boom .
women 's wear designer schwarzer also thinks fashion has its place in a failing economy .
" we love to party and dress up in bad times , " she said . laura schweiger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most , but not all , of the sites are aimed at christians . in august this year , more than 2 million people clicked onto singlechrist.de in search of a partner .
" for most people the web is as much a part of life as shopping , " said friedhelm hensen , jr . , who launched singlechrist.de in 2007 .
hensen 's service , " the singles site by christians for christians , " reaches far more people than a regional newspaper 's lonely hearts column ever does , say media experts .
hensen said he 's delighted when he receives a wedding announcement from a couple who have met through singlechrist.de.
it happens on average about once a month , but he reckons the figure is probably higher because not all couples get around to informing him when they have found their " partner for life . "
surfing for love bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some couples , there have been wedding bells another online matchmaking outlet , christian soulmates , provides an easy way for its members to meet other quality singles on the net .
" we ask every user to fill out a questionnaire that will assist other users in getting to know you , " it states .
" once members create their profiles , our matching technology can provide them with instantaneous matches based on their pre-selected dating criteria , " said an official .
" it 's true internet romances can and do happen , " states christian soulmates , which adds a cautionary note from the bible -lrb- romans 8:25 -rrb- : " but , if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . "
plenty to choose from competition is fierce in the lonely hearts business .
sites like agape24.de , christpart.de , cpdienst.de , feuerflamme de , christ-such-christ.de and germanfriendfinder.com are all in the business of helping lonely people find partners with whom they can share their faith - and love .
profiles created by members often contain details about a person 's church congregation , his or her best loved song or favorite bible passage , as well as info on their home , age and hobbies etc .
a catholic site declares : " catholic matchmaking is very much alive .
we are living at a time when people are too busy even to find time to mingle with each other .
for this reason catholic online matchmaking has grown to great heights ! "
non-christians also searching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also started dating sites not only christians cruise the internet for love .
increasing numbers of germany 's more than 200,000 jews now make use of the web when seeking partners .
jewish-singles.de and jewish-dating.de are two online sites offering help for people looking for lasting love .
germany 's first islamic marriage institute was created in 2005 by munich-based samer fahed , who is of german-palestinian descent .
he claims his online site has attracted thousands of clients , including in some cases , recent women converts to islam .
the institute specializes in matching people belonging to the country 's near 3.5 million-strong muslim community .
the muslimlife.eu site helps " match " those who are genuinely interested in starting a family , he said .
occasionally their profiles reveal whether they read the koran on a regular basis , or have ever made a pilgrimage to mecca .
but when non-muslim men eager to marry muslim women show interest , they are politely told muslim women are n't permitted to marry non-muslim men unless they convert to islam , fahed said . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the eu seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions , polish coal miners are worried - and defiant . coal provides 94 percent of poland 's energy and some 117,000 jobs , a fact that 's come into focus as the country prepares to host global talks on a new climate-saving pact .
" everyone wants to live in healthy air , " said waclaw czerkawski , deputy head of poland 's trade union of miners .
" but you have to find some kind of balance , and you ca n't do that at the expense of the economy , industry and jobs . "
poland 's government agrees .
together with other ex-communist eu nations and italy , it has threatened to block plans to cut the bloc 's carbon dioxide pollution to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
french president nicolas sarkozy 's initial proposal would boost domestic electricity prices by up to 90 percent , the poles complain .
sarkozy and eastern european leaders are to meet on dec .
6 to iron out differences , just as delegates from nearly 200 countries discuss new steps to fight global warming in poznan , poland .
coal mining a polish tradition for poland , europe 's biggest coal producer and eastern europe 's largest economy , coal mining is n't just a source of electricity and jobs , but a way of life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking for ways to cut co2 emissions in the coal-rich silesia region , mining dates back to the middle ages .
" from the simple miner to the highest union official , we 've always thought mining should be stronger because it 's the basis of energy in poland , " czerkawski said .
" there are no other sources of energy .
" every attempt to close down a mine comes with protest , because it 's not only a place of work for the miner , but the entire community , " he told dpa news agency .
poland and other eu newcomers from central and eastern europe want credit for reducing co2 emissions in the 1990s , when their highly-polluting communist-era industries collapsed .
they also demand the eu pay more attention to the economic situation in less affluent member states .
in its dispute with brussels , poland rejected a proposal that would allow some free co2 emission permits until 2015 .
france had hoped the proposal would sway the country in favor of the climate package , but polish officials claimed the proposal did n't guarantee low electricity prices .
other eu countries " do n't understand " czerkawski said the eu 's demands come from countries that do n't understand poland 's predicament , and how indispensable coal is to poland 's energy sector .
" those countries ca n't understand our problems , because those problems are already behind them , " czerkawski said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in the industry say coal is the energy of the future in communist-era poland , nearly 500,000 coal workers enjoyed generous benefits and prestige as the elite of the proletariat masses .
coal was in such high demand that miners were made to work on saturdays and the industry was so vital that they were given their own national holiday .
after the iron curtain fell in 1989 , some 50 mines were shut down and thousands of jobs were cut to meet profit targets .
many in the industry say coal is still the fuel of the future , but that it needs further modernization .
coal the energy of the future ?
" coal will still long be the main source of energy in polish power plants , " said ryszard fedorowski , spokesman of the katowice coal holding company .
" but we are also looking for ways to process coal to turn it into so-called clean coal .
the european union can enforce limits , but we have no fears because we 're thinking of new ways . "
while the industry may be looking towards the future , it is rooted in what czerkawski calls a " very strong " sense of tradition .
" from experience , they are always ready to fight for their place of work , " he said .
" but it does n't mean they 're not afraid . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the german government is trying to stop effective co2 limits and acting as an errand boy for incorrigible auto executives , " accused juergen resch , head of the german environmentalist lobby group duh . the controversy in berlin over vehicle-tax rebates , which has rumbled on for two years , has not gone away . under pressure , merkel chose to delay .
she has promised the half subsidy to all new-car buyers , and said that her government will next year fine-tune the low-emissions element of its subsidy program . the tax dilemma the squabble seems set to continue next year , with environmentalists pushing for a tax scheme that acts as an incentive to buy lower-powered cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will banning this car help germany 's green record ?
two states - bavaria , home of bmw , and baden-wuerttemberg , home of mercedes-benz and porsche - pressed ahead this month and said they would distribute the tax rebates in the form that environmentalists oppose . the auto industry is also pushing for another incentive which it contends will be good for industry and good for the climate at the same time : a buy-in of polluting older cars . martin winterkorn , chief executive of volkswagen , has claimed that scrapping every car made before 1999 currently on german roads would reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 11.2 million tons . general motors ' german subsidiary opel has also argued for a buy-in as a way to help the stumbling industry . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.11.2008 german conservative premier : our policies focus on achievers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says it 's important to support those who work hard to make it in an exclusive interview with dw-tv , peter mueller , the conservative premier of the state of saarland , talks about why his party is best prepared to handle the current economic crisis . peter mueller is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and has been premier of saarland since 1999 .
state elections will take place on aug .
30 , 2009 , less than a month ahead of the german general election , which is likely to take place on sept .
27 , 2009 .
mueller , who has made himself a name as an economic expert , talked to dw-tv 's alexander kudascheff about his party 's strategy to deal with the current economic crisis . dw-tv : we 're facing an international financial crisis of unknown extent and the threat of a wider economic crisis .
is it the job of the chancellor to deal with that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller says his party needs to focus on its core strengths peter mueller : in times of crisis , the government has to take on responsibility because action is called for : something the government does better than the opposition .
i believe the german government 's management , and the measures we 've agreed to deal with the financial and economic crises , are the right way forward .
but we will have to wait and see how things develop .
no one can predict that . there has been criticism of the chancellor 's stance and her approach , from france , for example .
they say she 's too hands off , too reluctant to spend money , for example , on a fiscal stimulus package .
do you share that view ? we have put together a 500-billion-euro -lrb- $ 644-billion -rrb- financial safety package , for the banks and fiscal stimulus program worth 50 billion euros , which is on its way through parliament .
and there are a whole host of other measures regarding bank guarantees and inter-bank lending .
you have to be careful in a situation like this not to harm the economy by inflating borrowing for example , because that 's something future generations will have to pay for , and nobody wants that . but would n't lowering taxes be a possibility ?
maybe drop the extra tax that pays for reunification - to try to kick-start the economy ? we do need to find ways of reviving the domestic economy and we have introduced some - for example , exemptions from vehicle tax for those who buy a new car within the next six months .
but a general reform of the tax system or the abolition of that extra tax are n't necessary yet . the last three years have seen the chancellor 's popularity at an incredibly high level - almost as high as the german president 's .
but her party , the cdu has never really managed to get much above the 35-or-so percent it received in the last elections .
is that a gap that will be impossible to close ? this government is a grand coalition .
typically , that helps to strengthen smaller parties .
that 's what we 're seeing now , but the closer we come to the elections , the more the chancellor 's positive image will benefit our party . could this be good for the two main parties ?
will people see them as anchors of stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how attractive is the cdu i do think this crisis represents an opportunity for the main parties .
it 's a chance for them , especially for my party , the cdu , to show it stands for the right economic and social policies .
our social market economy model is both economic and social in nature ; it has stood the test of time , and it is now being tested again .
i think that will attract voters to our party .
no one knows what will happen in the future , but i think this is an opportunity for the main parties , especially the christian democrats . the spd 's new leader , franz muentefering , says now is the time for social democratic solutions , meaning state-level solutions .
what answers do your christian democrats have in the run-up to the party congress ? i do n't agree with him .
past lessons have taught us two things ; firstly , socialism makes people poor and robs them of their personal liberties - freedom of opinion and freedom of political association .
in recent weeks and months , we 've seen that capitalism and an unbridled market can lead to an economic crisis ; that 's why we need a third way .
socialism is not the answer , although many in the spd still support it , nor is pure capitalism .
the answer is the social market economy , the middle way .
that 's the cdu 's line , and that 's why i believe our time is now . your draft election program , due to be approved at the party conference in stuttgart , includes a call for a return to the principles of the honest merchant .
is that the cdu 's answer ? it 's one answer , one among many , but it is a good one .
greed took over on the financial markets ; highly complicated products were created to bring in as much profit as possible at the cost of others .
that 's not the way honest merchants trade - and now we know what it leads to .
another cdu answer must be the principle of reward for achievement over wealth redistribution .
fair reward is more important than fair distribution .
our policies focus on achievers , people who get up for work every morning .
we need to take care of them and address their needs . has this crisis revived the role of the state and , perhaps surprisingly , restored people 's belief and trust in the ability of politicians to change things ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global economy requires global approaches to an extent , this is the restoration of politics .
we 're seeing the death throes of the idea that the market can regulate itself fairly .
it was never an idea i believed in , and nor did the cdu .
but many in our society did believe it .
people recognize that 's not the case , so there 's a revival of trust in the political system .
but now , we have to see politics globally .
the world just got smaller , we 're facing a truly global recession for the first time and so the solutions need to be global , too . you recently said the chancellor was holding back because she 's waiting to see what happens in germany .
other countries are busy intervening in their markets .
is this a lack of co-ordination ? the chancellor is holding back , that 's correct .
when it comes to economic packages to stimulate demand and how much money is needed for that , others have announced their plans .
they are just announcements , but it may be that they go farther than us .
in plenty of other areas , the chancellor certainly does not hold back , like more transparency and stricter controls on the financial markets .
angela merkel was always a determined and tireless champion of these causes , even before the crisis hit . ten months to go till the parliamentary election : the grand coalition has been negative for your party and for the spd . how can you make sure that wo n't continue after the poll in 2009 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with her favorite coalition partner , fdp leader guido westerwelle we are aiming for a center-right coalition after the elections .
i think it is for the best when there is a clear shift in one political direction .
we could achieve more in a coalition with the -lrb- free-market liberal -rrb- free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- - on tax reforms , for example .
things that are n't possible with the spd .
but i also think a healthy democracy needs a healthy opposition to survive .
a grand coalition must always be an exception , and ending the grand coalition is one of our election aims . in your state , saarland , oskar lafontaine , your social democratic predecessor and the current left party leader , says he 'll run against you .
does he stand a chance ? oskar lafontaine is on record as saying he wants to become state premier so he can run saarland as he did when he was last in office .
back then , unemployment was above-average , groowth was below average , and spending on education was slashed , with teachers cut as student numbers were growing .
i 'm absolutely certain people do not want that again , and that 's why i 'm looking forward to the election next year . interview : alexander kudascheff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 29.11.2008 bad times for german hem lines ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fashion houses are n't looking very attractive these days germany 's fashion sector is sinking deeper into peril during the current financial crisis .
the country 's luxury fashion houses are tightening their bejeweled belts and the most stylish women may soon be " recessionistas . " based outside of stuttgart , hugo boss has announced it is delaying the construction of a new warehouse as it watches its worth plunge .
meanwhile , escada 's shares fell by 6.7 percent after bruno saelzer , the munich-based luxury company 's ceo , told daily newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung that it would be selling its subsidiary , primera . " it 's by far the worst time that the fashion industry has ever experienced , " he said .
of course the fashion disaster is not just in germany .
high-end fashion houses the world over are feeling the effects of the shattered economy .
famous for its camel , red and black check raincoats , british-based burberry , for example , has seen its shares hit a six-year low , admitting that sales are " very volatile and the daily swings are very significant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uncertain about its financial future , hugo boss is treading carefully but despite tumbling stocks and cost-cutting talk , escada 's ceo , for one , has faith that women will still buy luxury looks .
in her editorial for the december issue of german " vogue , " arguably the style bible for luxury fashionistas , editor-in-chief christiane arp references a recent study about germans ' desires to underline her belief that costly clothes will live on .
according to the study , germans are not longing most for world peace or a stable economy these days .
rather , their wishes are small-scale ones that they can make come true all by themselves .
arp adds fashion to this list of longing , hinting that perhaps germans , while unable to inject millions into their country 's economy , will satisfy their desire for fancy frocks and pricey handbags instead .
" recession chic " the next trend ? while the desolate financial situation is undoubtedly hurting fashion sales , there is also the question of how it is impacting design .
with penny-pinching becoming the name of the game , will fashion houses be forced to dream up noticeably different clothing confections ?
susanne sixtus , a lecturer at dusseldorf 's private fashion school and an independent designer , said shoppers may become increasingly quality-focused , buying clothing that they know will last a long time .
" short-lived trendy clothing will not be popular either , " she said , adding that timeless pieces may become even more sought after .
bildunterschrift : " my clothes never make women look overdressed , " says schwarzer the classic little black dresses in dusseldorf designer barbara schwarzer 's current collection seem to speak to german women who are becoming more mindful of the money they spend on fashion . " comfortable and travel-friendly " is how schwarzer describes her collection .
" and the little black dresses have sleeves .
that 's very important . "
cocktail dresses with added fabric do seem like a bright idea when attending christmas parties in chilly temperatures , and with this design detail schwarzer exposes germans ' practical side when it comes to fashion .
" germans are so practical , " said sixtus , who primarily designs bridal wear at her own atelier .
" they buy wedding dresses that they can dye another color to wear for another event , or they purchase two-piece dresses and wear the top part again to a friend 's wedding . "
in view of the current economic crisis , sixtus wondered if germans might take this practicality to an even higher level when shopping for clothes .
more money , more leg one thing that seems uncertain is whether extravagant and even sexy trends will have a place in the failing economy .
" hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , " the old saying goes , and according to mara michel , manager of the association of german fashion and textile designers -lrb- vdmd -rrb- , this certainly applies in germany .
" in the 20s between the wars , there was an absolute lust for life and this strongly influenced fashion , " she said .
" more leg , more cleavage and more emphasis on the body . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hem lines rise and fall with the stock market , or so the saying goes so will designers be shelving their mini-skirt sketches in favor of floor-length gowns ?
sixtus does not think the impact the financial situation could have on design will be perceived much in germany , simply because there are hardly any top , well-known designers here .
" germans are not artists when it comes to fashion , " she said .
" we are known for engineering . "
why has the country come up short in fashion ?
" no companies want to invest in fashion , " sixtus said .
" the textile industry has been in a crisis for twenty years . "
vdmd manager michel agreed that the branch had been suffering long before lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy in september .
" collections have not been able to afford production and have not received any advance financing , " michel said .
" there is a general deficit in financial support . "
globalization is also presenting a threat .

" families are coming to identify and claim the bodies , while those that can not be identified or nobody claims them will be interred by the mosque .

the building and the religious group are putting religious tolerance to the test . a 13-meter-high -lrb- 43-foot -rrb- minaret competes for attention alongside pillars advertising the fast food outlets at a busy intersection in pankow , a north-eastern suburb of berlin .
inside the mosque , the call to friday prayer echoes as men fall to their knees .
upstairs , women turn to the loudspeakers relaying the imam 's chant .
it is not audible from the streets , where the mosque draws suspicious disapproval .
the khadija mosque , which opened on oct .
16 , has met with strong opposition ever since its inception in 2006 .
the first purpose-built mosque to open in former east germany , it provides a new center for berlin 's ahmadi community .
ahmadiyya islam is a reform movement founded in india in the 19th century .
the ahmadi are not recognized by mainstream muslims , and many have left pakistan where they face religious persecution .
symbol of tolerance ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadiyya muslims pray at the ground-breaking ceremony for the khadija mosque at the opening ceremony , berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , described the mosque as an icon of religious and cultural tolerance .
at the same time , 500 police officers were present to keep demonstrators at bay .
a residents ' group campaigning against the ahmadiyya muslims perceives them to be an authoritarian sect , with no respect for women 's rights .
over the last two years , the group has staged demonstrations and lodged appeals against the mosque .
although they say their motives are not racist , the campaign has been tainted by its appeal to right-wing organizations .
the mosque has also received letters of support from people within the community .
now imam abdul basit tariq has announced two " days of the open mosque , " for people to visit and ask questions .
" i hope that with our personal contact and personal friendly behaviour we are going to win the heart of the people , " he said .
after the prayer session , dure shahwar talked about her former life in pakistan .
" we had to leave because of religious problems , " she said .
around 200 ahmadis live in berlin .
" until the mosque was opened , we had just one house to pray in , " shahwar said .
" now this mosque is here , i hope more ahmadis will move to berlin . "
group accused of extremism back in his office , abdul tariq talks of the difficulty of teaching islam in europe .
" there are so many things in european society that are strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
" you 're not allowed to have a boyfriend or girlfriend , -lrb- ... -rrb- it 's punishable . "
similarly , he said drinking alcohol and visiting discos are out of bounds for young muslims .
" as imam , i have to have an eye on them so they do n't do anything that is strictly forbidden in islam , " he said .
opposition groups criticize ahmaddiya islam for being extremist and authoritarian .
tariq said this is far from the truth .
" we are a reform community , " he said , adding that they are fighting fundamentalism .
" we do n't believe in holy war , we do n't believe that for fornication , one should be stoned to death . "
tariq said he can understand the animosity towards islam , and blames the actions of an extremist minority .
" people have no information about islam , they are totally misinformed , " he said .
" that 's why , when they heard that pakistani people were coming here , they were terrified . "
in former east germany , this fear is compounded by the fact that religious expression had been banned under communist rule .
dure shahwar said he sees an opportunity in this .
" i think people in eastern germany are more interested in us , " she said .
" because they had no religion , they are curious . "
in her opinion , people in western germany have stronger prejudices .
" peaceful coexistence " so far it is questionable how many of pankow 's residents will visit during the open house .
nino bartczak , 24 , lives in an apartment block across the road .
he does n't think a mosque belongs in the neighborhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honor killings and arranged marriage have heightened debate over islamic law in germany " the people here are german through and through , " he said .
" they are older people , with a more nationalist attitude .
i suppose i need to accept it , i live here .
but i 'm not happy about it . "
others , such as fish shop owner michael fleck , are relieved there has been little trouble so far .
" we were worried it would become a meeting point for left- or right-wing extremists , " he said .
glancing towards the mosque , his colleague jens poloni added : " they leave us alone and we leave them alone .
it 's a peaceful coexistence at the moment .
i hope it stays that way . "
the government estimates that between 3 and 3.4 million muslims live in germany , the vast majority of whom are of turkish descent .
around 160 purpose-built mosques exist in germany , alongside a further 2,600 buildings converted into makeshift places of worship .
there are plans to build almost 200 additional mosques .
debate over status of women within germany , a fierce debate is taking place about the strictures of islamic law , especially regarding the status of women .
a series of so-called honor killings have focused the issue , and the practice of arranged marriage is receiving media attention .
the german constitution safeguards religious freedom , and also grants every religious denomination the right to build dedicated places of worship . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exact sequence of events remains unclear , but security personnel are establishing a picture of how the operation was planned and executed .
all the signs , officials say , point to a well-planned action carried out by a highly trained , determined group .
the men appeared to have surveyed their targets in advance and were well-versed in the use of weapons and explosives , a indian commando said .
their intention , he said , was " to create and spread terror " .
investigators believe that a large group of men arrived in mumbai from the sea around 2100 local time .
they believe that a larger ship - possibly a hijacked vessel , possibly an accomplice ship - brought them close to the shore before they switched to smaller dinghies .
once ashore , they split into two- , three- and four-man groups to attack pre-selected targets .
several of the attackers were caught on cctv .
footage showed mainly young men , carrying automatic weapons and large rucksacks .
officials said the rucksacks contained grenades , extra ammunition , plastic explosives and food supplies .
multiple attacks reports suggest the attacks happened within minutes of each other . "
by using such weapons and explosives , it is obvious that they would have been trained somewhere " unidentified commando in mumbai one of the first targets was the chhatrapati shivaji railway station , where at least two men fired automatic weapons and threw grenades at crowds of people waiting in the main hall .
a second group opened fire at café leopold , a popular restaurant , while a third seized nariman house , a business complex housing a jewish outreach centre , taking several people hostage .
a fourth group - or , some reports say , the same one that attacked the station nearby - struck the cama and albless hospital for women and children .
a number of drive-by shootings were also reported across the city .
by around 2200 local time gun fire was being reported at two of the city 's luxury hotels - the oberoi-trident and the taj mahal palace .
some guests managed to escape what they described as indiscriminate fire , while others sheltered in their rooms .
others were shot - exactly how many remains unclear .
the gunmen were looking for americans and britons , guests trapped at the hotels said , and hostages were taken in both locations .
gunfire and small blasts continued to be heard at both hotels over the next several hours , as indian troops surrounded the buildings .
fires broke out in both hotels .
' trained somewhere ' in the early hours of thursday , commando teams entered both hotels to try to find the gunmen .
attackers at the taj mahal appeared familiar with the layout and moved continually around the building , firing their weapons .
they definitely appeared to have been trained , the commando said .
" not everybody can fire the ak series of weapons , not everybody can throw grenades like that , " he said .
" by using such weapons and explosives , it is obvious that they would have been trained somewhere . "
the commandos went through the hotels floor by floor and room by room to flush out the attackers and free trapped guests and staff .
reports that particular locations had been made safe were several times followed by fresh bursts of gunfire and explosions , and the crisis entered a third day .
by friday afternoon -lrb- local time -rrb- , indian security forces said that they had control of the oberoi .
multiple bodies had been found , they said .
later that night , troops regained control of nariman house .
the bodies of five hostages were found inside .
in the early hours of saturday , soldiers launched a renewed assault on the taj mahal palace hotel .
by mid-morning , they said that three gunmen were dead and they believed the siege was over - although room-to-room checks were necessary to confirm this .

the exact sequence of events remains unclear , but security personnel are establishing a picture of how the operation was planned and executed .
all the signs , officials say , point to a well-planned action carried out by a highly trained , determined group .
the men appeared to have surveyed their targets in advance and were well-versed in the use of weapons and explosives , a indian commando said .
their intention , he said , was " to create and spread terror " .
investigators believe that a large group of men arrived in mumbai from the sea around 2100 local time .
they believe that a larger ship - possibly a hijacked vessel , possibly an accomplice ship - brought them close to the shore before they switched to smaller dinghies .
once ashore , they split into two- , three- and four-man groups to attack pre-selected targets .
several of the attackers were caught on cctv .
footage showed mainly young men , carrying automatic weapons and large rucksacks .
officials said the rucksacks contained grenades , extra ammunition , plastic explosives and food supplies .
multiple attacks reports suggest the attacks happened within minutes of each other .
by using such weapons and explosives , it is obvious that they would have been trained somewhere unidentified commando in mumbai one of the first targets was the chhatrapati shivaji railway station , where at least two men fired automatic weapons and threw grenades at crowds of people waiting in the main hall .

hundreds of troops have been deployed to sites around mumbai some guests managed to escape what they described as indiscriminate fire , while others sheltered in their rooms .
others were shot - exactly how many remains unclear .
the gunmen were looking for americans and britons , guests trapped at the hotels said , and hostages were taken in both locations .
gunfire and small blasts continued to be heard at both hotels over the next several hours , as indian troops surrounded the buildings .
fires broke out in both hotels .

by around 2200 local time gun fire was being reported at two of the city 's luxury hotels - the oberoi-trident and the taj mahal palace .
hundreds of troops have been deployed to sites around mumbai some guests managed to escape what they described as indiscriminate fire , while others sheltered in their rooms .
others were shot - exactly how many remains unclear .
the gunmen were looking for americans and britons , guests trapped at the hotels said , and hostages were taken in both locations .
gunfire and small blasts continued to be heard at both hotels over the next several hours , as indian troops surrounded the buildings .
fires broke out in both hotels .
' trained somewhere ' in the early hours of thursday , commando teams entered both hotels to try to find the gunmen .
attackers at the taj mahal appeared familiar with the layout and moved continually around the building , firing their weapons .
they definitely appeared to have been trained , the commando said .
" not everybody can fire the ak series of weapons , not everybody can throw grenades like that , " he said .
" by using such weapons and explosives , it is obvious that they would have been trained somewhere . "
the commandos went through the hotels floor by floor and room by room to flush out the attackers and free trapped guests and staff .
reports that particular locations had been made safe were several times followed by fresh bursts of gunfire and explosions , and the crisis entered a third day .
by friday afternoon -lrb- local time -rrb- , indian security forces said that they had control of the oberoi .
multiple bodies had been found , they said .
later that night , troops regained control of nariman house .
the bodies of five hostages were found inside .
in the early hours of saturday , soldiers launched a renewed assault on the taj mahal palace hotel .
by mid-morning , they said that three gunmen were dead and they believed the siege was over - although room-to-room checks were necessary to confirm this .

the commandos suspect that the militants knew the hotel well because they were very mobile during the course of the siege , he says , making it extremely difficult for security forces to secure an area in order to evacuate guests .

the toll could rise further , they say .
at least 22 foreigners are known to have died , including victims from germany , japan , canada , australia , italy , singapore , thailand and france .

a claim of responsibility for this week 's attacks - the worst in india 's commercial capital since nearly 200 people were killed in a series of bombings in 2006 - has been made by a previously unknown group calling itself the deccan mujahideen .
however , most intelligence officials are keeping an open mind as the attacks have thrown up conflicting clues , bbc security correspondent frank gardner says .

advertisement lynne shaw : " i thought we were going to be executed " a welsh couple caught up in the attacks in mumbai have spoken how " little decisions " and " timing " saved their lives over in india .
lynne and ken shaw , from penarth , vale of glamorgan , arrived home from their ordeal on friday on a flight arranged by the british consulate .
the couple had to hide under a table as attackers stormed the taj mahal palace hotel where they had been staying .
they were rescued by the indian army in the morning after the attacks .
at least 170 people have been killed after gunmen targeted at least seven sites in the indian city late on wednesday .
" little decisions that night just timing saved our lives , " said mrs shaw , who works as a bichemist in llandough hospital , near cardiff .
" we 'd chosen to eat in the chinese restaurant at about 8.30pm and we were finishing our meal at about 10pm and i heard gunfire in the corridor .
the couple were led through a " rabbit warren of corridors " in the hotel .
" i think we were the only ones that had reacted to it because it was just a short burst and all of sudden there was a very long burst of gunfire .
" one of the staff said ' get down !
get down ! '
and then the kitchen staff were beckoning to us for us to come out through the kitchen area . "
the couple , who had stayed at the hotel twice before during previous trips to india , were led through the rabbit warren of corridors at the back of the building and led to a conference area called the chamber where they remained for several hours as the carnage unfolded around them .
" from that moment on things started to deteriorate , " explained mrs shaw .
" at about 2.30am they announced they were going to try and move us out .
" they wanted the women to go first and i said no - i was going to stay with my husband because i felt i could cope with it if we were together .
if i 'd chosen to wear high shoes and a dress it would n't have been quite so easy to move around and escape from things that were happening to us lynne shaw " but if we were separated and something happened i was going to be much happier to be with him . "
they were taken to another kitchen area before being led along a corridor to what they thought was safety in groups of six .
" the group ahead of us were at the end of the corridor , which was probably about 20 yards long and i was held probably 10 yards into the corridor standing talking to a member of staff , " she said .
" my husband was behind me and all of a sudden gunfire broke out in the corridor and they had executed a six-year-old in front of his parents .
" my life was saved because as i was running i stumbled and i think that really saved me as i fell back into the room .
sniper fire " if i 'd chosen to wear high shoes and a dress it would n't have been quite so easy to move around and escape from things that were happening to us . "
they dived into the nearest room and for the next six hours hid under a table as the sounds of gunfire and explosions rang out around them .
" at 9am men suddenly burst into the room , they had rifles and they were screaming ' stand up !
stand up !
put your hands up ! ' and of course people were scrambling to their feet .
hopefully life will feel normal again because it certainly does n't feel normal at the moment lynne shaw " then they started to drive us to a stairwell and at that stage i thought this is the end .
" as we were being herded down stairwells , i thought they just want to get us all crammed together so they can take us all out at the same time .
" it was very , very confusing who was friends and who were terrorists . "
luckily , the husband and wife were in the hands of indian army personnel and they were led to safety at the front of the hotel where they were put onto a bus .
unfortunately , as they thought they were nearing safety the bus came under sniper fire and they couple had to run to safety .
in the crossfire in the street they ran into two australians who took them to their national consulate and from there they were taken to the british consulate who arranged their emergency passports and papers and a flight home .
" we were just so lucky that where we had chosen to eat , rather than the indian restaurant where they had immediately gone in and started machine gunning everybody - we were across the corridor , " said mrs shaw .
' surreal ' experience " the fact that we were slow eating our meal and a couple of minutes later - if we 'd been leaving - we 'd have walked straight into them .
" it was just surreal - you could n't believe it was happening .
" all our belongings are still there - i 'd be very surprised if we saw them again - but at least we 're alive and 140 people are not .
" i was hopeful until about six in the morning , ken was acting as my body armour most of the night , and we whispered to each other that we really did n't think we were going to get out of this .
" and then at 9am when they burst in , then i was seriously frightened because i thought this really is the end .
" it was n't until they gave me a glass of champagne about 20 minutes into the flight , that was the first time i wept because i knew how lucky we had been to get out .
" we have n't slept for three nights .
it 's been surreal , the whole thing .
" hopefully life will feel normal again because it certainly does n't feel normal at the moment . "

the 66-year-old , who grew up in israel and is also known for his championing of palestinian rights , took charge of richard wagner 's tristan und isolde .
associated press reviewer mike silverman said the conductor " drew inspired playing from the orchestra " .
" tristan is an opera about death .
there is nothing more democratic in the world than death , " barenboim told reporters .
" it is that death , the fear of death and the looking for death as the only possible way to solve the entanglement in which they find , this is the motor of the opera .
" in the end , it comes to everyone .
he who spends his life thinking about death misses out on one of the most forceful dimensions of human existence . "
' thrilled and delighted ' barenboim said he was " thrilled " with barack obama 's election in 2001 , barenboim performed extracts from tristan und isolde in israel , breaking an unofficial ban on works by wagner , whose anti-semitic views influenced adolf hitler .
in january , he accepted honorary palestinian citizenship .
he said he was " thrilled and delighted " to see barack obama win the us election , but was not expecting the president-elect to find a quick solution to the region 's troubles .
" it 's unrealistic to hope that he will achieve a solution to all these problems , " he said .
" i think the palestinian-israeli conflict can be solved only by the israelis and the palestinians , but it has to have the backing of the rest of the world .
it can not be an initiative from the outside . "
he said his reaction to mr obama 's election came from his early experiences in the us .
" i read with my own eyes at the entrance of a golf club in miami in 1958 - a sign that said : ' no jews , no blacks and no dogs allowed . '
so there is quite a development in all that . "
barenboim brought his own berlin cast , including katarina dalayman as isolde and peter seifert as tristan , to the new york met , and he will conduct five further performances over the next three weeks .
but the soprano and tenor received less glowing reviews than their mentor .
silverman said dalayman 's voice " had trouble rising above the orchestra " at times , while seifert 's voice threatened to give out by the end of the opera .
during his us trip , barenboim will also perform two concerts as a soloist with the boston symphony and an all-liszt recital in philadelphia , chicago and new york .

the 66-year-old , who grew up in israel and is also known for his championing of palestinian rights , took charge of richard wagner 's tristan und isolde .
associated press reviewer mike silverman said the conductor " drew inspired playing from the orchestra " .
" tristan is an opera about death .
there is nothing more democratic in the world than death , " barenboim told reporters .
" it is that death , the fear of death and the looking for death as the only possible way to solve the entanglement in which they find , this is the motor of the opera .
" in the end , it comes to everyone .
he who spends his life thinking about death misses out on one of the most forceful dimensions of human existence . "
' thrilled and delighted ' barenboim said he was " thrilled " with barack obama 's election in 2001 , barenboim performed extracts from tristan und isolde in israel , breaking an unofficial ban on works by wagner , whose anti-semitic views influenced adolf hitler .
in january , he accepted honorary palestinian citizenship .
he said he was " thrilled and delighted " to see barack obama win the us election , but was not expecting the president-elect to find a quick solution to the region 's troubles .
" it 's unrealistic to hope that he will achieve a solution to all these problems , " he said .
" i think the palestinian-israeli conflict can be solved only by the israelis and the palestinians , but it has to have the backing of the rest of the world .
it can not be an initiative from the outside . "
he said his reaction to mr obama 's election came from his early experiences in the us .
" i read with my own eyes at the entrance of a golf club in miami in 1958 - a sign that said : ' no jews , no blacks and no dogs allowed . '
so there is quite a development in all that . "
barenboim brought his own berlin cast , including katarina dalayman as isolde and peter seifert as tristan , to the new york met , and he will conduct five further performances over the next three weeks .
but the soprano and tenor received less glowing reviews than their mentor .
silverman said dalayman 's voice " had trouble rising above the orchestra " at times , while seifert 's voice threatened to give out by the end of the opera .
during his us trip , barenboim will also perform two concerts as a soloist with the boston symphony and an all-liszt recital in philadelphia , chicago and new york .
