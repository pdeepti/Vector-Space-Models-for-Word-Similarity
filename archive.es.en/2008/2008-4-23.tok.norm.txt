the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .

the case has been referred to criminal prosecutors in frankfurt . the allegations , which involve one bank employee , focus on sales of ikb shares made just before the bank announced last july that was suffering from the collapse of the us subprime mortgage market . in the week following the july 27 , 2007 announcement , ikb 's stock dropped from 21.97 euros to 12.65 euros a share .
the deutsche bank subsidiary specializes in loans to small and medium-sized companies . germany 's state development bank kfw , also a major shareholder in ikb , has since bailed out the lender several times with a total of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- in aid packages .
other banks contributed additional funds to keep the flailing lender afloat . lender 's losses lower than expected according to reports , however , ikb is not fairing quite as badly as expected , with a deficit of 200 million euros for the 2007-2008 fiscal year instead of the 800 million that had been predicted . " if it 's true that a trader from the deutsche bank group speculated on the drop in ikb stock prices shortly before -lsb- deutsche bank ceo joseph -rsb- ackermann sounded an alarm at bafin that things were heading downhill , then that 's at least a strange coincidence , if not more , " ekkehardt wenger , a banking law professor , told german public broadcaster ard . if proven , insider trading can be punished with a fine or a jail sentence of up to five years , according to the prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .

he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .

the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .

while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .

after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .

" the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.

despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has been referred to criminal prosecutors in frankfurt . the allegations , which involve one bank employee , focus on sales of ikb shares made just before the bank announced last july that was suffering from the collapse of the us subprime mortgage market . in the week following the july 27 , 2007 announcement , ikb 's stock dropped from 21.97 euros to 12.65 euros a share .
the deutsche bank subsidiary specializes in loans to small and medium-sized companies . germany 's state development bank kfw , also a major shareholder in ikb , has since bailed out the lender several times with a total of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- in aid packages .
other banks contributed additional funds to keep the flailing lender afloat . lender 's losses lower than expected according to reports , however , ikb is not fairing quite as badly as expected , with a deficit of 200 million euros for the 2007-2008 fiscal year instead of the 800 million that had been predicted . " if it 's true that a trader from the deutsche bank group speculated on the drop in ikb stock prices shortly before -lsb- deutsche bank ceo joseph -rsb- ackermann sounded an alarm at bafin that things were heading downhill , then that 's at least a strange coincidence , if not more , " ekkehardt wenger , a banking law professor , told german public broadcaster ard . if proven , insider trading can be punished with a fine or a jail sentence of up to five years , according to the prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the changes in german troops ' orders could have consequences on the security situation , gertz said . official reports gloss over facts , says union chief he also strongly criticized the equipment the bundeswehr has at its disposal in afghanistan , saying that it was in urgent need of heavy weapons and equipment . none of the six german helicopters on site is working properly on some days , said gertz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers need better equipment , said gertz " we 're tired of always having to complain about how far away we are from fulfilling our missions and then having to read government reports about how great everything is going , " he added . parties split on reinforcements the head of the social democrats parliamentary group , peter struck , and spd defense expert rainer arnold both said their party was willing to consider an increase in troops . arnold , however , said there was " no chance " that any changes would be made before parliament takes its summer recess . apart from the six tornado jets active in reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , germany has consistently refused to send troops to the more dangerous southern region in all but emergency situations .
the bundeswehr 's mandate limits its activity to peacekeeping and rebuilding . in agreement with berlin politicians , gertz said he strongly opposed germany deploying troops to southern afghanistan . " the thought that the fight against terror in southern afghanistan can be won militarily is as realistic as trying to ride a dead horse , " he said . the united states , canada and the netherlands are among the countries with troops stationed in southern afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.04.2008 schalke reveal dutchman fred rutten as new coach großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands up if lack of job security and intense pressure to succeed do n't bother you dutchman fred rutten will leave the relative sanity of his homeland to enter the crazy world of the bundesliga at the end of the season .
the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .
the clock will be ticking , fred bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad results could speed rutten to the end of his tenure fred rutten may also want to take note of the significance of the recurring " two-year tenure " theme at this point .
after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .
the question remains as to what rutten , a coach with limited top job experience behind him at a dutch first division side , can hope to achieve in that time span in one of the most demanding jobs in german soccer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has been referred to criminal prosecutors in frankfurt . the allegations , which involve one bank employee , focus on sales of ikb shares made just before the bank announced last july that was suffering from the collapse of the us subprime mortgage market . in the week following the july 27 , 2007 announcement , ikb 's stock dropped from 21.97 euros to 12.65 euros a share .
the deutsche bank subsidiary specializes in loans to small and medium-sized companies . germany 's state development bank kfw , also a major shareholder in ikb , has since bailed out the lender several times with a total of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- in aid packages .
other banks contributed additional funds to keep the flailing lender afloat . lender 's losses lower than expected according to reports , however , ikb is not fairing quite as badly as expected , with a deficit of 200 million euros for the 2007-2008 fiscal year instead of the 800 million that had been predicted . " if it 's true that a trader from the deutsche bank group speculated on the drop in ikb stock prices shortly before -lsb- deutsche bank ceo joseph -rsb- ackermann sounded an alarm at bafin that things were heading downhill , then that 's at least a strange coincidence , if not more , " ekkehardt wenger , a banking law professor , told german public broadcaster ard . if proven , insider trading can be punished with a fine or a jail sentence of up to five years , according to the prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami .

the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .
the clock will be ticking , fred bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad results could speed rutten to the end of his tenure fred rutten may also want to take note of the significance of the recurring " two-year tenure " theme at this point .
after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .
the question remains as to what rutten , a coach with limited top job experience behind him at a dutch first division side , can hope to achieve in that time span in one of the most demanding jobs in german soccer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami .

the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.04.2008 schalke reveal dutchman fred rutten as new coach großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands up if lack of job security and intense pressure to succeed do n't bother you dutchman fred rutten will leave the relative sanity of his homeland to enter the crazy world of the bundesliga at the end of the season .
the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .

the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .

while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .

after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .

the changes in german troops ' orders could have consequences on the security situation , gertz said . official reports gloss over facts , says union chief he also strongly criticized the equipment the bundeswehr has at its disposal in afghanistan , saying that it was in urgent need of heavy weapons and equipment . none of the six german helicopters on site is working properly on some days , said gertz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers need better equipment , said gertz " we 're tired of always having to complain about how far away we are from fulfilling our missions and then having to read government reports about how great everything is going , " he added . parties split on reinforcements the head of the social democrats parliamentary group , peter struck , and spd defense expert rainer arnold both said their party was willing to consider an increase in troops . arnold , however , said there was " no chance " that any changes would be made before parliament takes its summer recess . apart from the six tornado jets active in reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , germany has consistently refused to send troops to the more dangerous southern region in all but emergency situations .
the bundeswehr 's mandate limits its activity to peacekeeping and rebuilding . in agreement with berlin politicians , gertz said he strongly opposed germany deploying troops to southern afghanistan . " the thought that the fight against terror in southern afghanistan can be won militarily is as realistic as trying to ride a dead horse , " he said . the united states , canada and the netherlands are among the countries with troops stationed in southern afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .

while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .
the clock will be ticking , fred bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad results could speed rutten to the end of his tenure fred rutten may also want to take note of the significance of the recurring " two-year tenure " theme at this point .
after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .

in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .
the clock will be ticking , fred bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad results could speed rutten to the end of his tenure fred rutten may also want to take note of the significance of the recurring " two-year tenure " theme at this point .
after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .
the question remains as to what rutten , a coach with limited top job experience behind him at a dutch first division side , can hope to achieve in that time span in one of the most demanding jobs in german soccer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has been referred to criminal prosecutors in frankfurt . the allegations , which involve one bank employee , focus on sales of ikb shares made just before the bank announced last july that was suffering from the collapse of the us subprime mortgage market . in the week following the july 27 , 2007 announcement , ikb 's stock dropped from 21.97 euros to 12.65 euros a share .
the deutsche bank subsidiary specializes in loans to small and medium-sized companies . germany 's state development bank kfw , also a major shareholder in ikb , has since bailed out the lender several times with a total of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- in aid packages .
other banks contributed additional funds to keep the flailing lender afloat . lender 's losses lower than expected according to reports , however , ikb is not fairing quite as badly as expected , with a deficit of 200 million euros for the 2007-2008 fiscal year instead of the 800 million that had been predicted . " if it 's true that a trader from the deutsche bank group speculated on the drop in ikb stock prices shortly before -lsb- deutsche bank ceo joseph -rsb- ackermann sounded an alarm at bafin that things were heading downhill , then that 's at least a strange coincidence , if not more , " ekkehardt wenger , a banking law professor , told german public broadcaster ard . if proven , insider trading can be punished with a fine or a jail sentence of up to five years , according to the prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .

continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .

" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo .

having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .

" top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the changes in german troops ' orders could have consequences on the security situation , gertz said . official reports gloss over facts , says union chief he also strongly criticized the equipment the bundeswehr has at its disposal in afghanistan , saying that it was in urgent need of heavy weapons and equipment . none of the six german helicopters on site is working properly on some days , said gertz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers need better equipment , said gertz " we 're tired of always having to complain about how far away we are from fulfilling our missions and then having to read government reports about how great everything is going , " he added . parties split on reinforcements the head of the social democrats parliamentary group , peter struck , and spd defense expert rainer arnold both said their party was willing to consider an increase in troops . arnold , however , said there was " no chance " that any changes would be made before parliament takes its summer recess . apart from the six tornado jets active in reconnaissance missions throughout afghanistan , germany has consistently refused to send troops to the more dangerous southern region in all but emergency situations .
the bundeswehr 's mandate limits its activity to peacekeeping and rebuilding . in agreement with berlin politicians , gertz said he strongly opposed germany deploying troops to southern afghanistan .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has been referred to criminal prosecutors in frankfurt . the allegations , which involve one bank employee , focus on sales of ikb shares made just before the bank announced last july that was suffering from the collapse of the us subprime mortgage market . in the week following the july 27 , 2007 announcement , ikb 's stock dropped from 21.97 euros to 12.65 euros a share .
the deutsche bank subsidiary specializes in loans to small and medium-sized companies . germany 's state development bank kfw , also a major shareholder in ikb , has since bailed out the lender several times with a total of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- in aid packages .
other banks contributed additional funds to keep the flailing lender afloat . lender 's losses lower than expected according to reports , however , ikb is not fairing quite as badly as expected , with a deficit of 200 million euros for the 2007-2008 fiscal year instead of the 800 million that had been predicted . " if it 's true that a trader from the deutsche bank group speculated on the drop in ikb stock prices shortly before -lsb- deutsche bank ceo joseph -rsb- ackermann sounded an alarm at bafin that things were heading downhill , then that 's at least a strange coincidence , if not more , " ekkehardt wenger , a banking law professor , told german public broadcaster ard . if proven , insider trading can be punished with a fine or a jail sentence of up to five years , according to the prosecutor 's office . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.04.2008 minister rejects urgent call for reinforcements in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wo n't accomplish its mission with 3,500 troops , the military union chief said germany 's military union has said it would be irresponsible of the government not to send at least 500 more troops and better equipment to northern afghanistan .
but politicians say they wo n't deploy additional soldiers . the head of germany 's military union , bernhard gertz , on tuesday , april 22 , accused the government of not acting in the interest of the troops it has stationed in the war-torn country . the some 3,200 german troops in northern afghanistan are not enough to secure peace and rebuild the country 's infrastructure , he said . gertz 's call for 500 additional soldiers immediately , and 400 to 800 more further in the future to serve as a buffer , was sharply rejected by defense minister franz josef jung , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . politicians stick to mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gertz said the war on terror in southern afghanistan ca n't be won militarily " we have a clear mandate from the german parliament with a limit of 3,500 " troops , said jung . christian schmidt , germany 's deputy defense minister and member of the christian social union , said that the current mandate was sufficient to ensure security . " the tasks can be fulfilled with the current number " of soldiers , he told the daily passauer neue presse . the mandate , up for renewal in october , limits germany 's involvement to the country 's northern region , where it is active in peacekeeping , reconstruction and police training . several hundred troops are set for deployment in a nato quick response force this summer , but gertz said others are being withdrawn in order to keep the bundeswehr 's deployment under the 3,500-solider limit set by the current parliamentary mandate .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 23.04.2008 nato expansion : a model for stability or a grab for power ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all nato members are currently in favor of the flag flying over ukraine and georgia nato 's proposed expansion into the balkans and eastwards into ukraine and georgia is causing tensions between the alliance and russia and within nato itself .
what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization .

" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.04.2008 schalke reveal dutchman fred rutten as new coach großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands up if lack of job security and intense pressure to succeed do n't bother you dutchman fred rutten will leave the relative sanity of his homeland to enter the crazy world of the bundesliga at the end of the season .
the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .
the clock will be ticking , fred bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad results could speed rutten to the end of his tenure fred rutten may also want to take note of the significance of the recurring " two-year tenure " theme at this point .
after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .
the question remains as to what rutten , a coach with limited top job experience behind him at a dutch first division side , can hope to achieve in that time span in one of the most demanding jobs in german soccer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .

the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .
a coach 's standing does not seem to make much difference to the outcome either .
jupp heynkes , a world cup and european championship winner as a player with germany , managed the club for two seasons but could n't replicate the bundesliga-winning formula he enjoyed as coach of bayern munich or european cup success he had as real madrid chief .

after schalke paid half a million euros in compensation to fc twente to take away their coach , the german club then offered rutten - you 've guessed it - a two-year contract .
schalke is a club which does not insist on immediate success but does put a limited timescale on those they employ to achieve it .

the current fc twente coach will lead schalke 04 's next quest for the league title . it takes a brave man to take on the hopes and dreams of schalke 04 's emotional following .
while bayern munich fans get upset when their team does not deliver the league title every season - as is their apparent right - schalke fans start every campaign with an almost physical yearning for championship success after half-a-century of heartbreak .
just ask recently departed coach mirko slomka .
he may have taken schalke to the brink of the bundesliga title in 2007 and the champions league quarter-finals this year , but the holy grail remained beyond him during his two seasons with the club .
the 5-1 thrashing by werder bremen on april 12 may have been the last nail , but the coffin he was eventually shipped out in was constructed from championship failure .
enter fred rutten .
the name of the coach who will attempt to bring the title to gelsenkirchen on the 51st anniversary of their last league success was formally announced by the club on wednesday , april 23 .
when the dutchman eventually arrives during the summer break , after his contract with dutch league side fc twente comes to an end , he would be wise to notice that the doors through which he enters are of the revolving kind and that they are well-oiled .
a long list of distinguished failures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not close enough : slomka was another schalke nearly-man rutten is the latest in a long line of men to sip from the glittering but seemingly poisoned chalice offered by schalke chairman josef schnusenberg .
some succumbed to its deadly contents earlier than others .
while mirko slomka lasted almost two years , his predecessor , the stop-gap manager oliver reck , failed to clock up a month .
the incumbent before him , ralf rangnick , also held a two-year tenure but , despite a runners-up place in the league in 2005 and a dfb cup win in the same campaign , he was sacked for his inability to land the coveted league title .

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
having been slower than russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it can not have been overlooked by nato that a presence in both ukraine and georgia would go some way to catching up . should both countries join the alliance , nato would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the caspian sea through georgia and offer support to ukraine in any future disputes with russia over gas . europeans delay membership russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within nato itself .
at the bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm-twisting from president bush , european leaders - wary of alienating an increasingly assertive russia - denied coveted pre-membership status to georgia and ukraine , at least for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans led by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel , the europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on russia 's southern flank . there are growing concerns that a split within nato along european and us lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging . " france and germany should take a stand , " said dan plesch .
" russia is far more of a traditional european state than turkey , and yet , it is turkey not russia that is now regarded as european .
this goes against history and is a dangerous path . in this respect , poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the us against russia . " all these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely ukraine and georgia will become nato members anytime soon , even with ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in december . however , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion - which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation - may be as defining as the final accession itself . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is planned and is everything as it seems ? when the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party . for most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the soviet union .
not long after the signing of the treaty which brought nato into being , the cold war intensified and pitched nato members into a standoff with the warsaw pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , nato 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders . since the removal of the soviet threat , nato 's goal in europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
in 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia and slovenia - all formerly part of the soviet union or the warsaw pact . the alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
a further five nations have been short-listed for nato accession this year .
while the membership of albania , croatia and macedonia would mark a concerted effort by nato to shore up the shaky balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into ukraine and , further still , georgia has raised questions about nato 's current motives and approach to its former cold war adversary , russia . nato sells expansion as a means to stability bildunterschrift : the leaders of nato : bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ? the official line from nato is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
the states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability . " the balkan region has been jolted anew by kosovo 's recent secession from serbia , " charles kupchan , a senior fellow for europe studies at the council on foreign relations , in washington , told dw-world.de.
" nato membership for albania , croatia , and macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty . as in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . " but dan plesch , director of the center for international studies and diplomacy , in london , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to nato 's plans than the official explanation implies . " the public explanation ignores russia , " plesch said .
" while nato itself , and especially its european members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around russia , this can not be said for some in the united states .
for some in the us , nato is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in washington . " the proposed expansion of nato 's strategic defense forces further into former soviet territory has angered russia .
despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with us president george w. bush , outgoing russian premier vladimir putin still believes nato expansion into ukraine and georgia would be a direct threat to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin reiterated his position to expansion in bucharest " the appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " putin said at the nato summit in bucharest earlier this month .
he also challenged nato 's argument that russia would benefit from having stable , western-backed democracies as neighbors .
" the entry of latvia into nato has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " putin said .
" nato is not a democratizer . " dan plesch agrees that nato 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" the latvian case just shows that nato has a problem when it overextends itself .
continuing problems in far-flung outposts of nato expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . " russia : playing the game or under threat ? russia has reacted to the growing possibility of nato expanding into ukraine and georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of soviet-era cold war rhetoric .
in february , putin warned that russia could take " retaliatory action " should ukraine become a member of nato , suggesting moscow might aim its missiles at kiev . at the beginning of april , a senior russian general reiterated putin 's message by saying that russia would take " military and other " steps , should ukraine and georgia join nato . some experts have speculated that president putin 's reactions are an assertion of russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
others believe that putin and his successor , dmitry medvedev , are genuinely concerned - and have reason to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko has bush 's support " nato is not seeking to encircle russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " charles kupchan said .
" in reality , however , nato enlargement does bring with it greater western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the euro-atlantic community .
this realignment is one of the reasons that russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes moscow 's geopolitical sway .
in that way nato enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of russian ambition . " there is growing concern that nato expansion could spark a new arms race with russia , leading to the kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs . " the worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between nato and russia , but this outcome is remote , " said kupchan .
" what is more likely is increased russian meddling in the caucasus and less russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and iran , to missile defense and kosovo . " nato considering energy security in future missions even if nato 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for nato 's existing members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no gas today : russia cut ukraine off in january 2005 nato 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .

the world food program called the crisis a " silent tsunami . " top eu leaders , including european commission president jose manuel barroso and japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda , voiced their worries about the prices of food , oil and other commodities on wednesday , april 23 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world food program said many more people are now threatend by hunger " summit leaders noted with strong concern the trends of high prices of natural resources and commodities , in particular , prices of food and oil , which could slow down the growth in -lsb- the -rsb- global economy and have negative effects on developed and developing countries , " they said in a joint statement following their summit in tokyo .
the statement was also signed by prime minister janez jansa of slovenia , whose country currently holds the eu presidency . the world leaders also noted the acute effects soaring prices are having on developing nations ' attempts to overcome poverty . many now on verge of hunger the united nations ' world food program has called rising food prices a " silent tsunami " that has pushed an extra 100 million people to the brink of hunger . " this is the new face of hunger - the millions of people who were not in the ' urgent hunger ' category six months ago but now are , " wfp executive director josette sheeran said in a statement on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many countries rely on food aid , like somalia here , in 2005 also on tuesday , the european commission announced it would offer another 117.25 million euros -lrb- $ 185.6 million -rrb- in food aid to lessen the impact of rising food prices on the world 's most vulnerable people . that announcement came after the commission 's biggest food aid package - 160 million euros - was pledged in march . barroso said a significant drop in international development aid for a second straight year in 2007 exacerbated the problem . " when you add to this negative developments that we have watched recently - the recent elements concerning food prices - we have reasons to be sincerely concerned , " barroso told reporters in tokyo . he added that the global community needed to be mobilized to renew their commitments of development aid , particularly for africa . immense food price hikes food prices have risen sharply since the end of 2007 , triggered in part by a growing population , increasing consumption in emerging economies such as china and india , more frequent and intense droughts and floods due to climate change , and by the popularity of biofuels as oil prices soar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richer nations are also feeling the food price squeeze high prices for stples , such as rice , have led to riots and protests in countries from haiti to indonesia . japan , which imports more than half its food , is particularly concerned about spiraling food prices and said it would place the issue on the agenda at the summit of the group of eight rich nations , which it will host in july . fukuda said he and eu leaders had also agreed to raise the food issue before the world trade organization . " convergence " on climate protection barroso , fukuda and slovenia 's jansa also focused their attention on the climate during their talks in tokyo , with the eu and japan agreeing that a " highly ambitious and binding international approach " was needed to replace the kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and japan did n't reach a binding deal to fight climate change barroso called the joint statement a " convergence " in stances taken by the eu and japan . " what we reached today was very important , " barroso said .
" there must be binding targets . " however , the japan-eu statement did not announce specific figures for binding cuts of greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming . the eu has proposed global emission reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
japan , like the united states , has said it is too early to fix specific numbers for future emission cuts .
after criticism from environmentalists , tokyo announced earlier this year that it would define its own national target for emissions reductions after 2012 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bbc investigation has uncovered growing levels of credit card crime committed on the internet .

the card details are then offered for sale to the highest bidder - either on web forums or via internet relay chat .
adele darling was one victim of this crime .

the website concerned is hosted in pakistan , its members are anonymous and no-one seems able to close it down .
out of control typically the card numbers being offered for sale will be used by fraudsters to purchase small , high value electrical goods , things like mp3 players , games consoles and mobile phones , anything which can be easily sold on online or at a car boot sale .

andrew goodwill is a fraud expert with software company the 3rd man .

according to the retailers , most police forces simply are not interested in dealing with this kind of crime .

the first she knew that something was wrong was when strange transactions began appearing on her statement .
the shop where she had bought the keyboard had been hacked , and her details had been sold to fraudsters .
bbc news found mrs darling 's details on a web forum run by hackers .
she was horrified to find her name , address , phone number , email address and credit card number up for sale .
mrs darling 's card has now been stopped by her bank .
but she is still worried that her identity was so blatantly available to criminals .
the website concerned is hosted in pakistan , its members are anonymous and no-one seems able to close it down .
out of control typically the card numbers being offered for sale will be used by fraudsters to purchase small , high value electrical goods , things like mp3 players , games consoles and mobile phones , anything which can be easily sold on online or at a car boot sale .
the bbc found fraudsters were ordering thousands of pounds worth of goods using hacked credit cards .

fraud expert andrew goodwill andrew goodwill is a fraud expert with software company the 3rd man .
he says this kind of crime is out of control .
many experts say the uk falls well behind the us and europe in policing the internet .
last year , the house of lords science and technology committee said that the internet had become a " playground for criminals " .
imrg , the body which represents online retailers agrees , and is calling for action .
according to the retailers , most police forces simply are not interested in dealing with this kind of crime .
the one exception is the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit -lrb- dcpcu -rrb- , a small police team set up and funded by the banking industry .
officers from the dcpcu admit that internet fraud is on the rise but say they are doing their best to tackle it .
but critics say not enough is being done and are calling on the government to fund a dedicated e-crime unit .
meanwhile , online retailers are being told they need to be aware of the threat from hackers .
and consumers are being advised to take steps to protect themselves such as always checking their bank and credit card statements and only shopping on secure sites .

"
for 87 years wrexham fc has ensured that north wales has had a presence in the football league .
in a welsh nation that regards rugby as its number one sport , north walians have always put football first and pride in the achievements of their only league club has been central to this .
not many years ago wrexham was synonymous with fa cup giant killing and long is the list of welsh internationals who have played for the club .
' involve and engage ' but now we fans must accept that the inevitable has become a reality with relegation to the blue square premiership .
with relegation will come recriminations .
brian carey possibly could and should have done more in the summer to improve a squad that had performed so badly the previous season and only saved itself on the last day .
brian little inherited the worst squad in the league and his desperate attempt to bolster the playing staff in january did not have the desired effect .
with little money made available wrexham ended up with a mixed bag of moderately talented journey men lacking the fans ' loyalty to the shirt and singularly failing to gel into a team .
the problems though are not solely of this season 's making and go back to august 2006 when the club came out of administration .
the new owners promised much and presented the fans with a ten point plan for the future with talk of championship ambitions .
despite some improvement off the field , the past two seasons have been a disaster where it matters most to supporters - on the pitch .
equally concerning is that nothing has been done to secure the long term future of the racecourse ground and that the much publicised redevelopment is taking longer to implement than envisaged .
disappointingly , in march the owners alienated many of the fans by rejecting without explanation an offer from the wrexham supporters trust to invest a much needed £ 300k in the club for a minority shareholding .
for the future the fans ' message to the club 's owners is simple enough .
you ca n't do it all on your own .
there are thousands of fans who love this club and want it to be successful - involve and engage with them much more than you have done and give them representation and a real stake in the club .
bring in board members who can contribute time , ideas , skills and investment , back your manager with a realistic budget and build closer partnerships with the council , the welsh assembly and sports bodies to secure funding and support for an international stadium in north wales .
wrexham has always been a football town and shared in the highs and lows of the team .
two years ago when extinction was a real possibility our present situation would have been gratefully accepted .
we coped with and survived administration and will do the same with relegation .
other teams have dropped into the conference and come back stronger .
together wrexham will do the same , sooner rather than later . "

for 87 years wrexham fc has ensured that north wales has had a presence in the football league .
in a welsh nation that regards rugby as its number one sport , north walians have always put football first and pride in the achievements of their only league club has been central to this .
not many years ago wrexham was synonymous with fa cup giant killing and long is the list of welsh internationals who have played for the club .
' involve and engage ' but now we fans must accept that the inevitable has become a reality with relegation to the blue square premiership .
with relegation will come recriminations .
brian carey possibly could and should have done more in the summer to improve a squad that had performed so badly the previous season and only saved itself on the last day .
brian little inherited the worst squad in the league and his desperate attempt to bolster the playing staff in january did not have the desired effect .
with little money made available wrexham ended up with a mixed bag of moderately talented journey men lacking the fans ' loyalty to the shirt and singularly failing to gel into a team .
the problems though are not solely of this season 's making and go back to august 2006 when the club came out of administration .
the new owners promised much and presented the fans with a ten point plan for the future with talk of championship ambitions .
despite some improvement off the field , the past two seasons have been a disaster where it matters most to supporters - on the pitch .
equally concerning is that nothing has been done to secure the long term future of the racecourse ground and that the much publicised redevelopment is taking longer to implement than envisaged .
the club should listen to its fans , says david preece disappointingly , in march the owners alienated many of the fans by rejecting without explanation an offer from the wrexham supporters trust to invest a much needed £ 300k in the club for a minority shareholding .
for the future the fans ' message to the club 's owners is simple enough .
you ca n't do it all on your own .
there are thousands of fans who love this club and want it to be successful - involve and engage with them much more than you have done and give them representation and a real stake in the club .
bring in board members who can contribute time , ideas , skills and investment , back your manager with a realistic budget and build closer partnerships with the council , the welsh assembly and sports bodies to secure funding and support for an international stadium in north wales .
wrexham has always been a football town and shared in the highs and lows of the team .
two years ago when extinction was a real possibility our present situation would have been gratefully accepted .
we coped with and survived administration and will do the same with relegation .
other teams have dropped into the conference and come back stronger .

david davies memorial institute director prof nick wheeler said it was a privilege to have mr evans deliver its annual lecture in aberystwyth .
mr evans is president of the international crisis group .
he has played a key role in developing the concept of state responsibility to protect all people from violence .
in his speech on wednesday mr evans will set out the case for a new approach to conflict resolution and examine the current status of the idea of the " responsibility to protect . "
this concept was developed to help the international community to avoid any future situations where the world stood by in the face of genocide and mass killing , as in cambodia in the 1970s - a situation mr evans denounces as a state 's " licence to kill " its own people .
to yet again ignore that distress and agony , and to once again make ' never again ' a cry that rings totally emptily , is to diminish that common humanity to the point of despair former australian foreign minister gareth evans mr evans advocates the innate responsibility of all states to their people - and crucially that if individual states " can not meet that responsibility , through either ill-will or incapacity , it then falls on the wider international community to take the appropriate action , " including the use of force .
he will argue that a focus on protection rather than intervention means taking the perspective of victims , with the added responsibility of always trying to prevent these crises from occurring .
having spent six months as a student travelling across asia , africa and the middle east in the late 1960s , he recalls since meeting old friends and acquaintances from every country he visited except for cambodia - leading to the conclusion that they were all killed under pol pot 's regime .
prof wheeler said : " he has worked tirelessly and with great vision , both as a former foreign minister and now as the head of one of the world 's leading ngos -lrb- non-governmental organisations -rrb- in the field of international security , to promote a more peaceful world . "
the david davies memorial institute of international studies forms part of the department of international politics at aberystwyth university - concentrating its research on international trust-building , nuclear non-proliferation , international legitimacy and the responsibility to protect .

david davies memorial institute director prof nick wheeler said it was a privilege to have mr evans deliver its annual lecture in aberystwyth .
mr evans is president of the international crisis group .
he has played a key role in developing the concept of state responsibility to protect all people from violence .
in his speech on wednesday mr evans will set out the case for a new approach to conflict resolution and examine the current status of the idea of the " responsibility to protect . "
this concept was developed to help the international community to avoid any future situations where the world stood by in the face of genocide and mass killing , as in cambodia in the 1970s - a situation mr evans denounces as a state 's " licence to kill " its own people .
to yet again ignore that distress and agony , and to once again make ' never again ' a cry that rings totally emptily , is to diminish that common humanity to the point of despair former australian foreign minister gareth evans mr evans advocates the innate responsibility of all states to their people - and crucially that if individual states " can not meet that responsibility , through either ill-will or incapacity , it then falls on the wider international community to take the appropriate action , " including the use of force .
he will argue that a focus on protection rather than intervention means taking the perspective of victims , with the added responsibility of always trying to prevent these crises from occurring .
having spent six months as a student travelling across asia , africa and the middle east in the late 1960s , he recalls since meeting old friends and acquaintances from every country he visited except for cambodia - leading to the conclusion that they were all killed under pol pot 's regime .
prof wheeler said : " he has worked tirelessly and with great vision , both as a former foreign minister and now as the head of one of the world 's leading ngos -lrb- non-governmental organisations -rrb- in the field of international security , to promote a more peaceful world . "
the david davies memorial institute of international studies forms part of the department of international politics at aberystwyth university - concentrating its research on international trust-building , nuclear non-proliferation , international legitimacy and the responsibility to protect .

polzeath residents say their lives are blighted by the so-called " snob-yob " holidaymakers ' parties on the beach .
in the summer more than 1,000 , mainly public school , youngsters can descend on the beach at night .
officers say they will use powers under a 1933 act and warn they will take parents to court if they do not take responsibility for their children .
they 're treating the police like the leaders of a creche pete smith in the past police have written to the head teachers of public schools asking them to speak to their pupils about their behaviour while on holiday .
they have also created dispersal areas to tackle the problem .
head chef at the waterfront restaurant rohan kelly believes the responsibility lies with the parents .
" the parents drop them on the beach with a crate of beers and leave them there for the rest of the night , it 's the parents ' fault i think . "
the local neighbourhood team leader sgt robin moorcroft says they have not used the act to arrest a parent yet .
" it 's mainly a deterrent and to get a message across to the parents that police are n't down there to act as babysitters , " he said .
another resident , pete smith , who lives close to the beach thinks the police force does not have the manpower to invoke the act .
" it 's parents ' responsibility , they 're treating the police like the leaders of a creche - it 's great in theory but they just have n't got the facilities or staffing levels , " he said .
but sgt moorcroft says they will use the provisions of the children and young persons act 1933 if they have to - the relevant part of the legislation says that anyone who is responsible for a youngster , who neglects , abandons or exposes them in a manner that could cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health can be prosecuted .
" we want them to come and enjoy polzeath and the facilities it has to offer but we do expect a level of responsibility and if people cross that line then we will have to deal with it . "

officers say they will use powers under a 1933 act and warn they will take parents to court if they do not take responsibility for their children .
they 're treating the police like the leaders of a creche pete smith in the past police have written to the head teachers of public schools asking them to speak to their pupils about their behaviour while on holiday .
they have also created dispersal areas to tackle the problem .
head chef at the waterfront restaurant rohan kelly believes the responsibility lies with the parents .
" the parents drop them on the beach with a crate of beers and leave them there for the rest of the night , it 's the parents ' fault i think . "
the local neighbourhood team leader sgt robin moorcroft says they have not used the act to arrest a parent yet .
" it 's mainly a deterrent and to get a message across to the parents that police are n't down there to act as babysitters , " he said .
another resident , pete smith , who lives close to the beach thinks the police force does not have the manpower to invoke the act .
" it 's parents ' responsibility , they 're treating the police like the leaders of a creche - it 's great in theory but they just have n't got the facilities or staffing levels , " he said .
but sgt moorcroft says they will use the provisions of the children and young persons act 1933 if they have to - the relevant part of the legislation says that anyone who is responsible for a youngster , who neglects , abandons or exposes them in a manner that could cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health can be prosecuted .
" we want them to come and enjoy polzeath and the facilities it has to offer but we do expect a level of responsibility and if people cross that line then we will have to deal with it . "

polzeath residents say their lives are blighted by the so-called " snob-yob " holidaymakers ' parties on the beach .
in the summer more than 1,000 , mainly public school , youngsters can descend on the beach at night .
officers say they will use powers under a 1933 act and warn they will take parents to court if they do not take responsibility for their children .
they 're treating the police like the leaders of a creche pete smith in the past police have written to the head teachers of public schools asking them to speak to their pupils about their behaviour while on holiday .
they have also created dispersal areas to tackle the problem .
head chef at the waterfront restaurant rohan kelly believes the responsibility lies with the parents .
" the parents drop them on the beach with a crate of beers and leave them there for the rest of the night , it 's the parents ' fault i think . "
the local neighbourhood team leader sgt robin moorcroft says they have not used the act to arrest a parent yet .
" it 's mainly a deterrent and to get a message across to the parents that police are n't down there to act as babysitters , " he said .
another resident , pete smith , who lives close to the beach thinks the police force does not have the manpower to invoke the act .
" it 's parents ' responsibility , they 're treating the police like the leaders of a creche - it 's great in theory but they just have n't got the facilities or staffing levels , " he said .
but sgt moorcroft says they will use the provisions of the children and young persons act 1933 if they have to - the relevant part of the legislation says that anyone who is responsible for a youngster , who neglects , abandons or exposes them in a manner that could cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health can be prosecuted .
" we want them to come and enjoy polzeath and the facilities it has to offer but we do expect a level of responsibility and if people cross that line then we will have to deal with it . "

in a statement , ebay claimed that in january , craigslist executives took actions that " unfairly diluted ebay 's economic interest by more than 10 % " .
no details of those actions were given by ebay .
in its company blog , craigslist said it was surprised and disappointed by ebay 's " unfounded allegations " .
the company said ebay 's legal action " came to us out of the blue " .
we have always treated ebay fairly as a minority shareholder , and plan to continue doing so craigslist craigslist 's silent emergence the case , which is sealed , has been filed in a court in delaware , where craigslist is registered .
in a press statement , ebay claims that craigslist 's founder craig newmark and its chief executive jim buckmaster adopted unspecified measures in january that have disadvantaged ebay and its investment .
preserve our investment ebay 's general counsel mike jacobson said : " since negotiating our investment with craigslist 's board in 2004 , we have acted openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder , so we were surprised by these recent unilateral actions .
he continues : " we are asking the delaware court to rescind these recent actions in order to protect ebay 's stockholders and preserve our investment . "
craigslist , the seventh most popular english-language page on the web , hit back in a blog .
" we have always treated ebay fairly as a minority shareholder , and plan to continue doing so , despite this unfortunate development , " it said .
" ebay has absolutely no reason to feel threatened - unless a hostile takeover of craigslist , or the sale of ebay 's stake in craigslist to an unfriendly party , is their ultimate goal . "
uneasy relationship the relationship between craigslist and ebay has not always been an easy one .
online auction site ebay acquired a 28.4 % stake when it bought shares from a former employee who had been given equity by mr newmark .
mr newmark and mr buckmaster give away for free most of the services that craigslist provides .
they have always appeared to have little ambition to milk profits from the popular site , which offers everything from houses for rental to nannies for hire .
a year after the deal was completed , ebay , which had said it wanted to learn from craigslist , started kijiji.com , a rival international network of classified ad sites that now sells ads in all 50 us states .

he is seeking to be released from detention while waiting for the start of his trial , which is expected to take place later this year .
khieu samphan was arrested in november on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the khmer rouge regime ruled cambodia between 1975 and 1979 , and is blamed for up to two million deaths .
khieu samphan has never denied these deaths , but both he and his lawyers insist that , as head of state , he was never directly responsible .
one member of his defence team is the infamous french lawyer jacques verges , whose previous clients have included nazi war criminal klaus barbie and venezuelan hijacker carlos the jackal .
mr verges , 83 , has known khieu samphan , 76 , since they were both involved in left-wing student activities in france in the 1950s .
life of poverty the defendant listened stony-faced as judge prak kimsan read out the case against him .
who were the khmer rouge ?
maoist regime that ruled cambodia from 1975-1979 founded and led by pol pot , who died in 1998 abolished religion , schools and currency in a bid to create agrarian utopia up to two million people thought to have died from starvation , overwork or execution brutal khmer rouge regime he confirmed his name , age and home town , and told the court he had lived a life of poverty after the khmer rouge regime was toppled .
" i have had no job since leaving the jungle .
-lrb- i have -rrb- only my wife , who struggles to feed me and my family , " he is reported as saying .
in its detention order , the prosecution alleged that khieu samphan " aided and abetted " the policies of the khmer rouge , which were " characterised by murder , extermination , imprisonment , persecution on political grounds and other inhumane acts " .
khieu samphan 's defence lawyers argued that he held " no real power " and was therefore not guilty of the crimes he was charged with , according to documents read out by judge prak kimsan .
the court then went into a closed-door session .
the long-delayed un-backed genocide tribunal is expected to hold its first trial later this year .
those also facing charges include nuon chea , second-in-command of the late khmer rouge leader pol pot ; the former foreign and social affairs ministers , ieng sary and ieng thirith ; and duch , who ran the notorious tuol sleng jail in phnom penh .
under the khmer rouge , more than one million people died from starvation or overwork as leaders strove to create an agrarian utopia .
hundreds of thousands of the educated middle-classes were tortured and executed in special centres .
khmer rouge founder pol pot died in 1998 , and many fear that delays to the judicial process could mean that the khmer rouge 's surviving leaders could die before being brought to justice .

the musical adaptation of the legendary 1939 movie ran to three-and-half hours despite cuts , but danesh remarked it was " still shorter than the film " .
despite a warm reception from a star-studded audience , critics called the show " dreary and unspectacular " .
danesh gave a " stilted impersonation " of clark gable , said the telegraph .
critic charles spencer said jill paice , in the role of scarlett o 'hara , was " pert , pretty and full of pep " but she lacked " the viciousness and eroticism the role also demands " .
' diabolically dashing ' paul taylor of the independent was more convinced by danesh 's performance .
he said : " the diabolically dashing darius danesh brings a seductively insolent charm , a dark velvet voice and a genuine fugitive pathos to the cynical blockade runner . "
paul callan of the daily express also heaped praise on the former pop idol contestant , saying " only his performance saves this show from crumbling into utter mediocrity " .
but trevor nunn 's show , he went on to say , was " frequently dire " .
other cast members , including yvette williams as mammy and jina burrows as prissy , were widely applauded by the critics .
danesh said after his performance : " i had a blast , it was my first opening night and it was great to cut my teeth with the inimitable trevor nunn . "

iqrit 's only remaining permanent structure is the old stone church the three-dot symbol on the map is one of hundreds of such locations throughout this historically rich land - but this is no biblical or roman-era relic .
iqrit was an arab christian village vacated during the 1948-49 war , one of hundreds of villages in the former palestine whose populations either went into exile or , as in the iqritis ' case , into internal displacement in the new israeli state .
while traces of many of these deserted villages have all but disappeared , the sparsely wooded hilltop of iqrit - against all odds - continues to play host to its former inhabitants and their children and grandchildren .
on the first saturday of every month , a priest comes to hold mass in the only permanent building left in the village , the blue-domed st mary 's church .
here iqritis get married and christen their children , and they bury dead in the little cemetery at the bottom of the hill .
on sundays and public holidays , youngsters play football on the hilltop 's only flat area , parents arrange picnics and old-timers reminisce or sit in silent thought .
hopes dashed one old man , 80-year-old asad mbada daoud , says he remembers clearly the day israeli troops captured iqrit , in october 1948 .
initially , it seemed the 450 inhabitants might remain in their homes after surrendering to the troops and pledging to live in peace under israeli rule .
asad daoud was 20 when his village surrendered to the israeli army after a week , however , they were evacuated by force to al-rama , about 12 miles -lrb- 20km -rrb- south , while the army " cleaned " the border area of arab fighters .
" it was a very hard life , " says mr daoud .
" all our food and resources were in the village , we had no work .
we lived 60 to a room in schools , or stayed in empty houses of refugees . "
assurances that they would be allowed to return after a fortnight were not honoured ; weeks of exile turned into months , years .
despite several court rulings in the inhabitants ' favour , the israeli military prevented their return citing emergency regulations .
on christmas eve in 1951 , army officers took some village elders to a nearby hill and they watched as the old stone houses were blown up with dynamite and tank fire , as many other palestinian villages had been .
burial rights already however , the iqritis ' persistence had started to become apparent , for one thing bringing their dead for burial here .
in pictures : a sunday at iqrit " we tried to bury diab sbayt here in 1949 , " says maruf ashkar , another octogenarian .
" but the police came and told us to disinter him and take him to fasuta " -lrb- a still-populated christian village nearby -rrb- .
villagers launched petitions , more court cases and parliamentary hearings , but the army remained adamant .
even pope john paul ii took up their case on his historic millennial visit to the holy land , but to no avail .
they did win the legal right to bury their dead in iqrit , but to date that has been their only concrete success .
the old men 's stories continue as we leave the shade of the high church walls and walk down rutted tracks past the piles of grey stones that were their old homes .
mr ashkar picks wild thyme from the rubble which he hopes will take root in his " temporary " home of many decades , kafr yassif .
enduring commitment we pass hana nasser , who was 10 in 1948 , sitting with his head in his hands .
" i am here on the ruins of my house , " he says .
" i come here to sit almost every sunday .
i will never forget my home . "
hana nasser says he will never abandon the home he left at the age of 10 the people of iqrit are luckier than many of their compatriots living as refugees in lebanon , syria , jordan and the occupied palestinian territories - now numbering millions - who have not laid eyes on their homes since 1948 .
israel presents vigorous arguments for rejecting the palestinian refugees ' right of return - pragmatically israel argues that it needs to remain a jewish-majority state and morally it points to the similarly large numbers of jews who fled arab countries after 1948 .
but it is hard for the former residents of iqrit and their descendants to understand why the authorities block them - full israeli citizens - from re-establishing their community in the village , unless it is to avoid setting a precedent for other absentee palestinians to return .
as israel 's diamond jubilee approaches next month - a date marked as nakba -lrb- catastrophe -rrb- by palestinians , iqrit is certainly a testament to the enduring palestinian desire to remain in touch with life pre-1948 , whatever the obstacles .
" i 'm confident i will return to my home here , " nemi ashkar , one of the younger organisers of the iqrit campaign , says with irony .
" but i want to return alive , and not just to our cemetery . "
