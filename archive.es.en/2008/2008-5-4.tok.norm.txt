even if berlin does order troops to be deployed eventually , fischer said , germany is likely to be seen as the " bad guy " who missed the opportunity to act on its own initiative . " in germany , we 've forgotten why we 're even there , " he said in the interview , which was conducted at the munk centre for international studies at the university of toronto . german opposition german public support for the six-year-old mission is slipping with a majority saying they oppose continued deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public does n't support the afghanistan mission there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .

boeing maintains that it will consume 20 percent less fuel then similar-sized planes . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the pressure was high .
we invested heavily in new players and you never know how it is going to go .

it was a very good season .

even if berlin does order troops to be deployed eventually , fischer said , germany is likely to be seen as the " bad guy " who missed the opportunity to act on its own initiative . " in germany , we 've forgotten why we 're even there , " he said in the interview , which was conducted at the munk centre for international studies at the university of toronto . german opposition german public support for the six-year-old mission is slipping with a majority saying they oppose continued deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public does n't support the afghanistan mission there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .
germany has insisted german troops are making headway in stabilizing the north . fischer , in the newspaper interview , said is needed to be made clear that the afghanistan mission is a reaction to the terrorist attacks in the us on sept .
11 , 2001 , and warned that if similar attacks could follow if the fight against the taliban and al qaeda is not successful . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was a special season because the expectations were huge and there had been great disappointment from last year , " hitzfeld told premiere tv .
" the pressure was high .
we invested heavily in new players and you never know how it is going to go . " it gives me great satisfaction that i can hand over to juergen klinsmann a super team which can again compete at the top next season . " ' a good season ' club president franz beckenbauer said : " the team deserved it , it led from the start .
it was a very good season . " the champagne had been kept on ice following last week 's results which had virtually assured bayern of the title . it was perhaps fitting that bayern were able to seal the title in wolfsburg , led by former coach magath , and where five years ago they also clinched the last title with hitzfeld . bildunterschrift : trainer ottmar hitzfeld got a beer shower but there was little sparkle in the performance from a reshuffled bayern side minus the injured goalkeeper oliver kahn , defender lucio , midfielders franck ribery and ze roberto and striker miroslav klose . bayern , routed 4-0 by zenit st petersburg in the uefa cup on thursday , were unable to raise their game against a workmanlike wolfsburg , fighting for a uefa cup place . that did nothing to spoil the celebrations , with hitzfeld among those receiving a drenching of beer . chairman karl-heinz rummenigee was also a victim when soaked by bastian schweinsteiger while giving a television interview .

even if berlin does order troops to be deployed eventually , fischer said , germany is likely to be seen as the " bad guy " who missed the opportunity to act on its own initiative . " in germany , we 've forgotten why we 're even there , " he said in the interview , which was conducted at the munk centre for international studies at the university of toronto . german opposition german public support for the six-year-old mission is slipping with a majority saying they oppose continued deployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public does n't support the afghanistan mission there are about 40,000 nato and 20,000 us-led coalition soldiers in afghanistan .
nato commanders said at the end of january they need about 7,500 more troops to carry out their mission . in january , us defense secretary robert gates reportedly sent an " unusually stern " letter to german defense minister franz josef jung demanding combat troops , helicopters and paratroopers for afghanistan and charging that some nato states were not pulling their weight .
southern afghanistan has seen the worst violence since the taliban was ousted in the us-led invasion in 2001 . but germany has rejected the call for troops in battle-ravaged southern afghanistan , insisting berlin 's focus on reconstruction efforts in the relatively calm north was justified .
germany has insisted german troops are making headway in stabilizing the north . fischer , in the newspaper interview , said is needed to be made clear that the afghanistan mission is a reaction to the terrorist attacks in the us on sept .
11 , 2001 , and warned that if similar attacks could follow if the fight against the taliban and al qaeda is not successful . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was a special season because the expectations were huge and there had been great disappointment from last year , " hitzfeld told premiere tv .
" the pressure was high .
we invested heavily in new players and you never know how it is going to go . " it gives me great satisfaction that i can hand over to juergen klinsmann a super team which can again compete at the top next season . " ' a good season ' club president franz beckenbauer said : " the team deserved it , it led from the start .
it was a very good season . " the champagne had been kept on ice following last week 's results which had virtually assured bayern of the title . it was perhaps fitting that bayern were able to seal the title in wolfsburg , led by former coach magath , and where five years ago they also clinched the last title with hitzfeld . bildunterschrift : trainer ottmar hitzfeld got a beer shower but there was little sparkle in the performance from a reshuffled bayern side minus the injured goalkeeper oliver kahn , defender lucio , midfielders franck ribery and ze roberto and striker miroslav klose . bayern , routed 4-0 by zenit st petersburg in the uefa cup on thursday , were unable to raise their game against a workmanlike wolfsburg , fighting for a uefa cup place . that did nothing to spoil the celebrations , with hitzfeld among those receiving a drenching of beer . chairman karl-heinz rummenigee was also a victim when soaked by bastian schweinsteiger while giving a television interview .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : microsoft ends yahoo bid british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:48 gmt , sunday , 4 may 2008 08:48 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : microsoft ends yahoo bid the software giant , microsoft , has withdrawn its offer for internet services company yahoo after the two failed to agree on a price .
the merger of the two companies was designed to tackle a common rival , internet search giant google .
now microsoft says it will go it alone and take on google all by itself .
why did microsoft and yahoo fail to reach an agreement ?
it simply came down to money .
yahoo 's bosses argued that microsoft undervalued their company - even though the offer was raised twice in secret negotiations .
microsoft had originally offered a 62 % premium on yahoo 's share price , based on the day the merger proposal was made .
in the end this bid was improved to a 70 % premium .
that still was n't enough for yahoo 's board and management , who argued that their company was on the road to recovery .
there is a suspicion that yahoo 's bosses simply did n't want to do a deal on principle .
there has never been any love lost between the two companies .
demanding a very high price for yahoo may have been a convenient way of not making the deal happen .
microsoft chief executive steve ballmer , for his part , told his employees on friday that he " knew exactly " what yahoo was worth and that he would not pay " a dime above " .
what next ?
i thought microsoft had threatened a hostile takeover if talks failed ?
yes , that was the original game plan .
microsoft had warned that it might first lower its offer and then nominate its own candidates to be elected to yahoo 's board at the annual general meeting this summer .
then it would have been up to yahoo 's shareholders to decide whether they wanted a microsoft-friendly board in place .
mr ballmer now says that this option is " not sensible " , because the long fight would allow yahoo 's bosses to " take steps that would make yahoo undesirable as an acquisition in the first place " .
why did they want to get together in the first place ?
i have three words for you : google , google , google .
when the internet was young , yahoo was its 800 pound gorilla , and microsoft - after a false start - managed to acquire silverback status on the web as well .
google has changed all that .
not even 10 years old - the birthday candles will be blown this september - google is the one company that has cracked the secret of how to make big bucks on the internet .
its search engine rules supreme - achieving a market share of more than 80 % in regions like europe .
and its search advertising business has turned out to be the world 's largest internet goldmine .
as google spreads the reach of its business , it seriously undermines yahoo 's and microsoft 's sources of internet revenue .
its moves into the field of on-demand software , meanwhile , pose a fundamental threat to microsoft .
we will probably never know whether a combination of yahoo and microsoft would have created a formidable challenge to google .
but microsoft 's bosses clearly believed that a combination of the two could have done the trick .
what now for yahoo ?
oh dear , poor yahoo .
if you are a yahoo shareholder , then brace yourself to lose quite a hefty chunk of your investment when us stock markets open on monday .
if you work for yahoo and have stock options , you will be smarting as well .
and if you work for yahoo 's legal team , you may want to get ready for a deluge of lawsuits from enraged shareholders , who have seen a 70 % boost to their investment evaporate .
there are not many companies in the world who can both afford to buy yahoo and possibly get the approval of competition watchdogs to do so .
yahoo 's top managers , however , will try to fight back , striking a series of alliances - including with google , especially on advertising - to find new revenue streams .
and what about microsoft ?
microsoft dearly wants to catch up with google , and fast .
mr ballmer has now told staff that this is still its ambition .
together with yahoo this could have been achieved faster , he says , but he also believes that the world 's richest technology company can do it alone - albeit at a somewhat slower pace .
some of microsoft 's shareholders , though , will breathe a sigh of relief .
not everybody believed that " microhoo " would have been a success .
without the albatross yahoo around its neck , microsoft 's share price should soar .

the merger of the two companies was designed to tackle a common rival , internet search giant google .
now microsoft says it will go it alone and take on google all by itself .
why did microsoft and yahoo fail to reach an agreement ?
it simply came down to money .
yahoo 's bosses argued that microsoft undervalued their company - even though the offer was raised twice in secret negotiations .
microsoft had originally offered a 62 % premium on yahoo 's share price , based on the day the merger proposal was made .
in the end this bid was improved to a 70 % premium .
that still was n't enough for yahoo 's board and management , who argued that their company was on the road to recovery .
there is a suspicion that yahoo 's bosses simply did n't want to do a deal on principle .
there has never been any love lost between the two companies .
demanding a very high price for yahoo may have been a convenient way of not making the deal happen .
microsoft chief executive steve ballmer , for his part , told his employees on friday that he " knew exactly " what yahoo was worth and that he would not pay " a dime above " .
what next ?
i thought microsoft had threatened a hostile takeover if talks failed ?
yes , that was the original game plan .
microsoft had warned that it might first lower its offer and then nominate its own candidates to be elected to yahoo 's board at the annual general meeting this summer .
then it would have been up to yahoo 's shareholders to decide whether they wanted a microsoft-friendly board in place .
mr ballmer now says that this option is " not sensible " , because the long fight would allow yahoo 's bosses to " take steps that would make yahoo undesirable as an acquisition in the first place " .
why did they want to get together in the first place ?
i have three words for you : google , google , google .
when the internet was young , yahoo was its 800 pound gorilla , and microsoft - after a false start - managed to acquire silverback status on the web as well .
google has changed all that .
not even 10 years old - the birthday candles will be blown this september - google is the one company that has cracked the secret of how to make big bucks on the internet .
its search engine rules supreme - achieving a market share of more than 80 % in regions like europe .
and its search advertising business has turned out to be the world 's largest internet goldmine .
as google spreads the reach of its business , it seriously undermines yahoo 's and microsoft 's sources of internet revenue .
its moves into the field of on-demand software , meanwhile , pose a fundamental threat to microsoft .
we will probably never know whether a combination of yahoo and microsoft would have created a formidable challenge to google .
but microsoft 's bosses clearly believed that a combination of the two could have done the trick .
what now for yahoo ?
oh dear , poor yahoo .
if you are a yahoo shareholder , then brace yourself to lose quite a hefty chunk of your investment when us stock markets open on monday .
if you work for yahoo and have stock options , you will be smarting as well .
and if you work for yahoo 's legal team , you may want to get ready for a deluge of lawsuits from enraged shareholders , who have seen a 70 % boost to their investment evaporate .
there are not many companies in the world who can both afford to buy yahoo and possibly get the approval of competition watchdogs to do so .
yahoo 's top managers , however , will try to fight back , striking a series of alliances - including with google , especially on advertising - to find new revenue streams .
and what about microsoft ?
microsoft dearly wants to catch up with google , and fast .
mr ballmer has now told staff that this is still its ambition .
together with yahoo this could have been achieved faster , he says , but he also believes that the world 's richest technology company can do it alone - albeit at a somewhat slower pace .
some of microsoft 's shareholders , though , will breathe a sigh of relief .
not everybody believed that " microhoo " would have been a success .
without the albatross yahoo around its neck , microsoft 's share price should soar .

on the face of it , both companies are .
after all , who can tackle the google behemoth bestriding the world wide web ?
however , that assumes that the combination of microsoft 's and yahoo 's dna would have created a top athlete , not a corporate frankenstein .
microsoft chief executive steve ballmer may beg to differ , but it was far from certain that the combination of two not-quite-that-successful teams of web engineers would have resulted in a credible challenger for google .
take yahoo 's most recent technical failure , called panama .
this advertising platform was supposed to match up search results with appropriate advertising .
" there 's nothing in panama that i would want to integrate with our offering , " a senior microsoft executive told me last week .
buying eyeballs ultimately , microsoft 's bid for yahoo was probably not about technology , but eyeballs - the term used by advertising executives to describe a website 's number of users .
despite all its troubles , yahoo still commands a lead in the all-important us web market , and it has a healthy market share in many countries around the world .
as microsoft had difficulties growing its global web reach organically , buying eyeballs - or market share - through the acquisition of yahoo was the obvious solution .
now mr ballmer has to come up with a plan b. connecting the dots once again , the solution comes from the department of the bleeding obvious , but is worth repeating nonetheless .
microsoft is big on the web because it can shepherd audiences straight from its windows operating system to its internet explorer browser , its live messenger and all its web properties .
the problem is that microsoft 's web offering has always been less than compelling .
and as a result microsoft has been fraying at the edges , losing both users and revenue to the likes of google . "
at yahoo , champagne corks will be popping as it has escaped the clutches of microsoft " in the long-term these losses are not sustainable for microsoft , especially as web-based applications are getting better and command ever more eyeballs .
to staunch the haemorrhaging of users , microsoft has to make its web offering not only more compelling , but much more integrated .
google for its part has managed to link up its disparate suite of web tools in a nicely integrated offering .
getting from gmail to google docs to google maps to google search to google reader or even google earth requires just a click or two .
now microsoft has to do the same .
one microsoft executive calls its " connecting our own dots " .
already microsoft 's " live " offering of search , maps and other tools is beginning to resemble and in some ways - for example video search - even excels the google proposition .
it is still done in a very old-school microsoft way , and creaking and jarring in many places .
travelling the microsoft live universe gives users a feel for the rivalries between the many competing teams within microsoft .
buying in expertise but instead of waiting for another big deal like buying yahoo , expect to see microsoft going on a buying spree for many small web 2.0 companies .
this would not be a sign of weakness .
remember , some of google 's best offerings are the fruit of such small acquisitions .
microsoft founder bill gates will end his day-to-day involvement with the company this summer .
the firm 's new leadership will have to prove that it can deliver a web offering that is integrated , profitable , and can ultimately substitute the profits generated by microsoft 's top two cash cows windows and office .
after all , what is it that google 's clever engineers can do that microsoft 's equally clever engineers ca n't ?
maybe it has something to do with the corporate mindset - and the lack of focus in microsoft 's sprawling empire .
yahoo !
at yahoo meanwhile , champagne corks will be popping as it has escaped the clutches of microsoft .
the next day , though , will see yahoo wake up with an almighty hangover .
yahoo founder jerry yang promised shareholders and staff that " with the distraction of microsoft 's unsolicited proposal now behind us , we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history " .
fat chance of that .
mr yang and his top managers will be mightily distracted by the need to chase revenue-generating deals with the likes of google and aol .
even more worryingly , they have to brace themselves for a deluge of lawsuits from angry shareholders who have lost out big time .
and if yahoo 's techies were worried about falling under the leaden grip of microsoft management , they will soon have to swallow even harder when their solutions are discarded to make way for the tried and tested offering from google .
already yahoo has run tests to replace its paid search system with that from google .
yahoo likes to write its name with an exclamation mark at the end - " yahoo ! " .
this might be the right time to update the branding : how about " yahoo ? " .

after all , who can tackle the google behemoth bestriding the world wide web ?
steve ballmer and jerry yang both face the google challenge however , that assumes that the combination of microsoft 's and yahoo 's dna would have created a top athlete , not a corporate frankenstein .
microsoft chief executive steve ballmer may beg to differ , but it was far from certain that the combination of two not-quite-that-successful teams of web engineers would have resulted in a credible challenger for google .
take yahoo 's most recent technical failure , called panama .
this advertising platform was supposed to match up search results with appropriate advertising .
" there 's nothing in panama that i would want to integrate with our offering , " a senior microsoft executive told me last week .
buying eyeballs ultimately , microsoft 's bid for yahoo was probably not about technology , but eyeballs - the term used by advertising executives to describe a website 's number of users .
despite all its troubles , yahoo still commands a lead in the all-important us web market , and it has a healthy market share in many countries around the world .
as microsoft had difficulties growing its global web reach organically , buying eyeballs - or market share - through the acquisition of yahoo was the obvious solution .
now mr ballmer has to come up with a plan b. connecting the dots once again , the solution comes from the department of the bleeding obvious , but is worth repeating nonetheless .
microsoft is big on the web because it can shepherd audiences straight from its windows operating system to its internet explorer browser , its live messenger and all its web properties .
the problem is that microsoft 's web offering has always been less than compelling .
and as a result microsoft has been fraying at the edges , losing both users and revenue to the likes of google .
at yahoo , champagne corks will be popping as it has escaped the clutches of microsoft in the long-term these losses are not sustainable for microsoft , especially as web-based applications are getting better and command ever more eyeballs .
to staunch the haemorrhaging of users , microsoft has to make its web offering not only more compelling , but much more integrated .
google for its part has managed to link up its disparate suite of web tools in a nicely integrated offering .
getting from gmail to google docs to google maps to google search to google reader or even google earth requires just a click or two .
now microsoft has to do the same .
one microsoft executive calls its " connecting our own dots " .
already microsoft 's " live " offering of search , maps and other tools is beginning to resemble and in some ways - for example video search - even excels the google proposition .
it is still done in a very old-school microsoft way , and creaking and jarring in many places .
travelling the microsoft live universe gives users a feel for the rivalries between the many competing teams within microsoft .
buying in expertise but instead of waiting for another big deal like buying yahoo , expect to see microsoft going on a buying spree for many small web 2.0 companies .
this would not be a sign of weakness .
remember , some of google 's best offerings are the fruit of such small acquisitions .

chris fountain and emma rigby won best actor and actress for the channel 4 programme , with other wins including best on-screen partnership .
but eastenders won four prizes , including best soap , with coronation street taking a total of five awards .
liz dawn , who played vera duckworth until her exit earlier this year , was given the lifetime achievement award .
accepting her honour , she said : " i wish i was young again , i could do it all over again .
it 's only when you leave that you realise what a lovely life you 've had .
it 's been fantastic . "
maggie jones , another of the itv soap 's veteran actresses , won best comedy performance for her portrayal of blanche hunt .
the eastenders cast celebrated their victory in the best soap category michelle keegan , who recently arrived as tina mcintyre in the show , was named best newcomer , while rob james collier , who plays liam connor , scooped sexiest male for the second successive year .
eastenders ' slow-burning storyline about max branning and stacey slater 's affair scooped best storyline , with best dramatic performance for jo joyner , the actress who plays max 's wife tanya .
another albert square winner was actor jamie borthwick -lrb- jay brown -rrb- , who won best dramatic performance from a young actor or actress .
eastenders actress barbara windsor , who plays peggy mitchell , said : " we actually came third in the number of awards and we 're going to have to up our game .
hollyoaks is coming up and we will have to do better next year . "
hollyoaks ' other awards included most spectacular scene of the year and best exit for clare cunningham , played by gemma bissix .
the actress has since rejoined eastenders as clare tyler , a role she first played from 1993 to 1998 .
liz dawn played vera duckworth for 34 years roxanne mckee , who plays louise kennedy in the channel 4 show and was named sexiest female , said the show was finally getting the recognition it deserved .
" this year we have tackled anorexia , incest and i have been in a murder case , " she said .
" we tackle those issues in a 6.30pm slot which is very hard for the writers who do a brilliant job . "
emmerdale won two awards , including best single episode , which dealt with the sudden death of ashley and laurel 's baby son daniel .
bbc one 's doctors , the other soap eligible for the awards , failed to win any prizes .
the ceremony was held at bbc television centre in west london , and the winners were determined by a mixture of panel and viewer voting .
the british soap awards will be broadcast on itv1 on wednesday at 2000 bst .
