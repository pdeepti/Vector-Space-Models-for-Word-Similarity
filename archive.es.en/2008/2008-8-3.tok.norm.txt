a photo of the athlete is allowed , but not taken in an olympic area .
that was unheard of in 1992 in barcelona , where the opening ceremony almost ended in scandal when american stars brought mobile phones along and relayed their impressions live to their home country .
it was a blatant violation of olympic rules but then ioc boss juan antonio samarach issued a reprimand instead of kicking the athletes out which would have been possible as well .
but nowadays the ioc must acknowledge that an increasing number of people use modern communications techniques which include blogs .
special rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the olympic games is a huge media event once several athletes had their blog in turin 2006 , the ioc executive board drew up rules to officially allow athletes their blogs while at the same time preserving the rights of the accredited media and the ioc sponsors who were paying big money to be part of the games .
" the ioc considers blogging as a legitimate form of personal expression and not as a form of journalism , " the rules say .
" without limiting the generality of the foregoing , blogs ... should take the form of a diary or journal and , in any event , should not contain any interviews with , or stories about , other accredited persons . "
furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "
blogging falls under the rules from eight days before the games until three days after the closing ceremony .
the ioc guidelines only apply for the beijing games and not future olympics .
speaking up about issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge within the guidelines given , blogs could be one way for athletes to speak freely about sensitive issues such as human rights in china .
international olympic committee president jacques rogge did not explicitly mention the blogs , but did reiterate on saturday that athletes were able to speak freely in beijing within the rules of the olympic charter .
" the athletes have the right to freely express themselves , " rogge said .
" if they want to criticise china they can do it at home or in china in a public place . "
the charter prohibits demonstrations of a political , religious or racial nature in all olympic areas including the athletes ' village .
" the reason is that in the olympic village there are 205 national olympic committees .
the olympic village is a microcosm of the world . " dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 03.08.2008 berlin 's latest museum draws surrealists-loving crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scharf-gerstenberg collection is the 147th museum to open in art-loving berlin some 120 years ago , otto gerstenberg , the founding president of the german victoria insurance company , began assembling a fabulous art collection in berlin .
his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .
merklinger said she felt that she succeeded in brazil and had a responsible position with good pay .
she also loved the brazilian way of life and the warm climate . new start in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv shows like " goodbye deutschland " show germans seeking a new life abroad " i came back to germany out of love for my boyfriend and future husband , " the 39-year-old said . although she is happy to be back in germany and closer to her boyfriend , merklinger said that re-starting her career has not been easy . " i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 03.08.2008 beijing faces big challenge in keeping olympics drug-free großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will frequent testing do the trick and stop drug cheats from beating the system ?
china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .

" i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 03.08.2008 berlin 's latest museum draws surrealists-loving crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scharf-gerstenberg collection is the 147th museum to open in art-loving berlin some 120 years ago , otto gerstenberg , the founding president of the german victoria insurance company , began assembling a fabulous art collection in berlin .
his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 03.08.2008 aids cure less than a decade away , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger says a lot of progress is being made in fighting hiv as the 17th annual aids conference opens in mexico city on sunday , aug .
3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .

in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .

berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 03.08.2008 aids cure less than a decade away , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger says a lot of progress is being made in fighting hiv as the 17th annual aids conference opens in mexico city on sunday , aug .
3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column .

no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .

" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?

" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "

nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .

this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 03.08.2008 berlin 's latest museum draws surrealists-loving crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scharf-gerstenberg collection is the 147th museum to open in art-loving berlin some 120 years ago , otto gerstenberg , the founding president of the german victoria insurance company , began assembling a fabulous art collection in berlin .
his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking at the camp in poland on aug .
2 - the international day of commemoration for the sinti and roma victims of the nazi holocaust - rose accused sections of the italian media and certain politicians of trying to " condemn and criminalise the minority across the board . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a photo of the athlete is allowed , but not taken in an olympic area .
that was unheard of in 1992 in barcelona , where the opening ceremony almost ended in scandal when american stars brought mobile phones along and relayed their impressions live to their home country .
it was a blatant violation of olympic rules but then ioc boss juan antonio samarach issued a reprimand instead of kicking the athletes out which would have been possible as well .
but nowadays the ioc must acknowledge that an increasing number of people use modern communications techniques which include blogs .
special rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the olympic games is a huge media event once several athletes had their blog in turin 2006 , the ioc executive board drew up rules to officially allow athletes their blogs while at the same time preserving the rights of the accredited media and the ioc sponsors who were paying big money to be part of the games .
" the ioc considers blogging as a legitimate form of personal expression and not as a form of journalism , " the rules say .
" without limiting the generality of the foregoing , blogs ... should take the form of a diary or journal and , in any event , should not contain any interviews with , or stories about , other accredited persons . "
furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "
blogging falls under the rules from eight days before the games until three days after the closing ceremony .
the ioc guidelines only apply for the beijing games and not future olympics .
speaking up about issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge within the guidelines given , blogs could be one way for athletes to speak freely about sensitive issues such as human rights in china .
international olympic committee president jacques rogge did not explicitly mention the blogs , but did reiterate on saturday that athletes were able to speak freely in beijing within the rules of the olympic charter .
" the athletes have the right to freely express themselves , " rogge said .
" if they want to criticise china they can do it at home or in china in a public place . "
the charter prohibits demonstrations of a political , religious or racial nature in all olympic areas including the athletes ' village .

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .

" i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 03.08.2008 beijing faces big challenge in keeping olympics drug-free großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will frequent testing do the trick and stop drug cheats from beating the system ?
china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .
as a commercial art sales location " berlin still has a bit of catching up to do , " notes tammen . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 03.08.2008 aids cure less than a decade away , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger says a lot of progress is being made in fighting hiv as the 17th annual aids conference opens in mexico city on sunday , aug .
3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .

in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .

a photo of the athlete is allowed , but not taken in an olympic area .
that was unheard of in 1992 in barcelona , where the opening ceremony almost ended in scandal when american stars brought mobile phones along and relayed their impressions live to their home country .
it was a blatant violation of olympic rules but then ioc boss juan antonio samarach issued a reprimand instead of kicking the athletes out which would have been possible as well .
but nowadays the ioc must acknowledge that an increasing number of people use modern communications techniques which include blogs .
special rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the olympic games is a huge media event once several athletes had their blog in turin 2006 , the ioc executive board drew up rules to officially allow athletes their blogs while at the same time preserving the rights of the accredited media and the ioc sponsors who were paying big money to be part of the games .
" the ioc considers blogging as a legitimate form of personal expression and not as a form of journalism , " the rules say .
" without limiting the generality of the foregoing , blogs ... should take the form of a diary or journal and , in any event , should not contain any interviews with , or stories about , other accredited persons . "
furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "
blogging falls under the rules from eight days before the games until three days after the closing ceremony .
the ioc guidelines only apply for the beijing games and not future olympics .
speaking up about issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge within the guidelines given , blogs could be one way for athletes to speak freely about sensitive issues such as human rights in china .
international olympic committee president jacques rogge did not explicitly mention the blogs , but did reiterate on saturday that athletes were able to speak freely in beijing within the rules of the olympic charter .
" the athletes have the right to freely express themselves , " rogge said .
" if they want to criticise china they can do it at home or in china in a public place . "
the charter prohibits demonstrations of a political , religious or racial nature in all olympic areas including the athletes ' village .
" the reason is that in the olympic village there are 205 national olympic committees .

a photo of the athlete is allowed , but not taken in an olympic area .
that was unheard of in 1992 in barcelona , where the opening ceremony almost ended in scandal when american stars brought mobile phones along and relayed their impressions live to their home country .
it was a blatant violation of olympic rules but then ioc boss juan antonio samarach issued a reprimand instead of kicking the athletes out which would have been possible as well .
but nowadays the ioc must acknowledge that an increasing number of people use modern communications techniques which include blogs .
special rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the olympic games is a huge media event once several athletes had their blog in turin 2006 , the ioc executive board drew up rules to officially allow athletes their blogs while at the same time preserving the rights of the accredited media and the ioc sponsors who were paying big money to be part of the games .
" the ioc considers blogging as a legitimate form of personal expression and not as a form of journalism , " the rules say .
" without limiting the generality of the foregoing , blogs ... should take the form of a diary or journal and , in any event , should not contain any interviews with , or stories about , other accredited persons . "
furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "
blogging falls under the rules from eight days before the games until three days after the closing ceremony .
the ioc guidelines only apply for the beijing games and not future olympics .
speaking up about issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge within the guidelines given , blogs could be one way for athletes to speak freely about sensitive issues such as human rights in china .
international olympic committee president jacques rogge did not explicitly mention the blogs , but did reiterate on saturday that athletes were able to speak freely in beijing within the rules of the olympic charter .
" the athletes have the right to freely express themselves , " rogge said .
" if they want to criticise china they can do it at home or in china in a public place . "
the charter prohibits demonstrations of a political , religious or racial nature in all olympic areas including the athletes ' village .
" the reason is that in the olympic village there are 205 national olympic committees .
the olympic village is a microcosm of the world . " dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .

" i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 03.08.2008 aids cure less than a decade away , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger says a lot of progress is being made in fighting hiv as the 17th annual aids conference opens in mexico city on sunday , aug .
3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .
merklinger said she felt that she succeeded in brazil and had a responsible position with good pay .
she also loved the brazilian way of life and the warm climate . new start in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv shows like " goodbye deutschland " show germans seeking a new life abroad " i came back to germany out of love for my boyfriend and future husband , " the 39-year-old said . although she is happy to be back in germany and closer to her boyfriend , merklinger said that re-starting her career has not been easy . " i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .
" when people come back , then they 've learned something that they can introduce here in germany . " vogt also does n't know if he wants to stay in australia forever .

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .

the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .

she also loved the brazilian way of life and the warm climate . new start in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv shows like " goodbye deutschland " show germans seeking a new life abroad " i came back to germany out of love for my boyfriend and future husband , " the 39-year-old said . although she is happy to be back in germany and closer to her boyfriend , merklinger said that re-starting her career has not been easy . " i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

speaking at the camp in poland on aug .
2 - the international day of commemoration for the sinti and roma victims of the nazi holocaust - rose accused sections of the italian media and certain politicians of trying to " condemn and criminalise the minority across the board . "
instead of holding conferences and issuing statements , the eu should introduce effective measures to protect the sinti and roma , known pejoratively as gypsies , rose said .
he demanded steps to do away with the " completely unacceptable " living conditions of the minority in much of the eu .

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .
" but we 're not naïve , we know there are drugs that ca n't be detected . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 03.08.2008 aids cure less than a decade away , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger says a lot of progress is being made in fighting hiv as the 17th annual aids conference opens in mexico city on sunday , aug .
3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .

we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 03.08.2008 aids cure less than a decade away , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaeger says a lot of progress is being made in fighting hiv as the 17th annual aids conference opens in mexico city on sunday , aug .
3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a photo of the athlete is allowed , but not taken in an olympic area .
that was unheard of in 1992 in barcelona , where the opening ceremony almost ended in scandal when american stars brought mobile phones along and relayed their impressions live to their home country .

furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .
merklinger said she felt that she succeeded in brazil and had a responsible position with good pay .
she also loved the brazilian way of life and the warm climate . new start in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv shows like " goodbye deutschland " show germans seeking a new life abroad " i came back to germany out of love for my boyfriend and future husband , " the 39-year-old said . although she is happy to be back in germany and closer to her boyfriend , merklinger said that re-starting her career has not been easy . " i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .
" when people come back , then they 've learned something that they can introduce here in germany . " vogt also does n't know if he wants to stay in australia forever .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

china is seeking to avoid a repeat of the drugs scandals that have become a regular feature of sports competitions when the beijing olympics open on aug .
8 .
but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "
more and better tests the answer ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the race is on between those use drugs and those who try to stamp them out the international olympic committee has already said it plans to collect 4,500 blood and urine samples before and during two weeks of athletic events at this year 's olympic games - a 25 percent increase from the 2004 athens games .
nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .
for instance , now the test for the growth hormone is ready , " said spitz , adding that it would be used in beijing .
" that way you further limit the number of substances , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one ngo is going further : it 's in the process of constructing europe 's greenest building . on the shores of lake geneva , ground is being broken - for a ground-breaking building .
the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- is building its new headquarters on the shores of lake geneva in western switzerland . “ our aim is to show the swiss building industry and perhaps the whole european building industry that you can build with less money , but in a sustainable way , and that it doesn ’ t cost more than a normal building - perhaps even less , ” said the iucn 's chief administrator merja murdoch , who is overseeing the construction project . environmental soundness is taken into consideration , even in the smaller details - like with the use of recycled cement and special technology that circulates the air in each office space , said alison rowles , iucn ’ s director of global operations .
recycled office chairs are also in the works . the new headquarters , to be completed by the end of next year , will be completely energy-efficient , too , explained murdoch . “ energy will be created by the geothermal heat that we get from the ground , " she said , " and photovoltaic panels on the roof will create the electricity we use for lighting and for our computers . " if we produce more than we need , the rest will go into the rig , ” she added . out to win the prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the office chairs inside will be recycled the iucn is aiming for official recognition for its efforts - what ’ s known as platinum approval from the united states ' green building council , the highest of the group 's four certification levels . " if you really have a committed plan , which we do , and you have a committed design-team , which we do , it is very doable within the project requirements -lrb- to achieve platinum -rrb- , but it is not easy , ” said michael holz , a consultant architect on the iucn project . iucn also has plans for the area surrounding its new headquarters .
what 's now just a huge mountain of earth next to the construction site will soon be made into a meadow , which should offer more than just a nice view for employees . " the idea is that some very rare species of irises might take up here , " said murdoch .
" we hope so . ” as far as the view goes , workers also have lake geneva and the alps just outside their windows , which will be equipped with a sun-shading system that allows them to control how much light comes in while still enjoying the view . imogen foulkes -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a photo of the athlete is allowed , but not taken in an olympic area .
that was unheard of in 1992 in barcelona , where the opening ceremony almost ended in scandal when american stars brought mobile phones along and relayed their impressions live to their home country .
it was a blatant violation of olympic rules but then ioc boss juan antonio samarach issued a reprimand instead of kicking the athletes out which would have been possible as well .
but nowadays the ioc must acknowledge that an increasing number of people use modern communications techniques which include blogs .
special rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony of the olympic games is a huge media event once several athletes had their blog in turin 2006 , the ioc executive board drew up rules to officially allow athletes their blogs while at the same time preserving the rights of the accredited media and the ioc sponsors who were paying big money to be part of the games .
" the ioc considers blogging as a legitimate form of personal expression and not as a form of journalism , " the rules say .
" without limiting the generality of the foregoing , blogs ... should take the form of a diary or journal and , in any event , should not contain any interviews with , or stories about , other accredited persons . "
furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "
blogging falls under the rules from eight days before the games until three days after the closing ceremony .
the ioc guidelines only apply for the beijing games and not future olympics .
speaking up about issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioc president jacques rogge within the guidelines given , blogs could be one way for athletes to speak freely about sensitive issues such as human rights in china .
international olympic committee president jacques rogge did not explicitly mention the blogs , but did reiterate on saturday that athletes were able to speak freely in beijing within the rules of the olympic charter .
" the athletes have the right to freely express themselves , " rogge said .
" if they want to criticise china they can do it at home or in china in a public place . "
the charter prohibits demonstrations of a political , religious or racial nature in all olympic areas including the athletes ' village .
" the reason is that in the olympic village there are 205 national olympic committees .

and they are sick of germany .
more and more are leaving the country to try their luck abroad , and they often find that coming back is not always easy . christian vogt wants out of germany as soon as possible . " i 've had it up to here , " he said with his hand next to his chin .
the 37-year-old architect has been working full time for six years .
he has a good job at an architectural firm , but that hasn ’ t stopped him from wanting to leave . vogt speaks of feeling exploited , of enduring bad working conditions for too little money with a lot of overtime . life 's better down under ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sydney is a popular destination at the end of the year , vogt plans to move to australia , a country he has never visited .
but he knows that architects there are highly sought after .
the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .

" i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 03.08.2008 berlin 's latest museum draws surrealists-loving crowds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scharf-gerstenberg collection is the 147th museum to open in art-loving berlin some 120 years ago , otto gerstenberg , the founding president of the german victoria insurance company , began assembling a fabulous art collection in berlin .
his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .
as a commercial art sales location " berlin still has a bit of catching up to do , " notes tammen . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .

berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .

the australian government put his occupation on a list of those most urgently needed to fill the labor shortage down under . many educated germans are doing the same thing as voigt .
the country 's statistics office estimates that more than 160,000 people emigrated last year , a level that has n't been topped since 1954 . the majority of these people are young and well-educated .
this exodus is taking place at the same time that german employers have been complaining about the shortage of skilled employees . moving seen as giving a career boost germany 's ministry of economics and technology recently asked germans about their reasons for leaving the country .
most emigrants pointed to better career options and higher pay abroad .
some also mentioned high taxes and germany 's bureaucracy as playing a role .
a desire for adventure was another likely factor . " for some jobs , the possibilities abroad are actually very good , " said manuel wagner from the catholic organization raphaels-werk , who advises people interested in emigrating . " doctors , for example , are in demand almost everywhere , " he added . raphaels-werk is a relief agency , affiliated with the catholic aid charity caritas and the german bishop 's conference , which assist emigrants .
more than 20 outreach offices in germany deal with both those who want to leave the country and those returning home . " do n't burn your bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are a lot of reasons why people come back vogt recently went to cologne to meet with manuel wagner of raphaels-werk .
the meeting cost 25 euros -lrb- $ 39 -rrb- . " above all , i wanted practical tips on entry regulations and the validity of my degrees , " vogt said . wagner asked vogt what he hoped to gain from emigrating . " i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .
martina merklinger worked for nearly four years as an art historian at a research institute in sao paulo , brazil .
she 's now sitting in her new apartment in stuttgart unpacking boxes . " i could have seen myself staying in brazil a lot longer , " the dark-haired woman said . she initially went to brazil as part of a research grant and from that got a job offer .
merklinger said she felt that she succeeded in brazil and had a responsible position with good pay .
she also loved the brazilian way of life and the warm climate . new start in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tv shows like " goodbye deutschland " show germans seeking a new life abroad " i came back to germany out of love for my boyfriend and future husband , " the 39-year-old said . although she is happy to be back in germany and closer to her boyfriend , merklinger said that re-starting her career has not been easy . " i do not have the impression that my education and language knowledge and my foreign experience are very welcome in germany , " she said . she has sent out more than 30 job applications but has n't found work .
now she 's upset with the federal employment office , feeling that they are uninterested in helping her . " i feel like there should be a central place for repatriates where it 's possible to get information and maybe financial help to start , " she said . homesick for germany ? currently , merklinger is living off her savings and her boyfriend is supporting her as well .
she is n't entitled to employee benefits since she did n't make social security contributions . even so , she does not regret her time abroad . " i can only suggest that everyone have this experience , " she said .
" when people come back , then they 've learned something that they can introduce here in germany . " vogt also does n't know if he wants to stay in australia forever . " first , i want to test the australian job market , " he said . monika dittrich -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .

but how clean will the event be ? " zero tolerance for doping " is the official slogan of the olympic games in beijing .
but that has n't stopped anti-doping experts from expressing serious doubts about an effective crackdown on drug cheats , particularly in disciplines such as track and field , cycling , swimming and weightlifting .
ulrike spitz , spokeswoman for germany 's national anti-doping agency nada , pointed out that the last olympic games in athens were also hit by doping scandals .
" i think these olympic games will be pretty normal , " spitz said , adding however she was confident that the drug tests in beijing would work correctly .
" but it 's simply really difficult to say what 's going on in this huge chinese market , " spitz said .
gene doping and copycat drugs persistent rumors about a huge doping racket in china fuelled by the country 's ambitions of greater sporting glory were partly confirmed last week by an explosive new documentary broadcast on german television station ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china allegedly produces copycat versions of blood-booster epo which are often undetectable the film , shot by a german reporter with a hidden camera , shows a chinese doctor offering stem-cell therapy to athletes .
although chinese officials have offered evidence in recent months that they are cracking down on doping before the beijing olympics , the tv documentary suggests china is still a major center for the production and distribution of performance-enhancing drugs .
earlier in july , the bbc reported had seen evidence that laboratories in china were classing positive tests for the blood-boosting drug epo as negatives .
the investigation also found that copycat versions of the epo drug are available on the internet for as little as $ 50 and according to experts , often undetectable .
and in june this year , two of china 's athletes , a swimmer and a freestyle wrestler , were banned for life for doping offences dealing an embarrassing blow to the host nation in the run-up to the games .
clean competitions a farce ?
despite mounting evidence of illegal drug use in sports , chinese officials point out that they have done much to clamp down on doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are those biceps for real ?
" chinese sports authorities have done a lot within the framework of the anti-doping campaign , " said sun weide , press spokesman for the chinese olympic organizing committee , who pointed out that beijing passed an anti-doping law in 2004 .
" i think we have the means to deal with this problem . "
that problem is by no means confined to china .
this week alone , five female members of russia 's olympic team were suspended by the international governing body for track and field and a jamaican sprinter was dropped from his team after testing positive for a muscle-building veterinary drug .
last month , bulgaria withdrew its entire weightlifting team after 11 athletes tested positive for steroids , and 11 greek weightlifters were suspended for doping .
professional sport without doping is hardly imaginable any more .
" i never speak of clean competitions , " nada 's spitz said .
" there 's never a guarantee that sports events are clean .
you 'll always have athletes who will try to cheat .
it 's extremely important that detection techniques become better to ensure that the rules are upheld . "

nada , which is responsible for testing the german squad of 450 athletes at the olympics , is also increasing the number of tests this year to 9000 instead of the 4,800 checks it carried out in 2007 .
" every german athlete traveling to beijing will be tested at least once , " spitz said , adding the tests varied according to the sport .
" there are sport disciplines that are more risky than others , we naturally have to take that into account , " she said .
the hope is that frequent testing and more sophisticated detection techniques will keep the games comparatively free of drug-cheating .
" there 's simply much more money being pumped into drug research than before .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan exiles in nepal protest against the chinese government " i would like to encourage the athletes , men and women , to look at things as they are , and not to turn away , " he wrote in a column . " each athlete can , in their own way , give a signal .
no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .
" it is our duty not to forget the people of tibet , who are fighting for their cultural survival , " poettering said .
poettering criticized the pace of talks between beijing and the dalai lama 's representatives and highlighted the tibetan spiritual leader 's planned appearance at the parliament in strasbourg on december 4 .
the olympic games , which start on friday and run through until august 24 , are being seen by many world leaders as an opportunity to pressure china into rights concessions , particularly with regard to tibet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i often see people who have problems and believe that in a foreign country everything would automatically become better , " wagner said .
" in these cases i advise against emigrating . " no matter how good the prospects look for work abroad , wagner always suggests keeping open the possibility of returning to germany . " one should not close all of the doors in one 's home country , " wagner said .
" in a foreign country , a lot can go wrong . " obstacles to returning even when nothing goes wrong , coming back is n't always easy .

furthermore , the rules require olympic blogs to be " dignified and in good taste " and to conform to the " olympic spirit . "
blogging falls under the rules from eight days before the games until three days after the closing ceremony .
the ioc guidelines only apply for the beijing games and not future olympics .

international olympic committee president jacques rogge did not explicitly mention the blogs , but did reiterate on saturday that athletes were able to speak freely in beijing within the rules of the olympic charter .
" the athletes have the right to freely express themselves , " rogge said .
" if they want to criticise china they can do it at home or in china in a public place . "
the charter prohibits demonstrations of a political , religious or racial nature in all olympic areas including the athletes ' village .
" the reason is that in the olympic village there are 205 national olympic committees .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge is under pressure for his flip-flop on internet access to reporters at the beijing olympics " with his catastrophic crisis management and contradictory information , rogge has seriously undermined the olympic spirit and respect for human rights in china , " ulrich delius , asia expert at the goettingen-based society for threatened peoples said on sunday .
the group , whose web site is among a number of sensitive sites blocked by the chinese government , accused rogge of " caving in " to the arbitrary demands of the chinese regime and have called on the ioc chief to resign .
amnesty accuses ioc of flawed behavior at a press conference on saturday , rogge said no deal had been cut with chinese authorities to allow censorship of sensitive sites , after journalists arrived this week to find they could not access a wide range of websites .
but rogge stopped short of offering an apology despite the flood of criticism after china backtracked on internet freedoms for the visiting press .
" i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for .
we are not running the internet in china , " rogge said .
amnesty international accused the ioc of serious flaws in their handling of the situation .
" the ioc never really took a clear stance and did n't really press the chinese to stick to the promises they made on human rights and press freedom , " the head of amnesty international 's germany chapter , barbara lochbiler , said in an interview with german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung .
though china has eased restrictions following international criticism of its internet censorship , many sites such as those of the falun gong still remain blocked .
" censorship a blow against press freedom " german foreign frank-walter steinmeier urged china to lift curbs on the media .
" i do n't understand why the chinese government once again limited internet access and sparked international skepticism , " steinmeier told der spiegel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no photos , no questions - china 's curbs on press freedom have sparked international condemnation leading german newspapers and television stations have castigated what they call censorship by a dictatorial regime .
berthold kohler , chairman of the publishing board of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily said it was hardly surprising that beijing wanted to control and restrict media reporting even during the games .
he pointed out that the chinese authorities have so far prevented the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and other international newspapers from being available daily on the stands in beijing .
even at the " german house " in beijing , the papers would be available with the usual two to three-day delay during the games , kohler said , adding that the chinese authorities justified it by saying they needed to first " check " the papers ' content .
" this censorship is a blow against press freedom whether it 's before , during or after the olympic games , " he said .
poettering wants a signal on tibet the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering weighed into the spiraling debate on human rights and press freedom at the olympics on sunday .
in an article in german newspaper bild am sonntag , poettering called on olympic athletes to protest against human right violations in tibet .

no official should prevent that , " he added , insisting that a love of sport and the olympic games is no excuse for " blurring our outlook " on human rights .

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .

in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .

mbeki vehemently denied the allegation .
" the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal , " a statement from his office said .
both mbeki and zuma bribed ?
the sunday times quoted a secret report compiled in 2007 by a british consultant , commissioned by an unnamed central european manufacturer to investigate man ferrostaal , which had launched a hostile takeover bid against it .
according to the times , mbeki gave 2 million rands of the money to current vice president jacob zuma and the rest to the ruling party , the african national congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is a giant german engineering company the report was published as zuma faces a fraud and corruption trial in connection with allegedly taking of bribes from arms dealers .
court proceedings are expected to take place this month .
the statement from mbeki 's office called the newspaper report nothing " but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the government 's strategic defense procurement package .
" this time , the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain , i.e. president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal , " it said .
thyssenkrupp under investigation in a separate 1994 south african deal to purchase four german-made warships , or corvettes , german prosecutors are also investigating alleged kickbacks for south african officials .
the company in question , thyssenkrupp , part of a german consortium that produced the corvettes , confirmed in april that they had paid an african intermediary $ 22 million for " the usual commissions " but said they had declared it in their contract and there was no evidence of corruption .
in that deal , the post-apartheid government in south africa decided in 1994 to buy new warships , but the german consortium was scratched from the five-country shortlist of suppliers in december of that year .
by that point , only british and spanish suppliers were left in the race .
but four weeks later , the germans suddenly came back onto the shortlist , with then-vice president mbeki announcing during a visit by a german minister and businessman that the issue was wide open .
the germans then moved to the front in a complicated tendering procedure and an order for the four warships was signed on december 3 , 1999 .
the decision was criticized in south africa , with an inquiry concluding in 2001 that the germans should have been eliminated in the first round for failing to meet several requirements , according to german news weekly , der spiegel , in april . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .

but one ngo is going further : it 's in the process of constructing europe 's greenest building . on the shores of lake geneva , ground is being broken - for a ground-breaking building .
the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- is building its new headquarters on the shores of lake geneva in western switzerland . “ our aim is to show the swiss building industry and perhaps the whole european building industry that you can build with less money , but in a sustainable way , and that it doesn ’ t cost more than a normal building - perhaps even less , ” said the iucn 's chief administrator merja murdoch , who is overseeing the construction project . environmental soundness is taken into consideration , even in the smaller details - like with the use of recycled cement and special technology that circulates the air in each office space , said alison rowles , iucn ’ s director of global operations .
recycled office chairs are also in the works . the new headquarters , to be completed by the end of next year , will be completely energy-efficient , too , explained murdoch . “ energy will be created by the geothermal heat that we get from the ground , " she said , " and photovoltaic panels on the roof will create the electricity we use for lighting and for our computers . " if we produce more than we need , the rest will go into the rig , ” she added . out to win the prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the office chairs inside will be recycled the iucn is aiming for official recognition for its efforts - what ’ s known as platinum approval from the united states ' green building council , the highest of the group 's four certification levels . " if you really have a committed plan , which we do , and you have a committed design-team , which we do , it is very doable within the project requirements -lrb- to achieve platinum -rrb- , but it is not easy , ” said michael holz , a consultant architect on the iucn project . iucn also has plans for the area surrounding its new headquarters .
what 's now just a huge mountain of earth next to the construction site will soon be made into a meadow , which should offer more than just a nice view for employees . " the idea is that some very rare species of irises might take up here , " said murdoch .
" we hope so . ” as far as the view goes , workers also have lake geneva and the alps just outside their windows , which will be equipped with a sun-shading system that allows them to control how much light comes in while still enjoying the view . imogen foulkes -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , dw-world.de spoke to german aids researcher hans jaeger who says he 's optimistic about finding a cure to the deadly virus . dw-world.de : more than 25 years after the emergence of the aids epidemic what are the chances of finding a cure to what has largely become a treatable disease ? dr. hans jaeger : we can say that at the beginning we were working with a disease that was not treatable at all , and the majority of patients died relatively quickly .
then starting in the middle of the 90s - due to a variety of improvements such as a better recognition of how the virus spreads and the ability to measure the virus in the blood but particularly thanks to new medicines to develop treatments - the disease became more treatable . our next goal is a cure - the medical word for it would be eradication . that means having the ability to remove the virus from the body or to suppress it to the point where it can no long do any damage .
that is our main goal at the moment . i personally believe we will reach this goal because the progress we are making against hiv is much larger than in other comparable serious diseases .
at the moment we have medicines that are better than ever at treating patients and possibly even healing them . why do you think a cure could be reached soon ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new drugs are doing a better job at suppressing the virus when we look at the progress of the last four to six years and use it to extrapolate the future then we can imagine a cure .
at the moment it 's only a small step away .
in 80 percent to 90 percent of the patients we treat with today 's medicines , we do not see the virus , though when the treatment stops the virus comes back . in recent years there have been more medicines approved initially for very advanced patients .
when we use these medicines with other standard medicines very soon after a patient has been infected then i think we have a good chance of developing a treatment that approaches a cure within seven to eight years .
data gathered in the past few years supports this with admittedly small sample groups showing that what used to be completely unimaginable is fundamentally possible . does the incubation time for hiv infection play a role in determining how well patients can be treated ? there is a theory that the patients who are very recently infected are the best to treat .
there is also data showing that it is not always necessary and that it does not always lead to success . we presented a large study at a conference last year where we showed that regardless of how early you start , after one to two years of treatment with today 's medicines there is no major difference in results .
that leads me to believe that we should not only try to treat newly-infected patients but also include patients suffering chronically from the disease in our research projects and trials .
these are also the patients who make up the majority of people infected . you are going to the annual international aids conference in mexico city .
what projects are you presenting there ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions are spent on aids research we have been asked to make presentations on about 10 research projects .
let me tell you about two of the most interesting . one project of interest around the world has to do with a homeopathic medicine : it was originally developed in brazil and then very heavily used in south africa , but it was one in which we did not think much could be done with .
we conducted a pilot study and found that patients who did not show satisfactory improvement to their immune systems when treated with our regular medicines did , in fact , improve when they received this homeopathic medicine for a period of several months . this shows the closing of a circle .
a medicine from brazil travels to south africa , is then researched and tested by us in a western country .
we were very skeptical about the project and can show in mexico that this relatively inexpensive homeopathic substance can lead to improvements of the immune system . another very important point deals with older hiv patients .
in 10 years the vast majority of patients will be over 50 .
that used to be unfathomable because patients were 20 years old and did n't live to be older than 32 .
now we are dealing with more and more patients who are up to 70 or 80 years old and who are , of course , suffering from other diseases .
we can show that older patients can fight the hiv virus with medicine just as well as younger patients but do not show the same improvements to the immune system as younger patients . what are the new challenges facing hiv research ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a cure be less than 10 years down the track ?
there are many challenges .
one major challenge is a vaccine - i do not think we 're going to have a vaccine we will be able to use worldwide in the next 10 years though it is desperately needed .
major vaccination studies have been stopped over the past few weeks and we , unfortunately , do not expect to find a vaccine .
but it remains a very important goal to prevent new infections . but there are other possibilities in the biological and medical fields to prevent new infections .
we know , for example , that people who do have any detectable viruses because they are successfully treated hardly ever infect others because the virus has been suppressed .
these people then no longer pose a danger as far as new infections are concerned .
the swiss have conducted important research projects in this area . the conference in mexico city will certainly discuss this in detail . but the major challenge - and the thing my patients continually ask me - is when are we going to have a cure for this disease .
some of my colleagues are of a different opinion , but i think finding a cure is a realistic expectation . when do you think we will see a cure ? i think we will be close to a cure in the next eight years or so and will have also cured the first patient . interview : eva usi -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his descendants have extended it and put it on display . at his villa in berlin 's lush green dahlem district , gerstenberg 's collection kept growing in the early part of the 20th century , with the spectrum of art ranging from old masters to the work of impressionist painters like renoir , monet , sisley and degas .
there were also superb graphics , etchings and prints by durer , goya and rembrandt , and lithographs by honore daumier , the french cartoonist and painter who delighted in satirising the bourgeois society of his day .
by the time he died in 1935 , aged 87 , gerstenberg had amassed in his collection the almost entire lithographical oeuvre of henri de toulouse-lautrec .
then came world war ii , and his treasured collection was stashed away in a city flak-bunker .
seized by the russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collection is placed in the former egyptian museum much of the collection was destroyed or seized by the russian army during the battle for berlin in 1945 .
hauled back to russia as war booty , part of the collection has since 1995 been displayed in the eremitage museum in st. petersburg and pushkin museum in moscow .
in berlin , what remained of the gerstenberg collection was passed to his daughter margarethe scharf and , after her death , to her two sons , walther and dieter , where it became a starting point for their own art collections .
that they carried on the art tradition of their grandfather is illustrated by an extraordinary exhibition titled " surreal worlds " at the city 's new " scharf-gerstenberg " museum , across the way from the imposing charlottenburg palace .
named in tribute to otto gerstenberg , the berlin exhibition owes much of its richness to the canny collecting skill of grandson dieter scharf .
extending the collection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the doll " by hans bellmer he upgraded the remainder of the earlier collection with exquisite examples of surrealistic art by max ernst , salvador dali and rene magritte , and with works by odilon redon , paul klee and jean dubuffet .
the scharf-gerstenberg show encompasses 300 works of " surrealism and its predecessors , " and has created excitement with its spectacular examples of dark architectural prison scenes by italian engraver giovanni battista piranesi -lrb- 1720-1778 -rrb- .
julietta scharf , a family descendent , who acts as president of the gerstenberg art foundation , says the " surreal art " exhibits are not a present to berlin , but are on a ten-year-loan , with conditions attached .
one of them being that they do not disappear into depots but remain on display on a permanent basis to the public .
fragile paperwork bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors to charlottenburg palace -lrb- in picture -rrb- can now walk across the street to see surrealist worlds two-thirds of the scharf-gerstenberg collection features fragile paperwork - charcoal sketches , pencilled illustrations and collages .
a small and beautiful 1953 jean dubuffet collage stems from butterfly 's wings .
a stream of visitors have been arriving at the exhibition , with its heavy emphasis on surrealism , and drawings and collages by the likes of hans bellmer , louis soutter and dubuffet .
the new scharf-gerstenberg museum results from the transfer in 2005 of the famed nofretete bust and the egyptian museum 's papyrus collection from west to east to the city 's famous " museum island . "
this enabled architect friedrich august stueler 's historic cluster of museum buildings near the charlottenburg palace to be redesigned for modern art purposes .
a museum city berlin now boasts 147 museums - almost double the number found in most other german cities .
museum attendances have spiralled in berlin in recent years , in contrast to most other german cities , where figure have been in decline in recent years .
in 2005 , some 11.43 million people visited berlin museums - a surplus of more than 145,000 on the preceding year 's figures , and attendances soared again in 2006-7 .
berlin 's wirtschaft -lrb- economic -rrb- magazine forecasts that this year city museum attendance will again rise , due to the city 's natural history museum , with its star -lrb- 13.27-meter high -rrb- dinosaur skeleton attraction , reopening again after lengthy restoration .
also , the bode museum in berlin housing classical sculptures and antiquities , draws large crowds again on the museum island , after a 152-million-euro -lrb- $ 236-million -rrb- " face-lift . "
" everyone in germany should at least one time in their lives pay a visit to the museum island in berlin , " the nation 's chancellor angela merkel observed not so long ago .
bildunterschrift : the spectacular bode museum is another must for art history buffs art galleries galore not only do the number of museums carry on increasing in berlin .
art galleries also multiply , with 380 galleries at last count , and more in the pipeline .
werner tammen , chairman of the city 's association of berliner galleries , claims berlin has turned into a unique " melting pot " for the arts ; one , " with enormous potential for the future of the city 's cultural economy . "
in that sense , berlin has left london and new york trailing , he suggests .
but not all is sweet and honey .

dr morgan will make his call at wales ' leading cultural festival , the national eisteddfod in cardiff .
he will say wales faces a challenge of keeping its identity and rejoicing in it without " excluding others " .
dr morgan was leaving the lambeth conference gathering of anglican leaders early to preach at the service .
he will say the eisteddfod is a time to celebrate wales as a nation and the welsh language .
but he will warn that any debate about race and nationality could lead to violence and hatred .
wales , he said , had to learn to preserve its identity without allowing that process to become destructive .
' god 's gifts ' he will outline how the gospel of jesus warned against the danger of trying to establish an exclusive club .
instead , it challenged people to reject the drive that can make individuals , families and nations exclude others .
" the particularities of culture , language and tradition are god 's gifts to us for they define who and what we are , " dr morgan will tell worshippers .
" but we also need to foster openness towards those who are different , the peoples and nations of our divided world . "
eisteddfod chief executive elfed roberts said : " we do appreciate the fact that dr morgan is leaving the lambeth conference early to preach at wales ' prime cultural festival . "

the relay began with a minute 's silence in guang 'an city , honouring almost 70,000 people killed in the quake .
later , the streets of the city echoed with shouts of " go china " and " go olympics " from the enthusiastic crowds .
sichuan is the last stop for the flame before it heads to beijing for friday 's opening ceremony of the games .
the torch was initially planned to visit sichuan in mid-june , but that was postponed because of the quake .
' sichuan 's spirit ' the first torchbearer on the 90-minute run around guang 'an was police officer jiang min , who lost 10 relatives in the catastrophe , including her parents and her two-year-old daughter .
china relay cities in focus use the map to see the full olympic torch relay route or read about some of the key cities : full route map , hong kong , guangzhou , xiamen , jinggangshan , shanghai , nanjing , huangshan , three gorges , kaili , lhasa , urumqi , xian , yanji , qufu , anyang , beijing .
" i will bring the olympic spirit to my work and we can rebuild the homeland through our joint efforts , " she told the state-run xinhua news agency after finishing her leg .
correspondents say the sichuan section is likely to be an emotional and poignant one .
government worker li lei , who joined the exuberant crowds , told the associated press how he cried when the torch run began .
" for my parents and my family who were greatly affected by the disaster , this is of tremendous significance , " said the 28-year-old .
" for the olympic spirit and for sichuan 's spirit , this is a great thing . "
guang 'an is about 190 miles -lrb- 300km -rrb- from the epicentre of the quake and escaped largely unscathed .
reconstruction efforts have continued in earnest since the disaster , which left about five million people homeless .

the union representing ground staff accepted a 5.1 % pay rise this year and a 2.3 % increase from july 2009 .
however , 130 flights were cancelled on saturday and sunday as the airline attempted to clear a backlog of maintenance work .
lufthansa hopes to reduce the number of cancellations to 40 by tuesday .
the strike had involved about 5,000 members of the verdi trade union who had demanded a 9.8 % pay rise .
they began an indefinite strike last monday .
lufthansa said the pay settlement , which ends in february 2010 , represented " a compromise at the bearable limit " .
the deal also includes a one-off performance-related bonus of up to 2.4 % of annual pay .
" it is imperative that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity , " the airline said .
like other airlines around the world , lufthansa is facing both the rising cost of airline fuel and a slowdown in spending on travel .
its net profits of 402m euros -lrb- £ 317m : $ 625m -rrb- were almost 60 % lower in the first six months of the year , compared to the same period in 2007 .
the union had estimated that the strike would cost lufthansa 5m euros a day .

he said negotiations were under way with surrey county council , which owns the old court lodge secondary school site .
sue child , head teacher of oakwood school , said the project would have given pupils an on-site swimming pool , but said the children would use the new pool at the different site when it was built .

the latest arrival at marwell zoo in bishops waltham , near winchester , is called tiye - named after a beautiful queen of ancient egypt .
the young giraffe , born in june , is being looked after by her mother , mary , and is doing well , a spokesman said .
the birth follows that of christa in may , she is being reared by her mother matilda .
she was named after her father christopher who died last year .
ian goodwin , head keeper for the giraffes , said : " we are thrilled that christa and tiye are doing so well .
" christa is full of energy and tiye is looking every inch like her mum and dad as she has inherited their attractive dark markings . "
