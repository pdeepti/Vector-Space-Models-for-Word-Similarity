aside from the elaborate costumes and sopranos named brunhilde , less and less , it seems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original bayreuth venue was overseen by the composer himself like 2006 world cup organizers , who showed the soccer matches in public squares for free to thousands of fans who could not get tickets to the sold-out events , bayreuth festival planners are considering broadcasting of some of richard wagner 's operas . following a trend in fact , the idea is not new in opera circles : vienna , sydney and liverpool are just a handful of cities that regularly broadcast opera-house productions on large screens in town squares , free of charge , in order to allow more people to experience the performance . free-broadcasting performances from the uber-exclusive festival of wagner operas , held annually in bayreuth , could bring opera-populism to a new level .
the average time spent waiting for coveted bayreuth festival tickets is eight years . festival spokesman peter emmerich told news agencies on wednesday , feb .
27 , that organizers were mulling trying out the arrangement for one opera this season , with the aim of fulfilling romantic composer richard wagners 's hopes of making bayreuth a " festival for all . " likely venue : a town square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are " parsifal " fans more likely to be subdued ?
emmerich said a likely venue might be a town square with space for about 1,000 people , who would not need tickets .
he also said it remains unclear which opera might be chosen , although he ruled out the " ring " cycle on the grounds that it just too long .
possibilities include " parsifal " and " the master singers of nuremberg . " the annual bayreuth festival draws a roster of rich and famous attendees , and is a pilgrimage destination for wagner enthusiasts .
up to now , performances have been held only in the famed festspielhaus theater , whose design and construction was overseen by the composer himself . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 02.03.2008 breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are one step closer to having something to celebrate former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany . paul breitner spent most of his professional soccer career , which lasted from 1970 to 1983 , at bayern munich and real madrid .
a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2008 german publishers struggle with book bans for privacy reasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a history of banning - and burning - books more and more publishing houses are facing law suits in germany , with plaintiffs demanding forbearance .
the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .

in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature .

" just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aside from the elaborate costumes and sopranos named brunhilde , less and less , it seems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original bayreuth venue was overseen by the composer himself like 2006 world cup organizers , who showed the soccer matches in public squares for free to thousands of fans who could not get tickets to the sold-out events , bayreuth festival planners are considering broadcasting of some of richard wagner 's operas . following a trend in fact , the idea is not new in opera circles : vienna , sydney and liverpool are just a handful of cities that regularly broadcast opera-house productions on large screens in town squares , free of charge , in order to allow more people to experience the performance . free-broadcasting performances from the uber-exclusive festival of wagner operas , held annually in bayreuth , could bring opera-populism to a new level .
the average time spent waiting for coveted bayreuth festival tickets is eight years . festival spokesman peter emmerich told news agencies on wednesday , feb .
27 , that organizers were mulling trying out the arrangement for one opera this season , with the aim of fulfilling romantic composer richard wagners 's hopes of making bayreuth a " festival for all . " likely venue : a town square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are " parsifal " fans more likely to be subdued ?
emmerich said a likely venue might be a town square with space for about 1,000 people , who would not need tickets .
he also said it remains unclear which opera might be chosen , although he ruled out the " ring " cycle on the grounds that it just too long .
possibilities include " parsifal " and " the master singers of nuremberg . " the annual bayreuth festival draws a roster of rich and famous attendees , and is a pilgrimage destination for wagner enthusiasts .
up to now , performances have been held only in the famed festspielhaus theater , whose design and construction was overseen by the composer himself . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .

aside from the elaborate costumes and sopranos named brunhilde , less and less , it seems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original bayreuth venue was overseen by the composer himself like 2006 world cup organizers , who showed the soccer matches in public squares for free to thousands of fans who could not get tickets to the sold-out events , bayreuth festival planners are considering broadcasting of some of richard wagner 's operas . following a trend in fact , the idea is not new in opera circles : vienna , sydney and liverpool are just a handful of cities that regularly broadcast opera-house productions on large screens in town squares , free of charge , in order to allow more people to experience the performance . free-broadcasting performances from the uber-exclusive festival of wagner operas , held annually in bayreuth , could bring opera-populism to a new level .
the average time spent waiting for coveted bayreuth festival tickets is eight years . festival spokesman peter emmerich told news agencies on wednesday , feb .
27 , that organizers were mulling trying out the arrangement for one opera this season , with the aim of fulfilling romantic composer richard wagners 's hopes of making bayreuth a " festival for all . " likely venue : a town square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are " parsifal " fans more likely to be subdued ?
emmerich said a likely venue might be a town square with space for about 1,000 people , who would not need tickets .
he also said it remains unclear which opera might be chosen , although he ruled out the " ring " cycle on the grounds that it just too long .
possibilities include " parsifal " and " the master singers of nuremberg . " the annual bayreuth festival draws a roster of rich and famous attendees , and is a pilgrimage destination for wagner enthusiasts .
up to now , performances have been held only in the famed festspielhaus theater , whose design and construction was overseen by the composer himself . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 02.03.2008 breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are one step closer to having something to celebrate former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany . paul breitner spent most of his professional soccer career , which lasted from 1970 to 1983 , at bayern munich and real madrid .
a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2008 german publishers struggle with book bans for privacy reasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a history of banning - and burning - books more and more publishing houses are facing law suits in germany , with plaintiffs demanding forbearance .
the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 02.03.2008 breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are one step closer to having something to celebrate former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany . paul breitner spent most of his professional soccer career , which lasted from 1970 to 1983 , at bayern munich and real madrid .
a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aside from the elaborate costumes and sopranos named brunhilde , less and less , it seems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original bayreuth venue was overseen by the composer himself like 2006 world cup organizers , who showed the soccer matches in public squares for free to thousands of fans who could not get tickets to the sold-out events , bayreuth festival planners are considering broadcasting of some of richard wagner 's operas . following a trend in fact , the idea is not new in opera circles : vienna , sydney and liverpool are just a handful of cities that regularly broadcast opera-house productions on large screens in town squares , free of charge , in order to allow more people to experience the performance . free-broadcasting performances from the uber-exclusive festival of wagner operas , held annually in bayreuth , could bring opera-populism to a new level .
the average time spent waiting for coveted bayreuth festival tickets is eight years . festival spokesman peter emmerich told news agencies on wednesday , feb .
27 , that organizers were mulling trying out the arrangement for one opera this season , with the aim of fulfilling romantic composer richard wagners 's hopes of making bayreuth a " festival for all . " likely venue : a town square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are " parsifal " fans more likely to be subdued ?
emmerich said a likely venue might be a town square with space for about 1,000 people , who would not need tickets .
he also said it remains unclear which opera might be chosen , although he ruled out the " ring " cycle on the grounds that it just too long .
possibilities include " parsifal " and " the master singers of nuremberg . " the annual bayreuth festival draws a roster of rich and famous attendees , and is a pilgrimage destination for wagner enthusiasts .
up to now , performances have been held only in the famed festspielhaus theater , whose design and construction was overseen by the composer himself . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .

aside from the elaborate costumes and sopranos named brunhilde , less and less , it seems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original bayreuth venue was overseen by the composer himself like 2006 world cup organizers , who showed the soccer matches in public squares for free to thousands of fans who could not get tickets to the sold-out events , bayreuth festival planners are considering broadcasting of some of richard wagner 's operas . following a trend in fact , the idea is not new in opera circles : vienna , sydney and liverpool are just a handful of cities that regularly broadcast opera-house productions on large screens in town squares , free of charge , in order to allow more people to experience the performance . free-broadcasting performances from the uber-exclusive festival of wagner operas , held annually in bayreuth , could bring opera-populism to a new level .
the average time spent waiting for coveted bayreuth festival tickets is eight years . festival spokesman peter emmerich told news agencies on wednesday , feb .
27 , that organizers were mulling trying out the arrangement for one opera this season , with the aim of fulfilling romantic composer richard wagners 's hopes of making bayreuth a " festival for all . " likely venue : a town square bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are " parsifal " fans more likely to be subdued ?
emmerich said a likely venue might be a town square with space for about 1,000 people , who would not need tickets .
he also said it remains unclear which opera might be chosen , although he ruled out the " ring " cycle on the grounds that it just too long .
possibilities include " parsifal " and " the master singers of nuremberg . " the annual bayreuth festival draws a roster of rich and famous attendees , and is a pilgrimage destination for wagner enthusiasts .
up to now , performances have been held only in the famed festspielhaus theater , whose design and construction was overseen by the composer himself . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial .

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2008 german publishers struggle with book bans for privacy reasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a history of banning - and burning - books more and more publishing houses are facing law suits in germany , with plaintiffs demanding forbearance .
the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2008 german publishers struggle with book bans for privacy reasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a history of banning - and burning - books more and more publishing houses are facing law suits in germany , with plaintiffs demanding forbearance .
the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 02.03.2008 breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are one step closer to having something to celebrate former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany . paul breitner spent most of his professional soccer career , which lasted from 1970 to 1983 , at bayern munich and real madrid .
a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2008 german publishers struggle with book bans for privacy reasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a history of banning - and burning - books more and more publishing houses are facing law suits in germany , with plaintiffs demanding forbearance .
the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 02.03.2008 breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are one step closer to having something to celebrate former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany . paul breitner spent most of his professional soccer career , which lasted from 1970 to 1983 , at bayern munich and real madrid .
a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial .

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2008 german publishers struggle with book bans for privacy reasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a history of banning - and burning - books more and more publishing houses are facing law suits in germany , with plaintiffs demanding forbearance .
the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .

a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de teams -pipe- 02.03.2008 breitner : bayern will become one of world 's top three teams großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans are one step closer to having something to celebrate former german national team player and world cup winner paul breitner , now a consultant for bayern munich , told dw-world.de about the future prospects of the team that has won more titles than any other in germany . paul breitner spent most of his professional soccer career , which lasted from 1970 to 1983 , at bayern munich and real madrid .
a member of the 1974 world cup and 1972 european championships winning teams , many experts see him as among the top midfielders of his day . this interview took place prior to bayern munich 's 1-0 win over munich 1860 in the german cup quarterfinals on wednesday , feb .
27 ..
the game was decided by a franck ribery penalty kick in the last minute of extra time . dw-world.de : mr. breitner , are you and the directors of fc bayern munich satisfied with the way the season , both domestically and internationally , has been going ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his days as a player , breitner was easily recognized from anywhere on the field paul breitner : yes , we 're very satisfied , especially with our participation in the uefa cup .
we 're also at the top of the bundesliga table .
everything is going well . still , there are always reports coming out of munich about troubles , discussions and internal problems ... no !
that 's simply not the case - not for the club management and not for the team .
we almost never find out where these reports come from .
bayern munich attracts a lot of attention , and a lot of people make what could happen there their business .
if months go by without anything happening then someone comes up with the idea that something is in the works .
here in the team we 've learned how to live with stories that do n't exist . has bayern moved beyond local , domestic soccer to an international or global level ? none of the world 's leading clubs have a local mentality .
take arsenal london as an example : the team played its last champions league match with 11 foreign players - not a single englishman .
that 's become normal for other big teams in england like chelsea and liverpool , which put seven or eight foreigners on the field .
in other parts of europe it 's the same .
the local mentality has been passe for six or seven years . when it comes to fielding an international team , bayern munich has had some problems with south american players like julio dos santos , roque santa cruz and even martin demichelis , who after five years in germany is just starting to meet expectations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since retiring , he 's toned down his appearance but maybe this was n't their problem , but one of development as players .
these days martin demichelis is an important part of the bayern team and a member of the argentine national squad .
it 's not unusual for two south american players out of six , seven or eight to perform below expectations .
we 're currently very happy with our latin american players like ze roberto and lucio , and we expect big things from jose sosa .
times are very good for our players from argentina and brazil . are players like sosa and new brazilian arrival breno a sign of what 's to come in the future for bayern ? of course .
we do n't want to buy just 27 or 28-year-old players with experience in the bundesliga or other european leagues .
we 've turned around our transfer policy .
that 's why we 've signed so many very young players in the past few months .
sosa is a good example .
we have big expectations for him because he has a lot of talent .
he 's working on getting back into the rhythm of playing after being out injured for six months .
we 've put a lot of confidence in him as well as breno - one of the best players his age whom i 've seen in the last 15 years .
they 're players with bright futures for the coming season and the coming years . are you planning for a model like arsenal 's , where the average age is under 26 ? no , we ca n't and do n't want to take the same road as arsenal .
over there players are bought in groups of 10 or 15 at a time .
we do n't have that much money available and ca n't spend those kinds of enormous sums .
arsenal have their way , and we have ours .
when we need two or three players we 'll look for them and that 's it . is bayern munich in store for a big shake-up in july when juergen klinsmann takes over as coach or will the team continue the way it has in the past ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi is taking over the controls at bayern at the end of the season no , we started with the big shake-up 12 months ago in the spring of 2007 when we bought eight new players , including franck ribery , miroslav klose , ze roberto and luca toni .
that was an uncommon situation .
now we have a solid team and no new acquisitions are necessary .
maybe two or three players who can contribute something positive , but not as much as before - bayern do n't need it anymore . there is still speculation that the new coaching staff is going to make some dramatic changes . sorry , but i ca n't and do n't want to talk about that .
until june 30 , our coach 's name is ottmar hitzfeld .
it would n't be appropriate to talk about what juergen klinsmann might change in the club management or the team .
that 's all for the future . then what can we expect from the team before the end of this season ? we do n't exactly know .
bayern munich does n't have 70 or 80 million euros to spend every year - that 's money we 've already spent .
now we have to wait to see how many titles we can win .
then , as of july 1 , we 'll have a new coach and that will put us in a very different situation , so we have to keep things calm .
we are very , very pleased and very confident that the winning days of munich are returning - the days when we used to play in the champions league every year . do you and the bayern directors feel like you 've acted in a way that ensures the team 's successful future ? we are convinced that everything is going to end with a lot of success for the team .
personally , i think that bayern is going to again be one of the three most important soccer clubs in the world . interview : daniel martinez -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dividing line between allowing literature and protecting personal rights is a controversial matter . it began it 1971 with a major piece of literature : klaus mann 's novel " mephisto " was banned after a legal battle spanning over years . the federal constitutional court ruled that the personal rights of the deceased actor gustav gruendgens took precedence over freedom of speech .
gruendgens 's involvement during the nazi reign was hardly disguised in the novel . the book , however , was still obtainable in the gdr at the time , and was reprinted six times .
it was allowed to be distributed in western germany as of 1981 . since the mephisto battle , courts have repeatedly had to address just how far the " freedom of expression " argument can go when people recognize themselves in novels , films or theater works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late actor gustav gruendgens sometimes judges rule in favor of personal rights , and sometimes in favor of freedom of expression and the press . but , the legal departments of publishing houses have been particularly busy over the past few years . sueing over a single sentence " law suits are occurring more and more , " said rainer dresen , director of the legal department at the german branch of publisher random house .
" sometimes it 's just due to a sentence that is vague - in order to get a book whose content is generally disliked or unpopular from the market . " the boom in law suits is primarily connected to two specific rulings .
in 2004 , the european court of human rights restricted the range of reporting on celebrities or prominent people in the so-called " caroline ruling " - a case which princess caroline of monaco brought before the court . the other ruling was in germany in 2007 , when the federal constitutional court banned the further distribution of maxim biller 's novel " esra , " for what it called " infringing on personal space . " the author 's former girlfriend had said she recognized herself in the book 's protagonist .
the book was banned , and the woman was awarded 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- in damages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboo subject : princess caroline critics of the " esra ruling " see this as the start of a development in which rulings in legal cases concerning yellow journalism are carried over to literature . " it 's true there have been more objections as of late , " said peter roeder , managing director of the suhrkamp publishing house in frankfurt . in the past , people may have just been annoyed or even felt flattered . now , " people are making demands much more aggressively , " said dresen of random house . from the cellar to bestseller the need to protect personal rights is handled very differently in other countries .
the unauthorized biography " girl in the cellar - the natascha kampusch story " was allowed to be published in england , but not in germany .
the guardian quipped : " from the cellar to bestseller . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maxim biller 's book was banned in 2006 , a frankfurt court banned the screening of the film " the cannibal from rohtenburg . "
the court said that armin meiwes did not have to accept that the film portrayed a life and crime so similar to his own . the film , however , was shown at the prestigious sitges film festival in catalonia , where it received awards for " best director " and " best actor . " just last week , the berlin district court confirmed an interim injunction banning the book " interview with a cannibal " about meiwes 's life .
meiwes 's relatives objected to the publication of details about their personal lives , even though the book was written with the cooperation of the cannibal . from taboo to liberal in an international comparison , germany stands somewhere between france and the united states when it comes to protecting personal rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes in court , but not in the movie " france strongly protects private lives - they are completely taboo , " said karl-nikolaus peifer , a media and communications law professor . currently , french journalist airy routier could face imprisonment because he reported in nouvel observateur about an sms which nicolas sarkozy supposedly sent to his ex-wife in which he asked for her to come back to him .
the president sued the magazine on fabrication grounds and the distribution of false information . in the us , on the other hand , freedom of expression is prized , and shelters everything from hate speeches to pornography and holocaust denial . " people do not have a real idea of personal rights there , " peifer said . dresen agreed . " our american colleagues are amazed by the situation in germany , " he said . he also believes little can be done about the wave of law suits rolling through the country - other than hoping that the tide will eventually turn in favor of freedom of expression and the press and away from preliminary injunctions . oliver samson -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although he was invited by iraqi president jalal talabani , it is a controversial and potentially divisive state visit , as well as a security challenge .
many sunni arabs find it deeply objectionable that iraqi hospitality is being offered to a man they suspect of covertly helping to finance and arm shia militia groups .
those groups have killed hundreds of iraqis in gruesome attacks that often involve torture with electric drills .
one sunni tribal leader believes the iranian president is coming here " to organise more terrorist operations in iraq " .
iranian instructor the united states also believes iran has helped shia groups in iraq - especially helping develop " shaped " or " explosively penetrating " rounds .
iran regards the us as an occupation force in iraq , and considers resistance to be legitimate these are chillingly effective roadside bombs that launch molten metal when they are detonated ; the force of the explosion propels the molten rounds at such high speed that they can penetrate military armour .
and just a day before the iranian presidential visit , the us military said they had captured a man they described as a sniper instructor " trained in iran " .
they said he was also an expert in the design and use of those penetrating rounds .
but iran regards the us as an occupation force in iraq , and considers resistance to be legitimate .
before leaving for iraq , mr ahmadinejad laughed off american accusations of iranian interference .
" is it not funny that those with 160,000 forces in iraq accuse us of interference ? " he asked .
careful arrangements the president 's visit is a complex security challenge .
baghdad international airport , where he arrived , is directly alongside the mostly american military airbase - and the americans control the airspace .
however , it was thought an iraqi air traffic controller would be on duty for the iranian presidential plane .
the us military believes iran has backed shia militants visiting dignitaries usually head straight from baghdad airport to the fortified green zone - in an american helicopter .
the bbc understands that the iranian president was not offered this facility and a car journey along the seven-kilometre airport road into the city was the likeliest option .
traffic on this road has often been ambushed and attacked - and along much of its length there is only a light fence .
ironic ' allies ' the president will also avoid the green zone , as to gain access to this area - home to the huge american embassy and numerous iraqi government offices - vehicles are required to stop at us checkpoints .
and few american troops would want to wave through a man many in the us believe was one of the students who kidnapped american diplomats in teheran for 444 days soon after the fall of the shah in 1979 .
mahmoud ahmadinejad denies he was involved .
there are also paradoxes associated with this visit .
despite decades of bad blood , iran is a potential us ally - against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
shia iran has little in common with the fundamentalist wahhabists of the taleban and al-qaeda .
enlightened self-interest after the attacks on new york and washington in september 2001 , iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said he was " repulsed " by the loss of civilian lives .
during the following fortnight there were several meetings in geneva between iranian and us officials .
according to diplomats , the iranians urged the us to invade afghanistan as soon as possible and to install a government to oppose the taleban .
tehran also promised $ 500m for the reconstruction of afghanistan .
it was enlightened self-interest .
iran did not want to be sandwiched between two enemies - saddam hussein to the west and the taleban to the east .
it is ironic that both threats to iranian stability were removed ... by the us .

although he was invited by iraqi president jalal talabani , it is a controversial and potentially divisive state visit , as well as a security challenge .
many sunni arabs find it deeply objectionable that iraqi hospitality is being offered to a man they suspect of covertly helping to finance and arm shia militia groups .
those groups have killed hundreds of iraqis in gruesome attacks that often involve torture with electric drills .
one sunni tribal leader believes the iranian president is coming here " to organise more terrorist operations in iraq " .
iranian instructor the united states also believes iran has helped shia groups in iraq - especially helping develop " shaped " or " explosively penetrating " rounds .
iran regards the us as an occupation force in iraq , and considers resistance to be legitimate these are chillingly effective roadside bombs that launch molten metal when they are detonated ; the force of the explosion propels the molten rounds at such high speed that they can penetrate military armour .
and just a day before the iranian presidential visit , the us military said they had captured a man they described as a sniper instructor " trained in iran " .
they said he was also an expert in the design and use of those penetrating rounds .
but iran regards the us as an occupation force in iraq , and considers resistance to be legitimate .
before leaving for iraq , mr ahmadinejad laughed off american accusations of iranian interference .
" is it not funny that those with 160,000 forces in iraq accuse us of interference ? " he asked .
careful arrangements the president 's visit is a complex security challenge .
baghdad international airport , where he arrived , is directly alongside the mostly american military airbase - and the americans control the airspace .
however , it was thought an iraqi air traffic controller would be on duty for the iranian presidential plane .
the us military believes iran has backed shia militants visiting dignitaries usually head straight from baghdad airport to the fortified green zone - in an american helicopter .
the bbc understands that the iranian president was not offered this facility and a car journey along the seven-kilometre airport road into the city was the likeliest option .
traffic on this road has often been ambushed and attacked - and along much of its length there is only a light fence .
ironic ' allies ' the president will also avoid the green zone , as to gain access to this area - home to the huge american embassy and numerous iraqi government offices - vehicles are required to stop at us checkpoints .
and few american troops would want to wave through a man many in the us believe was one of the students who kidnapped american diplomats in teheran for 444 days soon after the fall of the shah in 1979 .
mahmoud ahmadinejad denies he was involved .
there are also paradoxes associated with this visit .
despite decades of bad blood , iran is a potential us ally - against al-qaeda and the taleban in afghanistan .
shia iran has little in common with the fundamentalist wahhabists of the taleban and al-qaeda .
enlightened self-interest after the attacks on new york and washington in september 2001 , iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said he was " repulsed " by the loss of civilian lives .
during the following fortnight there were several meetings in geneva between iranian and us officials .
according to diplomats , the iranians urged the us to invade afghanistan as soon as possible and to install a government to oppose the taleban .
tehran also promised $ 500m for the reconstruction of afghanistan .
it was enlightened self-interest .
iran did not want to be sandwiched between two enemies - saddam hussein to the west and the taleban to the east .
it is ironic that both threats to iranian stability were removed ... by the us .

the future of the plant 's current 7,400 staff was secured with the announcement that they will build wings for a fleet of 179 in-flight refuelling aircraft .
brian fleet , a former broughton apprentice who is now an airbus senior vice president , said it was " highly probable " more staff would be needed .
more orders are expected to follow .
mr fleet said the 179 kc-45a planes were part of a fleet of 500 aircraft which the us air force was expected to want to replace in the near future .
if these other contracts were awarded to airbus , they would be worth around £ 100bn , he said - which would be good news for the industry in north wales .
it 's unbelievable that the us air force will be flying with welsh wings brian fleet , of airbus he said the company was already in the process of recruiting more staff to cope with airbus 's programme , which was expanding even before the announcement of the us air force contract .
now , broughton was likely to need even more workers before 2009 to help with the us air force order , which is due in 2010 and 2011 , mr fleet said .
" it 's great news for the broughton factory , especially this coming on the weekend of st david 's day , " he added .
" it could n't come at a better time .
it 's unbelievable that the us air force will be flying with welsh wings . "
mr fleet said the factory , which currently employs 7,400 staff and an additional 1,500 support staff , such as caterers and cleaners , was staking its claim as the hub of the welsh economy and as a centre of excellence recognised around the world .
the aircraft will refuel us planes in mid-air he said the factory was also providing skills and careers for young people in the area .
" i started as an engineering apprentice at broughton at 18 in 1974 and the company trained me over the years .
i am now a senior vice president of airbus and head of the wing and pylon centre of excellence , " he said .
" that 's the great thing about broughton .
it provides opportunities for local people to have a full career and vocation , something they can immerse themselves in . "
robin southwell , chief executive of airbus 's parent company eads uk , said the us air force deal secured their place in the lucrative military market , following previous orders from the raf and australian air force .
" this is a very big order , many billions of pounds , the order will last for quite a few years and we hope to get other orders on top of this , " he told the bbc news website .
deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones , who is also minister for economic development and transport , said the us air force contract was " another vote of confidence in the skills of the workforce at broughton .
european group eads and the us 's northrop grumman beat us firm boeing to build the fleet of aircraft , which will be assembled at a site in alabama .
it is understood us manufacturer boeing , which had been favourite to win the contract , is expected to appeal against the decision .
however , uk business secretary , john hutton said job cuts , announced last february , would still go ahead the airbus plant at filton near bristol , despite the announcement .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- q & a : russian presidential polls bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 2 march 2008 , 09:23 gmt q & a : russian presidential polls russians are voting on 2 march to elect a new president - the country 's third since the collapse of the soviet union .
the incumbent , vladimir putin , is stepping down at the end of two four-year terms , as prescribed by the constitution .
first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev , 42 , has mr putin 's public backing as his preferred successor , and is regarded as almost certain to win .
what is at stake ?
on paper , quite a lot .
under russia 's constitution , the presidency is by far the most powerful institution in the russian state .
apart from being head of state , the president is in overall charge of setting government policy .
he can veto laws passed by parliament , which needs a two-thirds majority in both houses to overcome the president 's opposition .
the president takes the lead in choosing the prime minister , and while parliament can reject his choice , it can not insist on a candidate of its own .
the president also appoints russia 's regional heads of government .
what are the rules ?
to win , a candidate must get over 50 % of the vote .
failing that , the two highest polling candidates go through to a second round , to be held 21 days after the first .
in order to run , candidates had either to be put forward by a party in parliament , or collect the signatures of two million voters .
polling is staggered across russia 's 11 time zones .
the first polling stations opened at 2000 gmt on 1 march in the far east , with the last closing in the far west at 1800 gmt on 2 march .
around 109 million russians are eligible to vote in russia and abroad .
who is standing ?
dmitry medvedev a close ally of mr putin , mr medvedev is the candidate of the pro-kremlin united russia party .
it has a two-thirds majority in the lower house , the duma .
opinion polls suggest he could win 60-80 % of the vote .
like mr putin and many of the president 's allies , mr medvedev , who previously worked as a lawyer , hails from st petersburg .
however , he lacks mr putin 's background in the security services , and is seen as more liberal .
while promising to continue mr putin 's policies , he has called for less state intervention in the economy , as well as a greater focus on education and social welfare .
credited with a great deal of economic experience , mr medvedev has promised to give russia " decades of stable development " , create a law-abiding society and fight corruption .
gennady zyuganov mr zyuganov , 63 , has been the leader of the communist party of russia since 1993 , and is a long-standing fixture of post-soviet opposition politics .
he came close to beating boris yeltsin in the 1996 election , and stood against mr putin in 2000 .
however , opinion polls currently give him only a 6-15 % share of the vote .
mr zyuganov is a strong critic of russia 's post-soviet economic reforms , and has described capitalism as " barbaric " .
he routinely rails against russia 's super-rich businessmen , the " oligarchs " .
during his campaign , he has called for higher wages and pensions , more affordable housing , and the nationalisation of russia 's lucrative natural resources .
vladimir zhirinovsky another veteran of russian politics , mr zhirinovsky , 61 , is known for his brash and confrontational style .
he has been the leader of the liberal democratic party of russia since its foundation in 1990 .
despite his party 's name , mr zhirinovsky has strongly nationalist , anti-western and authoritarian views .
polls suggest he could win around 10 % of the vote .
he has a record of anti-semitic outbursts , and has a tendency towards political stunts which appeal to popular sentiment .
however , despite his maverick reputation , mr zhirinovsky avoids direct criticism of the kremlin .
building up russia 's military strength is his main political theme .
on domestic policy , his manifesto promises russians " just three projects - housing , good roads and food " .
andrei bogdanov mr bogdanov , 38 , is little known in russia , and seen as something of a mystery candidate .
he leads the democratic party of russia , which won 90,000 votes at the 2007 parliamentary elections - just over 1 % of the total .
however , mr bogdanov is the only candidate to have qualified by collecting two million signatures .
some observers believe he is being sponsored by the kremlin to split the opposition vote .
mr bogdanov describes his party as " liberal conservative " .
his main policy is to seek european union membership for russia .
what about russia 's liberal opposition ?
none of russia 's liberal opposition parties has a candidate in the race .
one opposition leader , former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , was barred from standing after the electoral authorities said signatures collected in his support had been forged .
mr kasyanov described the move as " purely political " , while the central electoral commission insisted it had acted in accordance with the law .
another opposition leader , boris nemtsov , withdrew , saying the election 's outcome had been predetermined .
he had not got to the point of being registered as a candidate .
will the election be free and fair ?
the observer group of the organisation for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- described russia 's last nationwide vote - the parliamentary election in december 2007 - as neither free nor fair .
in the run-up to these elections , opposition candidates complained that state-owned national television stations devoted an overwhelming amount of coverage to dmitry medvedev .
are international observers there ?
yes - but only about 300 international observers for some 96,000 polling stations .
the process was overshadowed by the osce 's decision to boycott the election ; the organisation said that restrictions imposed by russia on its monitors would have made it impossible to do their job .
russia reacted angrily to the move , accusing the osce of making " ultimatums " .
what will mr putin 's role be after the election ?
this has been the subject of intense speculation ; mr putin at least partly dispelled some of the mystery by accepting an offer to become prime minister if mr medvedev is elected .
some observers believe mr medvedev 's candidacy is merely a way for mr putin to maintain influence after formally stepping down , and that the outgoing president will - as prime minister - continue to call the shots .

the incumbent , vladimir putin , is stepping down at the end of two four-year terms , as prescribed by the constitution .
first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev , 42 , has mr putin 's public backing as his preferred successor , and is regarded as almost certain to win .
what is at stake ?
on paper , quite a lot .
under russia 's constitution , the presidency is by far the most powerful institution in the russian state .
apart from being head of state , the president is in overall charge of setting government policy .
he can veto laws passed by parliament , which needs a two-thirds majority in both houses to overcome the president 's opposition .
the president takes the lead in choosing the prime minister , and while parliament can reject his choice , it can not insist on a candidate of its own .
the president also appoints russia 's regional heads of government .
what are the rules ?
to win , a candidate must get over 50 % of the vote .
failing that , the two highest polling candidates go through to a second round , to be held 21 days after the first .
in order to run , candidates had either to be put forward by a party in parliament , or collect the signatures of two million voters .
polling is staggered across russia 's 11 time zones .
the first polling stations opened at 2000 gmt on 1 march in the far east , with the last closing in the far west at 1800 gmt on 2 march .
around 109 million russians are eligible to vote in russia and abroad .
who is standing ?
dmitry medvedev mr medvedev has promised to continue mr putin 's course a close ally of mr putin , mr medvedev is the candidate of the pro-kremlin united russia party .
it has a two-thirds majority in the lower house , the duma .
opinion polls suggest he could win 60-80 % of the vote .
like mr putin and many of the president 's allies , mr medvedev , who previously worked as a lawyer , hails from st petersburg .
however , he lacks mr putin 's background in the security services , and is seen as more liberal .
while promising to continue mr putin 's policies , he has called for less state intervention in the economy , as well as a greater focus on education and social welfare .
credited with a great deal of economic experience , mr medvedev has promised to give russia " decades of stable development " , create a law-abiding society and fight corruption .
gennady zyuganov mr zyuganov , 63 , has been the leader of the communist party of russia since 1993 , and is a long-standing fixture of post-soviet opposition politics .
he came close to beating boris yeltsin in the 1996 election , and stood against mr putin in 2000 .
however , opinion polls currently give him only a 6-15 % share of the vote .
mr zyuganov is a strong critic of russia 's post-soviet economic reforms , and has described capitalism as " barbaric " .
he routinely rails against russia 's super-rich businessmen , the " oligarchs " .
during his campaign , he has called for higher wages and pensions , more affordable housing , and the nationalisation of russia 's lucrative natural resources .
vladimir zhirinovsky another veteran of russian politics , mr zhirinovsky , 61 , is known for his brash and confrontational style .
he has been the leader of the liberal democratic party of russia since its foundation in 1990 .
despite his party 's name , mr zhirinovsky has strongly nationalist , anti-western and authoritarian views .
polls suggest he could win around 10 % of the vote .
he has a record of anti-semitic outbursts , and has a tendency towards political stunts which appeal to popular sentiment .
however , despite his maverick reputation , mr zhirinovsky avoids direct criticism of the kremlin .
building up russia 's military strength is his main political theme .
on domestic policy , his manifesto promises russians " just three projects - housing , good roads and food " .
andrei bogdanov mr bogdanov , 38 , is little known in russia , and seen as something of a mystery candidate .
he leads the democratic party of russia , which won 90,000 votes at the 2007 parliamentary elections - just over 1 % of the total .
however , mr bogdanov is the only candidate to have qualified by collecting two million signatures .
some observers believe he is being sponsored by the kremlin to split the opposition vote .
mr bogdanov describes his party as " liberal conservative " .
his main policy is to seek european union membership for russia .
what about russia 's liberal opposition ?
none of russia 's liberal opposition parties has a candidate in the race .
one opposition leader , former prime minister mikhail kasyanov , was barred from standing after the electoral authorities said signatures collected in his support had been forged .
liberal opposition candidate mikhail kasyanov was barred from standing mr kasyanov described the move as " purely political " , while the central electoral commission insisted it had acted in accordance with the law .
another opposition leader , boris nemtsov , withdrew , saying the election 's outcome had been predetermined .
he had not got to the point of being registered as a candidate .
will the election be free and fair ?
the observer group of the organisation for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- described russia 's last nationwide vote - the parliamentary election in december 2007 - as neither free nor fair .
in the run-up to these elections , opposition candidates complained that state-owned national television stations devoted an overwhelming amount of coverage to dmitry medvedev .
are international observers there ?
yes - but only about 300 international observers for some 96,000 polling stations .
the process was overshadowed by the osce 's decision to boycott the election ; the organisation said that restrictions imposed by russia on its monitors would have made it impossible to do their job .
russia reacted angrily to the move , accusing the osce of making " ultimatums " .
what will mr putin 's role be after the election ?
this has been the subject of intense speculation ; mr putin at least partly dispelled some of the mystery by accepting an offer to become prime minister if mr medvedev is elected .
some observers believe mr medvedev 's candidacy is merely a way for mr putin to maintain influence after formally stepping down , and that the outgoing president will - as prime minister - continue to call the shots .

the government has declared a state of emergency and troops and armoured cars are patrolling the centre of yerevan .
tv pictures showed burnt-out cars and smashed shop windows in the city .
there have been 11 days of protests over the 19 february presidential vote which gave a convincing win to prime minister serzh sarkisian .

the government has declared a state of emergency and troops and armoured cars are patrolling the centre of yerevan .
tv pictures showed burnt-out cars and smashed shop windows in the city .
there have been 11 days of protests over the 19 february presidential vote which gave a convincing win to prime minister serzh sarkisian .
appeals for calm outgoing president robert kocharian declared the state of emergency late on saturday after police used tear gas and fired shots in the air to break up a crowd of thousands of opposition demonstrators .
the shooting was constant and very heavy for more than an hour lori , a yerevan resident eyewitnesses : yerevan unrest troops patrol bruised city a police spokesman said that eight people were killed and 33 police officers injured in the clashes .
he said several officers had been injured by gunfire .
by sunday morning , calm had returned to yerevan , with the city centre under tight security .
opposition presidential candidate levon ter-petrosian has said he was under house arrest but recorded an appeal for his supporters to leave the streets .
the government has said mr ter-petrosian is not being prevented from leaving his home .
the state of emergency declared by outgoing president robert kocharian bans public gatherings and imposes restrictions on media reports and is to remain in force until 20 march .
as he announced the emergency state , he appealed " to the people of armenia to show restraint and understanding " .
official results gave mr sarkisian 53 % of the vote , with mr ter-petrosian , a former president , getting 21.5 % .
international observers judged the election in the ex-soviet caucasus republic to be generally democratic .
but the opposition says the poll was rigged in favour of mr sarkisian , a close ally of mr kocharian , who is barred constitutionally from seeking a third term in office .
correspondents say the unrest has risked destabilising a key russian ally which lies between the energy-rich caspian sea and the markets of europe .
the clashes broke out after security forces cleared an opposition protest camp from a city centre square on saturday morning .
protesters reassembled nearby and later in the day there were pitched battles between security forces and protesters .
demonstrators hurled stones and petrol bombs , setting vehicles on fire , and police and troops responded with truncheons , tear gas and by firing bullets in the air .

in friday 's $ 1bn -lrb- £ 500m -rrb- deal , renault acquired a 25 % stake in the company .
the deal will elevate the renault-nissan-avtovaz alliance to the number three slot globally after general motors and toyota , and as such it is a timely industrial partnership coming just ahead of the presidential election in the country .
" renault and nissan will accelerate the rejuvenation of the lada brand in russia , rather than using their new partner as a launch-pad for their own products , " says global insight automotive analyst paul newton .
" it is hoped that lada 's obvious need for new products , technology , and production techniques will result in a positive relationship . "
avtovaz hopes to more than double sales to more than 1.5 million cars by 2015 .
the alliance will " preserve and protect the lada trademark " , which should be a " people 's automobile " , according to sergei chemezov , head of the state holding company rostekhnologia , which owns the remaining 75 % of the avtovaz shares .
rostekhnologia aims to sell a second 25 % stake later this year to stock market investors .
booming market avtovaz used to account for 70 % of russia 's car production - but not anymore .
renault 's cash and technology injection is just the latest in a string of billion-dollar investments by global automotive giants desperate to enter russia 's booming car market .
the changes are visible in russia 's streets .

renault and nissan will accelerate the rejuvenation of the lada brand in russia , rather than using their new partner as a launch-pad for their own product " global insight automotive analyst paul newton last year , the russian car market grew 34 % , according to pricewaterhousecoopers , far outpacing both china and india .
by the end of next year , russia will have overtaken germany to become the biggest car market in europe , a fact that paul willis , chief operating officer of kia motors europe , describes as " the most startling statistics i have heard in my whole career " .
for six asian carmakers , russia has already become their number one market in europe , according to automotive news europe .
toyota , nissan , kia , lexus , ssangyong and subaru already sell more cars in russia than in any other country in europe .
mazda and suzuki could be next , and chinese carmakers are also making hay while the sun shines , the paper says .
local decline in many parts of russia , multi-marquee showrooms are commonplace .
dealers stock broad ranges of brands , and it is evident that foreign ones are taking over .
last year , sales of non-russian car marques rose 65 % to 1.65 million units , about two-thirds of the cars sold in russia .
consequently , the non-russian brands pushed the market share of russian brands down to 32 % , from 44 % in 2006 .
however , the renault deal should go some way to reverse this decline in sales of locally badged cars .
" with the russian market in boom phase , renault-nissan-avtovaz can not move fast enough in its attempts to breathe new life into the lada brand , " says mr newton .
russia 's other leading carmakers , severstal-auto and gaz also have foreign partners .
severstal is working with fiat , ssangyong and isuzu , whilst gaz is working with magna , the canadian parts supplier .
new factories but russia is not just a huge market enjoying explosive growth .
companies such as general motors , ford , toyota and suzuki , to name but a few , are desperate to produce where costs are low and demand is soaring , so between them they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in brand new high-capacity factories in st petersburg .
as a result , russia is quickly becoming europe 's biggest car producer , with st petersburg emerging as russia 's , perhaps even europe 's , version of what detroit used to be for the us .
and russia 's indigenous carmakers are quickly learning the ropes .
" we can not ignore russia , " insists carlos ghosn - who is chief executive of both renault and nissan , and thus fast becoming the industry 's third-most powerful leader .
" russia is probably one of the most coveted markets . "
and although they are bitter rivals , the world 's automotive executives tend to agree .

companies such as general motors , ford , toyota and suzuki , to name but a few , are desperate to produce where costs are low and demand is soaring , so between them they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in brand new high-capacity factories in st petersburg .
as a result , russia is quickly becoming europe 's biggest car producer , with st petersburg emerging as russia 's , perhaps even europe 's , version of what detroit used to be for the us .
and russia 's indigenous carmakers are quickly learning the ropes .
" we can not ignore russia , " insists carlos ghosn - who is chief executive of both renault and nissan , and thus fast becoming the industry 's third-most powerful leader .
" russia is probably one of the most coveted markets . "
and although they are bitter rivals , the world 's automotive executives tend to agree .

general sir richard dannatt said there was no " immediate prospect " of him going " anywhere else " after returning from the country on saturday .
it is a blow to the prince , who does not " want to sit around windsor " .
but sir richard stopped short of saying prince william would not follow in his brother 's footsteps and be deployed .
his predecessor , general sir mike jackson , told bbc1 's andrew marr show any future deployment of prince harry would have to ensure it did not put anybody else at greater risk , but added : " i would n't rule it out at all . "
" as prince harry said , he now has a campaign medal .
i wonder if it will the first and only one .
somehow i doubt that . "
but he conceded that sending prince william on active operations would be " rather more difficult " given his status as heir to the throne .
taskforce request prince harry returned to the uk on saturday after a news leak cut short his front-line deployment .
he was 10 weeks into a tour on the front line in helmand province .
when harry 's cover was blown and a news blackout on his presence lifted last week , he voiced hopes that he could return .
the prince said he had asked his commanding officer for permission to join 16 air assault brigade - the taskforce due to take over the helmand mission in the spring - for the last two months of their deployment .
the prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future general sir richard dannatt sir richard , chief of the army 's general staff , said : " as an enthusiastic young officer i would expect him to want to do that .
but he added : " he 's just had a deployment , we would n't expect to send any young officer in the normal course of events who has just had - albeit 10 weeks and that quite quickly - for another tour .
" so actually the immediate prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future . "
he said harry had regimental commitments , and added : " it actually is hypothetical for the next 12 to 18 months whether he would or would n't deploy again . "
of a potential deployment for prince william , he said : " a completely separate issue ... -lrb- that -rrb- must be looked at again on a case-by-case basis . "
" red-blooded " man during his mission , harry spent time living and working just 500m from the taleban front line at garmsir and was on manoeuvres in the desert around their former stronghold of musa qaleh .
prince harry was on patrol in garmsir near the front line sir richard said there had been a risk assessment from the start .
" there is a risk where all our servicemen and women deploy in afghanistan , but the nature of the operations and the locations he would be in is exactly the sort of risk that we would expect a young officer to be exposed to .
" there 's no reason why he should n't do that . "
while he had not spoken to the " red-blooded young man " since the decision to bring him back , he said harry would be " disappointed " but " understanding " .
' very good job ' and he said the prince 's deployment had been invaluable in trying to explain to the british public the army 's mission in afghanistan .
the final decision to withdraw harry immediately was taken by air chief marshal sir jock stirrup , chief of the defence staff .
" he has done so far a very good job in his army career .
of course it can never be like some ordinary person 's career , " he told sky news .
" but so far he has been able to have as close to a normal career as i think anyone in such circumstances every could have . "
sir jock said he understood media " nerves " about agreeing a news blackout , but insisted its ability to report the " fundamentals " of the operation was never compromised .
" we are talking about the deployment of one individual , i really ca n't see that as an issue of principle of terms of media reporting . "
his comments come after senior broadcaster jon snow questioned the british media 's willingness to agree the blackout .

general sir richard dannatt said there was no " immediate prospect " of him going " anywhere else " after returning from the country on saturday .
it is a blow to the prince , who does not " want to sit around windsor " .
but sir richard stopped short of saying prince william would not follow in his brother 's footsteps and be deployed .
his predecessor , general sir mike jackson , told bbc1 's andrew marr show any future deployment of prince harry would have to ensure it did not put anybody else at greater risk , but added : " i would n't rule it out at all . "

he was 10 weeks into a tour on the front line in helmand province .
when harry 's cover was blown and a news blackout on his presence lifted last week , he voiced hopes that he could return .
the prince said he had asked his commanding officer for permission to join 16 air assault brigade - the taskforce due to take over the helmand mission in the spring - for the last two months of their deployment .
the prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future general sir richard dannatt sir richard , chief of the army 's general staff , said : " as an enthusiastic young officer i would expect him to want to do that .

" so actually the immediate prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future . "
he said harry had regimental commitments , and added : " it actually is hypothetical for the next 12 to 18 months whether he would or would n't deploy again . "
of a potential deployment for prince william , he said : " a completely separate issue ... -lrb- that -rrb- must be looked at again on a case-by-case basis . "
" red-blooded " man during his mission , harry spent time living and working just 500m from the taleban front line at garmsir and was on manoeuvres in the desert around their former stronghold of musa qaleh .

" there is a risk where all our servicemen and women deploy in afghanistan , but the nature of the operations and the locations he would be in is exactly the sort of risk that we would expect a young officer to be exposed to .
" there 's no reason why he should n't do that . "
while he had not spoken to the " red-blooded young man " since the decision to bring him back , he said harry would be " disappointed " but " understanding " .

general sir richard dannatt said there was no " immediate prospect " of him going " anywhere else " after returning from the country on saturday .
it is a blow to the prince , who does not " want to sit around windsor " .
but sir richard stopped short of saying prince william would not follow in his brother 's footsteps and be deployed .
his predecessor , general sir mike jackson , told bbc1 's andrew marr show any future deployment of prince harry would have to ensure it did not put anybody else at greater risk , but added : " i would n't rule it out at all . "

he was 10 weeks into a tour on the front line in helmand province .
when harry 's cover was blown and a news blackout on his presence lifted last week , he voiced hopes that he could return .
the prince said he had asked his commanding officer for permission to join 16 air assault brigade - the taskforce due to take over the helmand mission in the spring - for the last two months of their deployment .
the prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future general sir richard dannatt sir richard , chief of the army 's general staff , said : " as an enthusiastic young officer i would expect him to want to do that .
but he added : " he 's just had a deployment , we would n't expect to send any young officer in the normal course of events who has just had - albeit 10 weeks and that quite quickly - for another tour .
" so actually the immediate prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future . "
he said harry had regimental commitments , and added : " it actually is hypothetical for the next 12 to 18 months whether he would or would n't deploy again . "
of a potential deployment for prince william , he said : " a completely separate issue ... -lrb- that -rrb- must be looked at again on a case-by-case basis . "
" red-blooded " man during his mission , harry spent time living and working just 500m from the taleban front line at garmsir and was on manoeuvres in the desert around their former stronghold of musa qaleh .
prince harry was on patrol in garmsir near the front line sir richard said there had been a risk assessment from the start .
" there is a risk where all our servicemen and women deploy in afghanistan , but the nature of the operations and the locations he would be in is exactly the sort of risk that we would expect a young officer to be exposed to .
" there 's no reason why he should n't do that . "
while he had not spoken to the " red-blooded young man " since the decision to bring him back , he said harry would be " disappointed " but " understanding " .
' very good job ' and he said the prince 's deployment had been invaluable in trying to explain to the british public the army 's mission in afghanistan .

" he has done so far a very good job in his army career .

sir jock said he understood media " nerves " about agreeing a news blackout , but insisted its ability to report the " fundamentals " of the operation was never compromised .

general sir richard dannatt said there was no " immediate prospect " of him going " anywhere else " after returning from the country on saturday .
it is a blow to the prince , who does not " want to sit around windsor " .
but sir richard stopped short of saying prince william would not follow in his brother 's footsteps and be deployed .
his predecessor , general sir mike jackson , told bbc1 's andrew marr show any future deployment of prince harry would have to ensure it did not put anybody else at greater risk , but added : " i would n't rule it out at all . "
" as prince harry said , he now has a campaign medal .
i wonder if it will the first and only one .
somehow i doubt that . "
but he conceded that sending prince william on active operations would be " rather more difficult " given his status as heir to the throne .
taskforce request prince harry returned to the uk on saturday after a news leak cut short his front-line deployment .
he was 10 weeks into a tour on the front line in helmand province .
when harry 's cover was blown and a news blackout on his presence lifted last week , he voiced hopes that he could return .
the prince said he had asked his commanding officer for permission to join 16 air assault brigade - the taskforce due to take over the helmand mission in the spring - for the last two months of their deployment . "
the prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future " general sir richard dannatt sir richard , chief of the army 's general staff , said : " as an enthusiastic young officer i would expect him to want to do that .
but he added : " he 's just had a deployment , we would n't expect to send any young officer in the normal course of events who has just had - albeit 10 weeks and that quite quickly - for another tour .
" so actually the immediate prospect of prince harry going anywhere else is some way off in the future . "
he said harry had regimental commitments , and added : " it actually is hypothetical for the next 12 to 18 months whether he would or would n't deploy again . "
of a potential deployment for prince william , he said : " a completely separate issue ... -lrb- that -rrb- must be looked at again on a case-by-case basis . "
" red-blooded " man during his mission , harry spent time living and working just 500m from the taleban front line at garmsir and was on manoeuvres in the desert around their former stronghold of musa qaleh .
sir richard said there had been a risk assessment from the start .
" there is a risk where all our servicemen and women deploy in afghanistan , but the nature of the operations and the locations he would be in is exactly the sort of risk that we would expect a young officer to be exposed to .
" there 's no reason why he should n't do that . "
while he had not spoken to the " red-blooded young man " since the decision to bring him back , he said harry would be " disappointed " but " understanding " .
' very good job ' and he said the prince 's deployment had been invaluable in trying to explain to the british public the army 's mission in afghanistan .
the final decision to withdraw harry immediately was taken by air chief marshal sir jock stirrup , chief of the defence staff .
" he has done so far a very good job in his army career .
of course it can never be like some ordinary person 's career , " he told sky news .
" but so far he has been able to have as close to a normal career as i think anyone in such circumstances every could have . "
sir jock said he understood media " nerves " about agreeing a news blackout , but insisted its ability to report the " fundamentals " of the operation was never compromised .
" we are talking about the deployment of one individual , i really ca n't see that as an issue of principle of terms of media reporting . "
his comments come after senior broadcaster jon snow questioned the british media 's willingness to agree the blackout .
