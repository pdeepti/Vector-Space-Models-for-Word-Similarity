ribery received 224 votes to 115 for chelsea midfielder ballack and 108 for bayern munich 's italy striker luca toni .
bayern 's philipp lahm and former skipper oliver kahn finished fourth and fifth in the poll , kicker said wednesday .
both ribery and toni were playing in their first season in the bundesliga , helping bayern to a league and cup double .
" it 's good for a sportsman to be recognized for his performances .
but i have to say that the titles won last year by the team are far more important , " the frenchman told yahoo sport .
it was a second major award for 25-year-old ribery who joined bayern from marseille last year and who had already been voted france 's player of the year for 2007 .
german bundesliga players also chose him as their player of the year in a poll conducted by kicker towards the end of last season .
“ we 're delighted and proud that franck ribery has been voted 2008 soccer player of the year by an overwhelming majority .
the accolade is thoroughly deserved , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told the club 's web site .
ex-bayern hands win coaching accolades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland coach ottmar hitzfeld ottmar hitzfeld , who left bayern at the end of last season to take over as switzerland coach , was voted coach of the year .
hitzfeld received 264 votes , with former bayern coach felix magath , now with wolfsburg , garnering 131 .
the female footballer of the year award went for an eighth successive time to striker birgit prinz of ffc frankfurt .
the kicker poll , eligible for any soccer player in germany , or any german soccer player playing abroad , has been awarded since 1960 .
ribery , currently injured , is only the second non-german to win the award following the brazilian ailton , then of werder bremen , in 2004 .
bayern will be hoping to back up their performance last season with a good showing in the upcoming champions league under new coach juergen klinsmann . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .

" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .
at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .
georgian television showed images of corpses sprawled along sidewalks and streets , in some cases still holding luggage . who is in control ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from both sides are moving in on south ossetia control of tskhinvali appeared disputed on saturday , with georgian officials asserting total control of the city , and russian officials claiming that they had taken the city . refugees were leaving the region and heading north towards the russian border throughout the night , at times under georgian artillery fire . georgian forces late on friday ceased fire for some three hours to allow civilians to leave , but according to russian observers georgian shelling interdicted roads leading north throughout the night . georgia pulls troops from iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian has also mobilized its reserves georgia will reportedly withdraw its entire iraqi contingent of 2,000 soldiers and bring them home as soon as possible as the country is engaged in fierce fighting with russia over breakaway province south ossetia . the commander of the georgian contingent in iraq said that the full brigade would go home as soon as possible .

" we are all sorry for what has happened , " wang wei , the executive vice-president of the olympic organizing committee bocog , told a news conference .
" we believe all issues can be resolved by dialogue . " international olympic committee spokeswoman giselle davies said : " conflict is not what we want to see .
it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for . " the fighting in southern ossetia , a breakaway enclave of georgia , erupted at the same time as the beijing olympics opened in the presence of georgian and russian athletes and with russian premier vladimir putin among the spectators in beijing 's national stadium . sad precedence it came despite a call from the united nations to respect the olympics truce and for warring parties to cease all hostilities worldwide during the games .
it was the first time that a conflict began on the opening day of an olympics . " the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for , " said davies , but added that it had to be implemented by the un .
" it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict . " davies said it was not appropriate for the ioc to comment on the fact that the 2014 winter games ' host city of sochi was close to south ossetia . " it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games , " she said . davies also said that the conflict , and politics in general , was not discussed when ioc president jacques rogge met with putin on friday . china calls for ceasefire olympic host china meanwhile joined many other countries saturday in urging both sides to seek dialogue . " the chinese side expresses its solemn concern over the escalation of tensions and armed clashes in south ossetia , " foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said in a statement .

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .

he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .

that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .
but the real reason is something different : georgia wants to enter nato and the european union .

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as far as saakashvili is concerned , russia 's involvement in south ossetia amounts to a declaration of war against georgia and the involvement in the internal affairs of a neighboring state - not without hope for western , especially american support against the alleged russian aggressor . humanitarian intervention or russian imperialism ? in a similarly mixed-up way , russia is trying to justify its policies .
in line with western arguments during the nato mission against serbia to protect kosovo , russian officials are now presenting the military intervention as a " humanitarian " one : moscow needs to save " russian lives " and strengthen the so-called russian peacekeepers . this could help to justify air attacks against georgian cities and infrastructure - just like nato did in serbia .
in case of a successful military mission in south ossetia , a future independence and subsequent russian incorporation of south ossetia could be justified - true to the western scenario in kosovo .

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .

with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as far as saakashvili is concerned , russia 's involvement in south ossetia amounts to a declaration of war against georgia and the involvement in the internal affairs of a neighboring state - not without hope for western , especially american support against the alleged russian aggressor . humanitarian intervention or russian imperialism ? in a similarly mixed-up way , russia is trying to justify its policies .
in line with western arguments during the nato mission against serbia to protect kosovo , russian officials are now presenting the military intervention as a " humanitarian " one : moscow needs to save " russian lives " and strengthen the so-called russian peacekeepers . this could help to justify air attacks against georgian cities and infrastructure - just like nato did in serbia .
in case of a successful military mission in south ossetia , a future independence and subsequent russian incorporation of south ossetia could be justified - true to the western scenario in kosovo .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south ossetian home is destroyed by a georgian strike .
" a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing , " he added as he accused georgia of " gross violations of humanitarian law , " including reports of ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilians . georgian ambassador irakli alasania rejected churkin 's charges , telling the 15-nation council that tbilisi was merely defending itself against russian aggression .
he said russia was bombing civilian targets and infrastructure in georgia . " georgian troops are not targeting peacekeepers , " he said .
turning directly to churkin , he asked , " are you ready to stop the bombers in the air ? " demands for russia withdrawal asked about reports that russian fighter jets bombed a container tank and civilian infrastructure in the georgian port of poti , churkin said : " i do n't have this information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fighter jet drops munitions near the georgian town of gori .
alasania demanded the russian federation " immediately terminate aerial bombardments , immediately pull out the occupying forces , and negotiate cease-fire . "
he said president mikheil saakashvili was ready for direct peace talks with the russians . but churkin made clear that russia would never abandon the region .
" historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of the security of the people of the caucuses , " he said . un fails to call for ceasefire in its second emergency meeting on the south ossetia crisis within 12 hours , the un on friday failed to produce the much hoped for statement calling for an immediate truce . at georgia 's request , the 15-member council convened for its second emergency meeting on the crisis within 12 hours to try to defuse the mounting tension .
but the council could not agree on the language for a statement calling for a ceasefire . bildunterschrift : map of georgia and its enclaves south ossetia and abkhazia belgian ambassador jan grauls , who holds the council 's rotating presidency , said council members were unable to reach an agreement on the wording of an appeal and would likely meet again on saturday with the aim of issuing a statement backed by all 15 member states . " some members of the council need more time ... this negotiation has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " grauls told reporters as he emerged from hours of closed-door consultations . " the expectation around the world is for a ceasefire , for an end to use of -lrb- russian -rrb- aerial bombing , missile attacks , use of combat forces , " us ambassador zalmay khalilzad told reporters .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .

russia can destroy it , but it will be neither quick nor easy , regional observers say .
us special forces troops , and later us marines replacing them , have for the last half decade been systematically training selected georgian units to nato standards .
gone are the soviet traditions of soldiers ' never firing their weapons until the war breaks out , or tanks too valuable to drive out of the motor pool .
using standard training plans familiar to the average us army or marine recruit , the us educators have focused on basics : teaching georgian soldiers small unit tactics , marksmanship , and individual initiative .
the us trainers also took the georgian officer corps to school , pushing lessons and buzz words learned by america in its recent wars .
among these , are making the air force and army work together -lrb- inter-service cooperation -rrb- , trying to surprise the opponent and possess lots of information about him -lrb- the information battle -rrb- , getting beans and bullets to the troops -lrb- logistics -rrb- , and enforcing the bog-standard rule that good officers lead from the front .
best-paid jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikheil saakashvili has invested heavily in his country 's military saakashvili has fully backed up the american trainers : in high-unemployment georgia , the best-paid job available to an active young georgian man is within the ranks of the military .
today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .
returning home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a much larger army at its disposal georgia 's government on saturday called on those desert-hardened veterans , requesting the pentagon release the elite 13th battalion to return home from the middle east , to fight russians in ossetia .
saakashvili 's defense ministry , according to officials in tbilisi , spends some $ 930 million -lrb- 620 million euros -rrb- a year on its military , a drop in the bucket compared to russia , but a massive spike from $ 30 million spent in 1991 when georgia became independent .
perhaps tellingly , a lion 's share of georgia 's defense budget has gone to field training and soldier personal kit .
first-line georgian soldiers wear nato uniforms , kevlar helmets and body armour matching us issue , and carry the us-manufactured m-16 automatic rifle - a dramatic turn away from the way most former soviet republics outfit troops , with a mix of soviet-era hand-me-downs and more recent russian or chinese gear .
georgia has , however , not thrown out every last kalashnikov , and most of georgia 's reserves and second-line troops are not as well equipped , and trained marginally , similar to russian reserves that might be sent to the region .
big ticket items but georgia at the same time has according to military observers spent its limited money on a few well-chosen big ticket items : modern czech self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers -lrb- of which some now are bombarding tskhinvali -rrb- , turkish armored cars , and even a french missile boat .
the infantry force the georgians have fielded in ossetia , as a result , is by most accounts at least as competent as russian army elements opposing it , and by some standards -lrb- combat experience and field training -rrb- possibly even superior , observers said .
russia as a regional power , however , enjoys overall superiority over the georgians , in the short term with a much stronger air force , and in the longer term with the kremlin 's potential ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and conquer georgia - provided the kremlin has the will to take the losses needed to eliminate their doughty opponents .
a second and probably more critical question is , therefore , whether it is saakashvili or the kremlin that is more willing to spend soldier lives in what by all accounts promises to be more bloody fighting . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south ossetian home is destroyed by a georgian strike .
" a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing , " he added as he accused georgia of " gross violations of humanitarian law , " including reports of ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilians . georgian ambassador irakli alasania rejected churkin 's charges , telling the 15-nation council that tbilisi was merely defending itself against russian aggression .
he said russia was bombing civilian targets and infrastructure in georgia . " georgian troops are not targeting peacekeepers , " he said .
turning directly to churkin , he asked , " are you ready to stop the bombers in the air ? " demands for russia withdrawal asked about reports that russian fighter jets bombed a container tank and civilian infrastructure in the georgian port of poti , churkin said : " i do n't have this information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fighter jet drops munitions near the georgian town of gori .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south ossetian home is destroyed by a georgian strike .
" a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing , " he added as he accused georgia of " gross violations of humanitarian law , " including reports of ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilians . georgian ambassador irakli alasania rejected churkin 's charges , telling the 15-nation council that tbilisi was merely defending itself against russian aggression .
he said russia was bombing civilian targets and infrastructure in georgia . " georgian troops are not targeting peacekeepers , " he said .
turning directly to churkin , he asked , " are you ready to stop the bombers in the air ? " demands for russia withdrawal asked about reports that russian fighter jets bombed a container tank and civilian infrastructure in the georgian port of poti , churkin said : " i do n't have this information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fighter jet drops munitions near the georgian town of gori .

" some members of the council need more time ... this negotiation has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " grauls told reporters as he emerged from hours of closed-door consultations . " the expectation around the world is for a ceasefire , for an end to use of -lrb- russian -rrb- aerial bombing , missile attacks , use of combat forces , " us ambassador zalmay khalilzad told reporters .
" the time has come to cease these attacks .

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .
the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .
i just hope there are no deaths among the peaceful population in south ossetia . how can a war between russia and georgia be averted ? the only sensible step would be to end all the fighting and no matter what prevent the military escalation .
that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .
but the real reason is something different : georgia wants to enter nato and the european union .
russia will not allow georgia - a former member of the soviet union - to join these organizations and can not accept georgia 's pro-western aspirations . interview : dirk eckert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fighting in southern ossetia , a breakaway enclave of georgia , erupted at the same time as the beijing olympics opened in the presence of georgian and russian athletes and with russian premier vladimir putin among the spectators in beijing 's national stadium . sad precedence it came despite a call from the united nations to respect the olympics truce and for warring parties to cease all hostilities worldwide during the games .
it was the first time that a conflict began on the opening day of an olympics . " the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for , " said davies , but added that it had to be implemented by the un .
" it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict . " davies said it was not appropriate for the ioc to comment on the fact that the 2014 winter games ' host city of sochi was close to south ossetia . " it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games , " she said . davies also said that the conflict , and politics in general , was not discussed when ioc president jacques rogge met with putin on friday . china calls for ceasefire olympic host china meanwhile joined many other countries saturday in urging both sides to seek dialogue .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .
at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.08.2008 hollywood helps revive berlin 's former movie glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " metropolis " was filmed in babelsberg in 1927 star-studded movie productions with hollywood a-list actors and a bit of financial support from the german government are returning a film studio near berlin to its long-lost glitz . almost two decades after a popular uprising swept away the communist east german state , berlin 's film movie business is enjoying something of a renaissance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino 's been spotted around berlin us director quentin tarantino jetted into the german capital this month to begin laying the ground for the shooting of a new film set between the two world wars .
with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de release of tom cruise 's world war ii epic delayed a movie in which tom cruise plays a true-life german world war ii hero will not reach screens until february 2009 , the producers said as germans were getting ready to mark the 64th anniversary of the anti-hitler plot .
-lrb- 20.07.2008 -rrb- film subsidies draw big names to german studios a new state subsidy model has made germany an attractive place to make movies .
wooed by the public funding , both illustrious hollywood movie producers and industry newcomers are setting up their cameras in germany .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west .

russia can destroy it , but it will be neither quick nor easy , regional observers say .
us special forces troops , and later us marines replacing them , have for the last half decade been systematically training selected georgian units to nato standards .
gone are the soviet traditions of soldiers ' never firing their weapons until the war breaks out , or tanks too valuable to drive out of the motor pool .

among these , are making the air force and army work together -lrb- inter-service cooperation -rrb- , trying to surprise the opponent and possess lots of information about him -lrb- the information battle -rrb- , getting beans and bullets to the troops -lrb- logistics -rrb- , and enforcing the bog-standard rule that good officers lead from the front .
best-paid jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikheil saakashvili has invested heavily in his country 's military saakashvili has fully backed up the american trainers : in high-unemployment georgia , the best-paid job available to an active young georgian man is within the ranks of the military .
today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .
returning home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a much larger army at its disposal georgia 's government on saturday called on those desert-hardened veterans , requesting the pentagon release the elite 13th battalion to return home from the middle east , to fight russians in ossetia .
saakashvili 's defense ministry , according to officials in tbilisi , spends some $ 930 million -lrb- 620 million euros -rrb- a year on its military , a drop in the bucket compared to russia , but a massive spike from $ 30 million spent in 1991 when georgia became independent .
perhaps tellingly , a lion 's share of georgia 's defense budget has gone to field training and soldier personal kit .
first-line georgian soldiers wear nato uniforms , kevlar helmets and body armour matching us issue , and carry the us-manufactured m-16 automatic rifle - a dramatic turn away from the way most former soviet republics outfit troops , with a mix of soviet-era hand-me-downs and more recent russian or chinese gear .
georgia has , however , not thrown out every last kalashnikov , and most of georgia 's reserves and second-line troops are not as well equipped , and trained marginally , similar to russian reserves that might be sent to the region .
big ticket items but georgia at the same time has according to military observers spent its limited money on a few well-chosen big ticket items : modern czech self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers -lrb- of which some now are bombarding tskhinvali -rrb- , turkish armored cars , and even a french missile boat .
the infantry force the georgians have fielded in ossetia , as a result , is by most accounts at least as competent as russian army elements opposing it , and by some standards -lrb- combat experience and field training -rrb- possibly even superior , observers said .
russia as a regional power , however , enjoys overall superiority over the georgians , in the short term with a much stronger air force , and in the longer term with the kremlin 's potential ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and conquer georgia - provided the kremlin has the will to take the losses needed to eliminate their doughty opponents .
a second and probably more critical question is , therefore , whether it is saakashvili or the kremlin that is more willing to spend soldier lives in what by all accounts promises to be more bloody fighting . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .

he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .
the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .
i just hope there are no deaths among the peaceful population in south ossetia . how can a war between russia and georgia be averted ? the only sensible step would be to end all the fighting and no matter what prevent the military escalation .
that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .
but the real reason is something different : georgia wants to enter nato and the european union .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .

russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion .

" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .

as far as saakashvili is concerned , russia 's involvement in south ossetia amounts to a declaration of war against georgia and the involvement in the internal affairs of a neighboring state - not without hope for western , especially american support against the alleged russian aggressor . humanitarian intervention or russian imperialism ? in a similarly mixed-up way , russia is trying to justify its policies .
in line with western arguments during the nato mission against serbia to protect kosovo , russian officials are now presenting the military intervention as a " humanitarian " one : moscow needs to save " russian lives " and strengthen the so-called russian peacekeepers . this could help to justify air attacks against georgian cities and infrastructure - just like nato did in serbia .
in case of a successful military mission in south ossetia , a future independence and subsequent russian incorporation of south ossetia could be justified - true to the western scenario in kosovo .
keeping in mind the highly patriotic mood in russia , this development would also get the support of large parts of the russian society , which is still traumatized by the disintegration of the soviet union . ruso-western alientation it 's hard to predict the military outcome and any future political developments right now .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia .

will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "

and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fighting in southern ossetia , a breakaway enclave of georgia , erupted at the same time as the beijing olympics opened in the presence of georgian and russian athletes and with russian premier vladimir putin among the spectators in beijing 's national stadium . sad precedence it came despite a call from the united nations to respect the olympics truce and for warring parties to cease all hostilities worldwide during the games .
it was the first time that a conflict began on the opening day of an olympics . " the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for , " said davies , but added that it had to be implemented by the un .
" it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict . " davies said it was not appropriate for the ioc to comment on the fact that the 2014 winter games ' host city of sochi was close to south ossetia . " it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games , " she said . davies also said that the conflict , and politics in general , was not discussed when ioc president jacques rogge met with putin on friday . china calls for ceasefire olympic host china meanwhile joined many other countries saturday in urging both sides to seek dialogue .

" we believe all issues can be resolved by dialogue . " international olympic committee spokeswoman giselle davies said : " conflict is not what we want to see .
it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for . " the fighting in southern ossetia , a breakaway enclave of georgia , erupted at the same time as the beijing olympics opened in the presence of georgian and russian athletes and with russian premier vladimir putin among the spectators in beijing 's national stadium . sad precedence it came despite a call from the united nations to respect the olympics truce and for warring parties to cease all hostilities worldwide during the games .
it was the first time that a conflict began on the opening day of an olympics . " the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for , " said davies , but added that it had to be implemented by the un .
" it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict . " davies said it was not appropriate for the ioc to comment on the fact that the 2014 winter games ' host city of sochi was close to south ossetia . " it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games , " she said . davies also said that the conflict , and politics in general , was not discussed when ioc president jacques rogge met with putin on friday . china calls for ceasefire olympic host china meanwhile joined many other countries saturday in urging both sides to seek dialogue .

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .
the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .
i just hope there are no deaths among the peaceful population in south ossetia . how can a war between russia and georgia be averted ? the only sensible step would be to end all the fighting and no matter what prevent the military escalation .
that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .
but the real reason is something different : georgia wants to enter nato and the european union .
russia will not allow georgia - a former member of the soviet union - to join these organizations and can not accept georgia 's pro-western aspirations . interview : dirk eckert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials have denied russian casualty figures , claiming they were blown out of proportion .
georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian city of tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses . eyewitnesses said many tskhinvali victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .

the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .
i just hope there are no deaths among the peaceful population in south ossetia . how can a war between russia and georgia be averted ? the only sensible step would be to end all the fighting and no matter what prevent the military escalation .
that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .
but the real reason is something different : georgia wants to enter nato and the european union .
russia will not allow georgia - a former member of the soviet union - to join these organizations and can not accept georgia 's pro-western aspirations . interview : dirk eckert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .

"
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately .

" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south ossetian home is destroyed by a georgian strike .
" a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing , " he added as he accused georgia of " gross violations of humanitarian law , " including reports of ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilians . georgian ambassador irakli alasania rejected churkin 's charges , telling the 15-nation council that tbilisi was merely defending itself against russian aggression .
he said russia was bombing civilian targets and infrastructure in georgia . " georgian troops are not targeting peacekeepers , " he said .
turning directly to churkin , he asked , " are you ready to stop the bombers in the air ? " demands for russia withdrawal asked about reports that russian fighter jets bombed a container tank and civilian infrastructure in the georgian port of poti , churkin said : " i do n't have this information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fighter jet drops munitions near the georgian town of gori .
alasania demanded the russian federation " immediately terminate aerial bombardments , immediately pull out the occupying forces , and negotiate cease-fire . "
he said president mikheil saakashvili was ready for direct peace talks with the russians . but churkin made clear that russia would never abandon the region .
" historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of the security of the people of the caucuses , " he said . un fails to call for ceasefire in its second emergency meeting on the south ossetia crisis within 12 hours , the un on friday failed to produce the much hoped for statement calling for an immediate truce . at georgia 's request , the 15-member council convened for its second emergency meeting on the crisis within 12 hours to try to defuse the mounting tension .
but the council could not agree on the language for a statement calling for a ceasefire . bildunterschrift : map of georgia and its enclaves south ossetia and abkhazia belgian ambassador jan grauls , who holds the council 's rotating presidency , said council members were unable to reach an agreement on the wording of an appeal and would likely meet again on saturday with the aim of issuing a statement backed by all 15 member states . " some members of the council need more time ... this negotiation has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow -lrb- saturday -rrb- , " grauls told reporters as he emerged from hours of closed-door consultations . " the expectation around the world is for a ceasefire , for an end to use of -lrb- russian -rrb- aerial bombing , missile attacks , use of combat forces , " us ambassador zalmay khalilzad told reporters .
" the time has come to cease these attacks . " diplomats said a belgian-drafted compromise statement also urges the warring sides to " show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force , " calls for respect by the parties of past accords and for the provision of humanitarian aid to the victims . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west .

the information war , however , has also reached a new level of escalation , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . there 's no doubt that georgia 's military intervention in south ossetia has lead to a war between georgia and russia .
while the military situation is still hard to grasp , georgia and russia - the latter being south ossetia 's traditional protecting power - have also begun a media and information war .
it wo n't make it easier to reach a political solution to the conflict .
most likely , the conflict will even broaden the estrangement between russia and the west . georgia - victim or aggressor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel georgian president saakashvili is presenting his military actions against the south ossetian regime as righteous ones .
from a legal point of view , he 's not wrong .
the republic of south ossetia , which is not recognized internationally , formally belongs to the georgian state even if tbilisi has lost factual control there for the past 15 years and almost all residents have russian passports . interestingly enough , saakashvili uses the same words to describe the military operation in south ossetia that russia used to justify its intervention in chechnya : " restoring the constutional order " in georgia .
as far as saakashvili is concerned , russia 's involvement in south ossetia amounts to a declaration of war against georgia and the involvement in the internal affairs of a neighboring state - not without hope for western , especially american support against the alleged russian aggressor . humanitarian intervention or russian imperialism ? in a similarly mixed-up way , russia is trying to justify its policies .
in line with western arguments during the nato mission against serbia to protect kosovo , russian officials are now presenting the military intervention as a " humanitarian " one : moscow needs to save " russian lives " and strengthen the so-called russian peacekeepers . this could help to justify air attacks against georgian cities and infrastructure - just like nato did in serbia .
in case of a successful military mission in south ossetia , a future independence and subsequent russian incorporation of south ossetia could be justified - true to the western scenario in kosovo .
keeping in mind the highly patriotic mood in russia , this development would also get the support of large parts of the russian society , which is still traumatized by the disintegration of the soviet union . ruso-western alientation it 's hard to predict the military outcome and any future political developments right now .
but one thing is certain : both sides have learned from each other , but have n't understood a thing .
the alienation between russia and georgia , between russia and the west , will increase because of the war in south ossetia . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information war , however , has also reached a new level of escalation , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . there 's no doubt that georgia 's military intervention in south ossetia has lead to a war between georgia and russia .
while the military situation is still hard to grasp , georgia and russia - the latter being south ossetia 's traditional protecting power - have also begun a media and information war .
it wo n't make it easier to reach a political solution to the conflict .
most likely , the conflict will even broaden the estrangement between russia and the west . georgia - victim or aggressor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel georgian president saakashvili is presenting his military actions against the south ossetian regime as righteous ones .
from a legal point of view , he 's not wrong .
the republic of south ossetia , which is not recognized internationally , formally belongs to the georgian state even if tbilisi has lost factual control there for the past 15 years and almost all residents have russian passports . interestingly enough , saakashvili uses the same words to describe the military operation in south ossetia that russia used to justify its intervention in chechnya : " restoring the constutional order " in georgia .
as far as saakashvili is concerned , russia 's involvement in south ossetia amounts to a declaration of war against georgia and the involvement in the internal affairs of a neighboring state - not without hope for western , especially american support against the alleged russian aggressor . humanitarian intervention or russian imperialism ? in a similarly mixed-up way , russia is trying to justify its policies .
in line with western arguments during the nato mission against serbia to protect kosovo , russian officials are now presenting the military intervention as a " humanitarian " one : moscow needs to save " russian lives " and strengthen the so-called russian peacekeepers . this could help to justify air attacks against georgian cities and infrastructure - just like nato did in serbia .
in case of a successful military mission in south ossetia , a future independence and subsequent russian incorporation of south ossetia could be justified - true to the western scenario in kosovo .
keeping in mind the highly patriotic mood in russia , this development would also get the support of large parts of the russian society , which is still traumatized by the disintegration of the soviet union . ruso-western alientation it 's hard to predict the military outcome and any future political developments right now .
but one thing is certain : both sides have learned from each other , but have n't understood a thing .
the alienation between russia and georgia , between russia and the west , will increase because of the war in south ossetia . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia can destroy it , but it will be neither quick nor easy , regional observers say .
us special forces troops , and later us marines replacing them , have for the last half decade been systematically training selected georgian units to nato standards .
gone are the soviet traditions of soldiers ' never firing their weapons until the war breaks out , or tanks too valuable to drive out of the motor pool .
using standard training plans familiar to the average us army or marine recruit , the us educators have focused on basics : teaching georgian soldiers small unit tactics , marksmanship , and individual initiative .
the us trainers also took the georgian officer corps to school , pushing lessons and buzz words learned by america in its recent wars .
among these , are making the air force and army work together -lrb- inter-service cooperation -rrb- , trying to surprise the opponent and possess lots of information about him -lrb- the information battle -rrb- , getting beans and bullets to the troops -lrb- logistics -rrb- , and enforcing the bog-standard rule that good officers lead from the front .
best-paid jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikheil saakashvili has invested heavily in his country 's military saakashvili has fully backed up the american trainers : in high-unemployment georgia , the best-paid job available to an active young georgian man is within the ranks of the military .
today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .
returning home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a much larger army at its disposal georgia 's government on saturday called on those desert-hardened veterans , requesting the pentagon release the elite 13th battalion to return home from the middle east , to fight russians in ossetia .
saakashvili 's defense ministry , according to officials in tbilisi , spends some $ 930 million -lrb- 620 million euros -rrb- a year on its military , a drop in the bucket compared to russia , but a massive spike from $ 30 million spent in 1991 when georgia became independent .
perhaps tellingly , a lion 's share of georgia 's defense budget has gone to field training and soldier personal kit .
first-line georgian soldiers wear nato uniforms , kevlar helmets and body armour matching us issue , and carry the us-manufactured m-16 automatic rifle - a dramatic turn away from the way most former soviet republics outfit troops , with a mix of soviet-era hand-me-downs and more recent russian or chinese gear .
georgia has , however , not thrown out every last kalashnikov , and most of georgia 's reserves and second-line troops are not as well equipped , and trained marginally , similar to russian reserves that might be sent to the region .
big ticket items but georgia at the same time has according to military observers spent its limited money on a few well-chosen big ticket items : modern czech self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers -lrb- of which some now are bombarding tskhinvali -rrb- , turkish armored cars , and even a french missile boat .
the infantry force the georgians have fielded in ossetia , as a result , is by most accounts at least as competent as russian army elements opposing it , and by some standards -lrb- combat experience and field training -rrb- possibly even superior , observers said .
russia as a regional power , however , enjoys overall superiority over the georgians , in the short term with a much stronger air force , and in the longer term with the kremlin 's potential ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and conquer georgia - provided the kremlin has the will to take the losses needed to eliminate their doughty opponents .
a second and probably more critical question is , therefore , whether it is saakashvili or the kremlin that is more willing to spend soldier lives in what by all accounts promises to be more bloody fighting . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .
the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .
i just hope there are no deaths among the peaceful population in south ossetia . how can a war between russia and georgia be averted ? the only sensible step would be to end all the fighting and no matter what prevent the military escalation .
that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .
but the real reason is something different : georgia wants to enter nato and the european union .
russia will not allow georgia - a former member of the soviet union - to join these organizations and can not accept georgia 's pro-western aspirations . interview : dirk eckert -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .
at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .
georgian television showed images of corpses sprawled along sidewalks and streets , in some cases still holding luggage . who is in control ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from both sides are moving in on south ossetia control of tskhinvali appeared disputed on saturday , with georgian officials asserting total control of the city , and russian officials claiming that they had taken the city . refugees were leaving the region and heading north towards the russian border throughout the night , at times under georgian artillery fire . georgian forces late on friday ceased fire for some three hours to allow civilians to leave , but according to russian observers georgian shelling interdicted roads leading north throughout the night . georgia pulls troops from iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian has also mobilized its reserves georgia will reportedly withdraw its entire iraqi contingent of 2,000 soldiers and bring them home as soon as possible as the country is engaged in fierce fighting with russia over breakaway province south ossetia . the commander of the georgian contingent in iraq said that the full brigade would go home as soon as possible .

dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .

furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .

to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .

he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a second major award for 25-year-old ribery who joined bayern from marseille last year and who had already been voted france 's player of the year for 2007 .
german bundesliga players also chose him as their player of the year in a poll conducted by kicker towards the end of last season .

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .

14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .

estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .

ribery received 224 votes to 115 for chelsea midfielder ballack and 108 for bayern munich 's italy striker luca toni .
bayern 's philipp lahm and former skipper oliver kahn finished fourth and fifth in the poll , kicker said wednesday .
both ribery and toni were playing in their first season in the bundesliga , helping bayern to a league and cup double .
" it 's good for a sportsman to be recognized for his performances .
but i have to say that the titles won last year by the team are far more important , " the frenchman told yahoo sport .
it was a second major award for 25-year-old ribery who joined bayern from marseille last year and who had already been voted france 's player of the year for 2007 .
german bundesliga players also chose him as their player of the year in a poll conducted by kicker towards the end of last season .
“ we 're delighted and proud that franck ribery has been voted 2008 soccer player of the year by an overwhelming majority .
the accolade is thoroughly deserved , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told the club 's web site .

hitzfeld received 264 votes , with former bayern coach felix magath , now with wolfsburg , garnering 131 .
the female footballer of the year award went for an eighth successive time to striker birgit prinz of ffc frankfurt .
the kicker poll , eligible for any soccer player in germany , or any german soccer player playing abroad , has been awarded since 1960 .
ribery , currently injured , is only the second non-german to win the award following the brazilian ailton , then of werder bremen , in 2004 .

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "

prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "

dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .

ribery received 224 votes to 115 for chelsea midfielder ballack and 108 for bayern munich 's italy striker luca toni .
bayern 's philipp lahm and former skipper oliver kahn finished fourth and fifth in the poll , kicker said wednesday .
both ribery and toni were playing in their first season in the bundesliga , helping bayern to a league and cup double .
" it 's good for a sportsman to be recognized for his performances .
but i have to say that the titles won last year by the team are far more important , " the frenchman told yahoo sport .
it was a second major award for 25-year-old ribery who joined bayern from marseille last year and who had already been voted france 's player of the year for 2007 .
german bundesliga players also chose him as their player of the year in a poll conducted by kicker towards the end of last season .
“ we 're delighted and proud that franck ribery has been voted 2008 soccer player of the year by an overwhelming majority .
the accolade is thoroughly deserved , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge told the club 's web site .

hitzfeld received 264 votes , with former bayern coach felix magath , now with wolfsburg , garnering 131 .
the female footballer of the year award went for an eighth successive time to striker birgit prinz of ffc frankfurt .
the kicker poll , eligible for any soccer player in germany , or any german soccer player playing abroad , has been awarded since 1960 .
ribery , currently injured , is only the second non-german to win the award following the brazilian ailton , then of werder bremen , in 2004 .

this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia can destroy it , but it will be neither quick nor easy , regional observers say .
us special forces troops , and later us marines replacing them , have for the last half decade been systematically training selected georgian units to nato standards .
gone are the soviet traditions of soldiers ' never firing their weapons until the war breaks out , or tanks too valuable to drive out of the motor pool .
using standard training plans familiar to the average us army or marine recruit , the us educators have focused on basics : teaching georgian soldiers small unit tactics , marksmanship , and individual initiative .
the us trainers also took the georgian officer corps to school , pushing lessons and buzz words learned by america in its recent wars .
among these , are making the air force and army work together -lrb- inter-service cooperation -rrb- , trying to surprise the opponent and possess lots of information about him -lrb- the information battle -rrb- , getting beans and bullets to the troops -lrb- logistics -rrb- , and enforcing the bog-standard rule that good officers lead from the front .
best-paid jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikheil saakashvili has invested heavily in his country 's military saakashvili has fully backed up the american trainers : in high-unemployment georgia , the best-paid job available to an active young georgian man is within the ranks of the military .
today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .
returning home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a much larger army at its disposal georgia 's government on saturday called on those desert-hardened veterans , requesting the pentagon release the elite 13th battalion to return home from the middle east , to fight russians in ossetia .
saakashvili 's defense ministry , according to officials in tbilisi , spends some $ 930 million -lrb- 620 million euros -rrb- a year on its military , a drop in the bucket compared to russia , but a massive spike from $ 30 million spent in 1991 when georgia became independent .
perhaps tellingly , a lion 's share of georgia 's defense budget has gone to field training and soldier personal kit .
first-line georgian soldiers wear nato uniforms , kevlar helmets and body armour matching us issue , and carry the us-manufactured m-16 automatic rifle - a dramatic turn away from the way most former soviet republics outfit troops , with a mix of soviet-era hand-me-downs and more recent russian or chinese gear .
georgia has , however , not thrown out every last kalashnikov , and most of georgia 's reserves and second-line troops are not as well equipped , and trained marginally , similar to russian reserves that might be sent to the region .
big ticket items but georgia at the same time has according to military observers spent its limited money on a few well-chosen big ticket items : modern czech self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers -lrb- of which some now are bombarding tskhinvali -rrb- , turkish armored cars , and even a french missile boat .

russia as a regional power , however , enjoys overall superiority over the georgians , in the short term with a much stronger air force , and in the longer term with the kremlin 's potential ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and conquer georgia - provided the kremlin has the will to take the losses needed to eliminate their doughty opponents .
a second and probably more critical question is , therefore , whether it is saakashvili or the kremlin that is more willing to spend soldier lives in what by all accounts promises to be more bloody fighting . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hitch-hiker 's guide to understanding eu jargon europe -pipe- 09.08.2008 will the real heart of europe please stand up ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's geographical center is actually near the german town of gelnhausen from austria to ukraine , more than a few countries have proudly anointed themselves the provider of lifeblood for the european continent .
will the real heart of europe please stand up ? geographically , the continent of europe blends into asia with no obvious border .
that peculiarity allows countries across europe to claim that they are its heart - often on very different grounds .
slovakia is one of the more recent countries to lay claim to the title .
dozens of websites refer to the eu newcomer as the " heart of europe , " and many geographers argue that it lies exactly midway between europe 's extremes .
serious academic attention was even devoted to the matter in a paper published by the chief research fellow at the institute for sociology of the slovak academy of science , ladislav machacek , in 2003 .
location , location , location according to machacek , the country 's location " evokes in the slovaks exalted emotions that they are anchored in the very heart of europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary celebrated joining europe but slovakia 's neighbors also exploit their central locations to make the highly contested anatomical claim .
prague and budapest extend their self-promotion as the heart of europe on cultural grounds as well .
and british historian norman davies famously called his history of poland " heart of europe " when he published it in 1984 .
in 2006 , travel writer and historian bart nabrdalik wrote that vienna deserves to be seen as the " true heart of europe . "
viennese residents ' " soft , melodious german has a touch of italian charm , french joie de vivre and especially a sprinkle of slavic sentimentality and melancholy , " he wrote as justification .
but lately , the central europeans have faced a challenge from the shores of the baltic sea .
in 2000 , experts from the french national geographic institute calculated that the center of europe lies in lithuania .
history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .
in april , 2005 ukrainian president viktor yushchenko proclaimed : " ukraine is the heart of europe .
tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .
the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .
but the south ossetian government rejected all the offers .
it 's unfortunate that the georgian side allowed itself to be provoked .
but the daily attacks from the ossetian side were just too much to bear for the residents in the targeted georgian villages .
i just hope there are no deaths among the peaceful population in south ossetia . how can a war between russia and georgia be averted ? the only sensible step would be to end all the fighting and no matter what prevent the military escalation .
that applies to both russia and georgia .
each side must sit down at the table and begin negotiating . south ossetia voted for independence in a 2006 referendum .
why does n't georgia recognize this ? two principles collide here : the principle of self-sovereignty and the fundamental principle of the territorial integrity of a nation .
south ossetia is a part of georgia , and that needs to be respected .
the case of kosovo is not really an appropriate analogy : the right to self-sovereignty played the decisive role there , but the charges of ethnic cleansing were also recognized on an international level .
that 's not the case in south ossetia .
so for this reason , the territorial integrity of georgia takes precedence . why does russia support the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia ? from a formal perspective , russia has the right to protect south ossetia , because many of the residents in the region are also citizens of the russian federation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.08.2008 opinion : do n't talk up a global recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warnings of a dent in the global economic condition are progressively becoming louder and more numerous .
is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

" we believe all issues can be resolved by dialogue . " international olympic committee spokeswoman giselle davies said : " conflict is not what we want to see .
it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for . " the fighting in southern ossetia , a breakaway enclave of georgia , erupted at the same time as the beijing olympics opened in the presence of georgian and russian athletes and with russian premier vladimir putin among the spectators in beijing 's national stadium . sad precedence it came despite a call from the united nations to respect the olympics truce and for warring parties to cease all hostilities worldwide during the games .
it was the first time that a conflict began on the opening day of an olympics . " the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for , " said davies , but added that it had to be implemented by the un .
" it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict . " davies said it was not appropriate for the ioc to comment on the fact that the 2014 winter games ' host city of sochi was close to south ossetia . " it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games , " she said . davies also said that the conflict , and politics in general , was not discussed when ioc president jacques rogge met with putin on friday . china calls for ceasefire olympic host china meanwhile joined many other countries saturday in urging both sides to seek dialogue .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .
at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .
georgian television showed images of corpses sprawled along sidewalks and streets , in some cases still holding luggage . who is in control ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from both sides are moving in on south ossetia control of tskhinvali appeared disputed on saturday , with georgian officials asserting total control of the city , and russian officials claiming that they had taken the city . refugees were leaving the region and heading north towards the russian border throughout the night , at times under georgian artillery fire . georgian forces late on friday ceased fire for some three hours to allow civilians to leave , but according to russian observers georgian shelling interdicted roads leading north throughout the night . georgia pulls troops from iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian has also mobilized its reserves georgia will reportedly withdraw its entire iraqi contingent of 2,000 soldiers and bring them home as soon as possible as the country is engaged in fierce fighting with russia over breakaway province south ossetia . the commander of the georgian contingent in iraq said that the full brigade would go home as soon as possible .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .
at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .
georgian television showed images of corpses sprawled along sidewalks and streets , in some cases still holding luggage . who is in control ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from both sides are moving in on south ossetia control of tskhinvali appeared disputed on saturday , with georgian officials asserting total control of the city , and russian officials claiming that they had taken the city . refugees were leaving the region and heading north towards the russian border throughout the night , at times under georgian artillery fire . georgian forces late on friday ceased fire for some three hours to allow civilians to leave , but according to russian observers georgian shelling interdicted roads leading north throughout the night . georgia pulls troops from iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian has also mobilized its reserves georgia will reportedly withdraw its entire iraqi contingent of 2,000 soldiers and bring them home as soon as possible as the country is engaged in fierce fighting with russia over breakaway province south ossetia . the commander of the georgian contingent in iraq said that the full brigade would go home as soon as possible .

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information war , however , has also reached a new level of escalation , says dw 's ingo mannteufel . there 's no doubt that georgia 's military intervention in south ossetia has lead to a war between georgia and russia .
while the military situation is still hard to grasp , georgia and russia - the latter being south ossetia 's traditional protecting power - have also begun a media and information war .
it wo n't make it easier to reach a political solution to the conflict .
most likely , the conflict will even broaden the estrangement between russia and the west . georgia - victim or aggressor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel georgian president saakashvili is presenting his military actions against the south ossetian regime as righteous ones .
from a legal point of view , he 's not wrong .
the republic of south ossetia , which is not recognized internationally , formally belongs to the georgian state even if tbilisi has lost factual control there for the past 15 years and almost all residents have russian passports . interestingly enough , saakashvili uses the same words to describe the military operation in south ossetia that russia used to justify its intervention in chechnya : " restoring the constutional order " in georgia .
as far as saakashvili is concerned , russia 's involvement in south ossetia amounts to a declaration of war against georgia and the involvement in the internal affairs of a neighboring state - not without hope for western , especially american support against the alleged russian aggressor . humanitarian intervention or russian imperialism ? in a similarly mixed-up way , russia is trying to justify its policies .
in line with western arguments during the nato mission against serbia to protect kosovo , russian officials are now presenting the military intervention as a " humanitarian " one : moscow needs to save " russian lives " and strengthen the so-called russian peacekeepers . this could help to justify air attacks against georgian cities and infrastructure - just like nato did in serbia .
in case of a successful military mission in south ossetia , a future independence and subsequent russian incorporation of south ossetia could be justified - true to the western scenario in kosovo .
keeping in mind the highly patriotic mood in russia , this development would also get the support of large parts of the russian society , which is still traumatized by the disintegration of the soviet union . ruso-western alientation it 's hard to predict the military outcome and any future political developments right now .
but one thing is certain : both sides have learned from each other , but have n't understood a thing .
the alienation between russia and georgia , between russia and the west , will increase because of the war in south ossetia . ingo mannteufel heads deutsche welle 's russian online and radio programs -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

history of domination the announcement led to a surge of lithuanian claims that their country is the continent 's power organ .
but it also provoked renewed counter-claims from neighbors poland and even belarus .

tell me , please , how can europe live without its heart ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia - the next heart ?
that may have been rhetorical , but it may be the key to understanding why so many european countries want to be seen as europe 's beating center .
the one thing which almost all those who make the claim have in common is that they were dominated , and in some cases ruled directly , by moscow until the collapse of the ussr .
that domination has left them with a deep-seated urge to prove that they are " real europeans , " rightful members of the western club .
nordic estonians , western czechs thus poles and lithuanians are adamant that they come from central , not eastern europe .
estonians insist that they are nordic , and czechs point out that their capital is further west than vienna .
and yushchenko is struggling to move his country closer to europe at a time when many opponents say that ukraine , as the birthplace of russian civilization , should rather be turning east .
cynics might argue that a claim to be europe 's heart says far more about a country 's own feelings than it does about europe 's .
and as more ever more countries line up to make the claim -lrb- slovenia annointed itself the heart of europe in january , -rrb- it is worth asking whether their enthusiasm says more about europe 's enduring strength - or their own underlying uncertainty . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible , " lomaia said in response to questions from western journalists . during an earlier press conference conducted in english , saakashvili said russia had launched a full-scale military invasion of his country . " i call for an immediate ceasefire , " saakashvili said , with georgian and eu flags standing behind him .
" russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia . " during a televised earlier meeting of the georgian national security council , saakashvili had said that he had signed a decree on a state of war .
at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .
georgian television showed images of corpses sprawled along sidewalks and streets , in some cases still holding luggage . who is in control ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from both sides are moving in on south ossetia control of tskhinvali appeared disputed on saturday , with georgian officials asserting total control of the city , and russian officials claiming that they had taken the city . refugees were leaving the region and heading north towards the russian border throughout the night , at times under georgian artillery fire . georgian forces late on friday ceased fire for some three hours to allow civilians to leave , but according to russian observers georgian shelling interdicted roads leading north throughout the night . georgia pulls troops from iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian has also mobilized its reserves georgia will reportedly withdraw its entire iraqi contingent of 2,000 soldiers and bring them home as soon as possible as the country is engaged in fierce fighting with russia over breakaway province south ossetia . the commander of the georgian contingent in iraq said that the full brigade would go home as soon as possible .

at the press conference , he pointed out that this did not mean any curtailment of press freedom , but instead called parliament to a permanent session and placed the entire country on high alert . russians hit georgian targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports on the damage vary widely on both sides russian warplanes meanwhile bombed and virtually destroyed a key georgian port and hit another city .
russian ambassador to georgia told the interfax news agency on saturday that at least 2,000 civilians have died in the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali as a result of fighting between russian and georgian forces . georgian officials have so far denied russian casualty figures , saying they were blown out of proportion . georgian officials said a russian aerial bombardment had hit sites near the capital tbilisi and key oil pipelines and " completely devastated " the black sea port of poti in attacks that the country 's un ambassador likened to " a full-scale military invasion . "
poti is a key port and staging post for moving oil and other energy from the caspian sea to the west . according to georgian public television , russian forces also started bombarding a georgian-controlled section of abkhazia , a second breakaway georgian region , hence broadening the war to a second stage . bush calls for end to bombing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush spoke in beijing on saturday us president george w. bush on saturday meanwhile said that russian attacks on georgia outside the war zone of south ossetia were a " dangerous escalation " of the crisis and urged moscow to halt the bombing immediately . " i 'm deeply concerned about the situation in georgia , " said bush , who is currently in beijing for the olympics .
" the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia .
they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis . " he said georgia 's territorial integrity must be respected and " we call for an end to the russian bombings . " osce head : no quick end to fighting finland 's foreign minister , the current head of the osce , meanwhile said saturday that a quick end to fighting in south ossetia was unlikely . " we can always hope , but a ceasefire looks at the moment , at least in the short term , very unlikely , " foreign minister alexander stubb of finland , the current chairman of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told finnish daily aamulehti . bildunterschrift : the osce monitors security in the region and has a mandate to promote talks between the parties to the conflict . russia on " peace enforcement operation " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says he needs to protect russian lives russian president dmitry medvedev said saturday that his country 's peacekeeping forces in georgia were carrying out a " peace enforcement operation " to protect civilians in south ossetia . " our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to -lrb- agree to -rrb- peace , " russian news agencies quoted medvedev as saying at a meeting with defense minister anatoly serdyukov .
" they are also responsible for protecting the population .
that 's what we are doing now . " georgian television showed images of hundreds of rockets and heavy artillery shells crashing into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali .
shelling reduced entire city blocks to rubble , according to eyewitnesses .
counts of civilian casualties varied widely , with georgia estimating between one and two dozen killed , and some 100 injured as of friday evening . eyewitnesses said many victims lost their lives when caught out in the open by artillery fire as they attempted to flee .
georgian television showed images of corpses sprawled along sidewalks and streets , in some cases still holding luggage . who is in control ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers from both sides are moving in on south ossetia control of tskhinvali appeared disputed on saturday , with georgian officials asserting total control of the city , and russian officials claiming that they had taken the city . refugees were leaving the region and heading north towards the russian border throughout the night , at times under georgian artillery fire . georgian forces late on friday ceased fire for some three hours to allow civilians to leave , but according to russian observers georgian shelling interdicted roads leading north throughout the night . georgia pulls troops from iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian has also mobilized its reserves georgia will reportedly withdraw its entire iraqi contingent of 2,000 soldiers and bring them home as soon as possible as the country is engaged in fierce fighting with russia over breakaway province south ossetia . the commander of the georgian contingent in iraq said that the full brigade would go home as soon as possible .

russia can destroy it , but it will be neither quick nor easy , regional observers say .
us special forces troops , and later us marines replacing them , have for the last half decade been systematically training selected georgian units to nato standards .
gone are the soviet traditions of soldiers ' never firing their weapons until the war breaks out , or tanks too valuable to drive out of the motor pool .
using standard training plans familiar to the average us army or marine recruit , the us educators have focused on basics : teaching georgian soldiers small unit tactics , marksmanship , and individual initiative .
the us trainers also took the georgian officer corps to school , pushing lessons and buzz words learned by america in its recent wars .
among these , are making the air force and army work together -lrb- inter-service cooperation -rrb- , trying to surprise the opponent and possess lots of information about him -lrb- the information battle -rrb- , getting beans and bullets to the troops -lrb- logistics -rrb- , and enforcing the bog-standard rule that good officers lead from the front .
best-paid jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikheil saakashvili has invested heavily in his country 's military saakashvili has fully backed up the american trainers : in high-unemployment georgia , the best-paid job available to an active young georgian man is within the ranks of the military .
today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .
returning home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has a much larger army at its disposal georgia 's government on saturday called on those desert-hardened veterans , requesting the pentagon release the elite 13th battalion to return home from the middle east , to fight russians in ossetia .
saakashvili 's defense ministry , according to officials in tbilisi , spends some $ 930 million -lrb- 620 million euros -rrb- a year on its military , a drop in the bucket compared to russia , but a massive spike from $ 30 million spent in 1991 when georgia became independent .
perhaps tellingly , a lion 's share of georgia 's defense budget has gone to field training and soldier personal kit .
first-line georgian soldiers wear nato uniforms , kevlar helmets and body armour matching us issue , and carry the us-manufactured m-16 automatic rifle - a dramatic turn away from the way most former soviet republics outfit troops , with a mix of soviet-era hand-me-downs and more recent russian or chinese gear .
georgia has , however , not thrown out every last kalashnikov , and most of georgia 's reserves and second-line troops are not as well equipped , and trained marginally , similar to russian reserves that might be sent to the region .
big ticket items but georgia at the same time has according to military observers spent its limited money on a few well-chosen big ticket items : modern czech self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers -lrb- of which some now are bombarding tskhinvali -rrb- , turkish armored cars , and even a french missile boat .
the infantry force the georgians have fielded in ossetia , as a result , is by most accounts at least as competent as russian army elements opposing it , and by some standards -lrb- combat experience and field training -rrb- possibly even superior , observers said .
russia as a regional power , however , enjoys overall superiority over the georgians , in the short term with a much stronger air force , and in the longer term with the kremlin 's potential ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and conquer georgia - provided the kremlin has the will to take the losses needed to eliminate their doughty opponents .
a second and probably more critical question is , therefore , whether it is saakashvili or the kremlin that is more willing to spend soldier lives in what by all accounts promises to be more bloody fighting . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it really that bad ?
dw 's rolf wenkel is n't convinced . for months , experts and commentators have been preparing us for the notion that the global economy is standing right before a downturn .
they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .

they say that in the us a recession threatens , in europe there is a clear deceleration of growth , and in china , too - although partially willed by politicians - the times of double-digit growth rates will soon be over . bildunterschrift : what the bankers of the us federal reserve have to say about their latest interest rate decisions does not exactly sound comforting either : the tense situation in the money markets , the paralyzing property market and the raised energy costs were weighing on the global economic condition , the fed explained .
furthermore , they say the financial markets remain under clear pressure .
the situation in the us job market is also fraught , they say .
with 5.7 percent , the unemployment rate in july climbed to its highest level since march 2004 .
the former head of the us federal reserve , alan greenspan , is even more pessimistic .
he warned in the financial times newspaper of the crisis of a century and prophesized that scores of banks would not survive this crisis . at the moment there is no shortage of pessimistic voices on the economic situation in the usa .
and when the economic situation in the largest national economy weakens , it is well-known that the rest of the world gets a cold .
skeptics do not even consider positive signals that indicate that everything does not have to end so badly .
yet , after initial calculations , the american economy has grown by 1.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008 .
a recession is looking different . but this growth is just a tax present from the bush government that is billions in debt , say the pessimists .
this consumer spending could soon fizzle out and then the consumers in the credit and property crisis would be hit directly . so is the glass half full or half empty ?
the international monetary fund has all the same raised the growth prognosis for the largest national economy in the world from 0.5 to 1.3 percent , in light of the unexpectedly strong consumer demand in the us .
to speak of recession in the face of such forecasts already borders on negligence . relief is especially coming from the other side .
the crude oil and energy prices that have made for worldwide bursts of inflation have been crumbling considerably for some time now .
that allows the central banks of this world once again to hope that the price pushes of the past were a passing occurrence and that they are not opening up into so-called second-round effects .
the decision by the us federal reserve should not be seen as anything other than a move to leave the key interest rate in the usa unchanged .
in a meeting on aug .
14 , the european central bank will also be taking precautions to further slow down the paralyzing growth strength with a new increase in the key interest rate . there is no question : every upsurge will come to a standstill .
sometimes the pessimists have an economic boom .
but to speak of a recession in light of the many contradictory signals is irresponsible .
whoever constantly warns of a crisis and a looming recession unsettles consumers and businesses - and in the end they keep talking about it until after the crisis itself has passed .
a downturn that everybody is talking about and that everybody is expecting is like a self-fulfilling prophecy : consumers save , businesses postpone their investments , jobs are cut , and goods wait on the shelves . but it does not have to get that far .
former german economics minister and federal chancellor , ludwig erhard , once said that 50 percent of economy is psychology .
if that is right then sympathetic psychologists should not tell their patient that he is sicker than he really is . rolf wenkel is a business editor at dw-radio -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.08.2008 hollywood helps revive berlin 's former movie glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " metropolis " was filmed in babelsberg in 1927 star-studded movie productions with hollywood a-list actors and a bit of financial support from the german government are returning a film studio near berlin to its long-lost glitz . almost two decades after a popular uprising swept away the communist east german state , berlin 's film movie business is enjoying something of a renaissance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quentin tarantino 's been spotted around berlin us director quentin tarantino jetted into the german capital this month to begin laying the ground for the shooting of a new film set between the two world wars .
with two of hollywood 's top actors - brad pitt and leonardo dicaprio - slated for leading roles , tarantino 's inglorious bastards is likely to add to the star power that berlin has been basking in recently . only a few years ago , the sprawling babelsberg film studios on the outskirts of berlin were facing an uncertain future .
but now , about 80 years after it rocketed to global movie fame with such cinema classics as " the blue angel , " " the cabinet of dr caligari " and " metropolis , " babelsberg is in the midst of a revival following a surge in the number of big-budget hollywood productions being mounted at the historic studios . last year 12 major movies were made at babelsberg and about 8 are expected to be produced this year .
in 2006 , only one film was made at babelsberg studios .
but generous state financial support and a sudden new-found interest in german stories are helping berlin and babelsberg to reclaim a place on the world film stage . " i assume that we will be as successful this year " , said babelsberg chief carl woebcken with the studios swinging back into the black in 2007 to report a profit of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 9.3 million -rrb- after posting a 2.7-million-euros loss in 2006 . star-studded set former james bond pierce brosnan is due in berlin early next year for the production of a thriller by roman polanski .
britain 's kate winslet has also been in berlin shooting the adaptation of the best-selling novel " the reader " by german law professor-turned-novelist bernhard schlink . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oscar-winning actress helen mirren filmed just east of berlin winslet stepped into the film after pregnancy forced the australian-born nicole kidman to pull out of the movie .
in the meantime , oscar-winning actress helen mirren has been playing the role of classic russian writer leo tolstoy 's wife in a movie shot to the east of berlin . the bourne ultimatum , part of matt damon 's trilogy about rogue agent jason bourne , was also partly shot in babelsberg , which is both the world 's oldest big movie studio complex and now the most modern in europe . susan sarandon , john goodman and emilie hirsh also recently wrapped up at babelsberg the 130-million-dollar production of the wachowski brothers ' action movie " speed racer . " " babelsberg is a marvellous place for filmmaking , " said speed racer producer joel silver .
" so much so , that we are now already looking around intensively for new opportunities for further films to produce here . " bryan singer 's valkyrie starring tom cruise as count claus von stauffenberg , who led a 1944 plot to assassinate hitler was also produced at babelsberg with the studios forced last year to rent additional space despite a doubling of studio capacity in recent years . checkered history ca pre-world war ii rival to hollywood , babelsberg 's re-emergence on the global filmmaking map represents the latest twist in the studios ' checkered history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph goebbels abused babelberg for nazi propaganda apart from helping to launch the movie careers of marlene dietrich and greta garbo , babelsberg also played a role in the darker side of germany 's tumultuous past with josef goebbels turning babelsberg into a factory for nazi propaganda . indeed , hitler 's rise to power during the 1930 's triggered a mass exodus from germany 's pre-war movie business to the us film industry , with babelsberg churning out more than 1000 films during the third reich . this included some of the nazis ' most virulent and notorious propaganda films such as the anti-semitic " jud suess . " state support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise received german subsidies for his film but also helping to bolster the more recent change in fortunes for both babelsberg and the german film industry has been a new set of financial benefits drawn up by berlin for movie-making , including a hefty 60 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- a year for film production . as part of that , the german federal film fund paid subsidies totaling 4.8 million euros for " valkyrie . " speed racer , warner brothers ' blockbuster adaptation of the cult 1960s japanese cartoon series , had a total budget of about 40 million euros , including 9.2 million euros from the german film authorities . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

8 the conflict over south ossetia must be resolved politically , says the former education minister from georgia , alexander kartosia .
the territorial integrity of georgia , however , is not up for questioning . alexander kartosia was education minister in georgia from 1998 to 2004 .
he now teaches at the european university viadrina in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in germany . dw-world.de : georgia is applying military force against the breakaway enclave of south ossetia .
is the best way to respond to claims for independence by both south ossetia and abkhazia ? alexander kartosia : no , that 's not the way to solve the conflict .
you see , the military offensive came suddenly .
the situation escalated from day to day .
the georgian government offered to sit down at the negotiating table with the de facto government in south ossetia several times last week .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south ossetian home is destroyed by a georgian strike .
" a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing , " he added as he accused georgia of " gross violations of humanitarian law , " including reports of ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilians . georgian ambassador irakli alasania rejected churkin 's charges , telling the 15-nation council that tbilisi was merely defending itself against russian aggression .
he said russia was bombing civilian targets and infrastructure in georgia . " georgian troops are not targeting peacekeepers , " he said .
turning directly to churkin , he asked , " are you ready to stop the bombers in the air ? " demands for russia withdrawal asked about reports that russian fighter jets bombed a container tank and civilian infrastructure in the georgian port of poti , churkin said : " i do n't have this information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fighter jet drops munitions near the georgian town of gori .
alasania demanded the russian federation " immediately terminate aerial bombardments , immediately pull out the occupying forces , and negotiate cease-fire . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south ossetian home is destroyed by a georgian strike .
" a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing , " he added as he accused georgia of " gross violations of humanitarian law , " including reports of ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilians . georgian ambassador irakli alasania rejected churkin 's charges , telling the 15-nation council that tbilisi was merely defending itself against russian aggression .
he said russia was bombing civilian targets and infrastructure in georgia . " georgian troops are not targeting peacekeepers , " he said .
turning directly to churkin , he asked , " are you ready to stop the bombers in the air ? " demands for russia withdrawal asked about reports that russian fighter jets bombed a container tank and civilian infrastructure in the georgian port of poti , churkin said : " i do n't have this information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fighter jet drops munitions near the georgian town of gori .
alasania demanded the russian federation " immediately terminate aerial bombardments , immediately pull out the occupying forces , and negotiate cease-fire . "
he said president mikheil saakashvili was ready for direct peace talks with the russians . but churkin made clear that russia would never abandon the region .
" historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of the security of the people of the caucuses , " he said . un fails to call for ceasefire in its second emergency meeting on the south ossetia crisis within 12 hours , the un on friday failed to produce the much hoped for statement calling for an immediate truce . at georgia 's request , the 15-member council convened for its second emergency meeting on the crisis within 12 hours to try to defuse the mounting tension .
but the council could not agree on the language for a statement calling for a ceasefire . bildunterschrift : map of georgia and its enclaves south ossetia and abkhazia belgian ambassador jan grauls , who holds the council 's rotating presidency , said council members were unable to reach an agreement on the wording of an appeal and would likely meet again on saturday with the aim of issuing a statement backed by all 15 member states .

today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .

saakashvili 's defense ministry , according to officials in tbilisi , spends some $ 930 million -lrb- 620 million euros -rrb- a year on its military , a drop in the bucket compared to russia , but a massive spike from $ 30 million spent in 1991 when georgia became independent .
perhaps tellingly , a lion 's share of georgia 's defense budget has gone to field training and soldier personal kit .
first-line georgian soldiers wear nato uniforms , kevlar helmets and body armour matching us issue , and carry the us-manufactured m-16 automatic rifle - a dramatic turn away from the way most former soviet republics outfit troops , with a mix of soviet-era hand-me-downs and more recent russian or chinese gear .
georgia has , however , not thrown out every last kalashnikov , and most of georgia 's reserves and second-line troops are not as well equipped , and trained marginally , similar to russian reserves that might be sent to the region .
big ticket items but georgia at the same time has according to military observers spent its limited money on a few well-chosen big ticket items : modern czech self-propelled howitzers and rocket launchers -lrb- of which some now are bombarding tskhinvali -rrb- , turkish armored cars , and even a french missile boat .
the infantry force the georgians have fielded in ossetia , as a result , is by most accounts at least as competent as russian army elements opposing it , and by some standards -lrb- combat experience and field training -rrb- possibly even superior , observers said .
russia as a regional power , however , enjoys overall superiority over the georgians , in the short term with a much stronger air force , and in the longer term with the kremlin 's potential ability to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops and conquer georgia - provided the kremlin has the will to take the losses needed to eliminate their doughty opponents .
a second and probably more critical question is , therefore , whether it is saakashvili or the kremlin that is more willing to spend soldier lives in what by all accounts promises to be more bloody fighting . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia can destroy it , but it will be neither quick nor easy , regional observers say .
us special forces troops , and later us marines replacing them , have for the last half decade been systematically training selected georgian units to nato standards .
gone are the soviet traditions of soldiers ' never firing their weapons until the war breaks out , or tanks too valuable to drive out of the motor pool .
using standard training plans familiar to the average us army or marine recruit , the us educators have focused on basics : teaching georgian soldiers small unit tactics , marksmanship , and individual initiative .
the us trainers also took the georgian officer corps to school , pushing lessons and buzz words learned by america in its recent wars .
among these , are making the air force and army work together -lrb- inter-service cooperation -rrb- , trying to surprise the opponent and possess lots of information about him -lrb- the information battle -rrb- , getting beans and bullets to the troops -lrb- logistics -rrb- , and enforcing the bog-standard rule that good officers lead from the front .
best-paid jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president mikheil saakashvili has invested heavily in his country 's military saakashvili has fully backed up the american trainers : in high-unemployment georgia , the best-paid job available to an active young georgian man is within the ranks of the military .
today , roughly one-quarter of georgia 's functional land forces are us-trained .
the backbone of the georgian army is seven infantry battalions raised from scratch and brought by the us green berets from boot camp to something quite close to nato-standard combat readiness over the years , a mass of some 5,000 men .
georgia since 2003 has been among the us ' most enthusiastic supporters of international forces in afghanistan , kosovo , and iraq .
currently georgia , once a minor soviet republic of some 4.5 million inhabitants , fields the third-largest foreign force in iraq , after the us and britain .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

fighting has spread to the separatist province abkhazia . russian un ambassador vitaly churkin told reporters following a closed-door session of the security council on saturday , aug .
9 , that moscow has political and humanitarian reasons to remain in south ossetia . " russia will not pull out , " churkin said .
" in order for us to withdraw we have to make sure there wo n't be genocide there .
this is a grave matter . "
churkin claimed fighting since thursday has killed some 2,000 civilians and made more than 30,000 refugees , many of whom had fled into russia . russia , a veto power on the 15-nation council , called for the closed-door meeting a day after the body held an open debate to hear views from russian and georgian representatives as well as those of council members . " we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement , " belgian ambassador jan grauls told reporters . russia : elements of " genocide " georgia 's un ambasador irakli alasania urged the council in friday 's meeting to use its authority to end the fighting , saying his country was ready to negotiate a ceasefire if russia would immediately withdraw its troops from georgian territory . churkin rejected calls for a ceasefire , saying it would not be the right solution while fighting was raging .
he called instead for georgian troops to withdraw from south ossetia , saying the capital tskhinvali has been destroyed by georgian rocket fire . alasania accused russia of mounting a " full-scale military invasion " of georgia with tanks and combat troops , backed by airstrikes . moscow had accused georgia of violating an agreement that ended fighting in south ossetia in 1996 by attacking the breakaway region .
south ossetia had declared independence from tbilisi , which opposed it , in the early 1990s following the breakup of the soviet union . churkin - as well as russian prime minister vladimir putin - said russia viewed the georgian offensive as " something that has elements of genocide and war crimes situation . " putin earlier called for an investigation into alleged acts of genocide by georgian forces during their offensive against the breakaway province of south ossetia . georgia , a former soviet republic , had been at odds with moscow , charging it with interfering into its internal politics .
tbilisi has also been in conflict with moscow over its province of abkhazia , which has also demanded secession . the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- reported this week that thousands of civilians fled south ossetia for neighboring north ossetia-alania , in russia , while hundreds of others have fled to other parts of georgia . fighting spreads to abkhazia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia is not the only georgian province looking to break from tbilisi the council was convened to discuss the situation and was told by un special envoy for georgia , robert mullet , that fighting has spread to abkhazia , which has demanded secession from tbilisi .
abkhazia , like south ossetia , is inhabited by a sizable population of russians and moscow has maintained a peacekeeping there . mullet told the council that abkhazia was mobilizing troops and had asked the small unit of 15 un peacekeepers to pull out of the disputed upper kodori valley , which it did on saturday .
the un troops have moved to sukumi where it is safer . a strike of 12 jets hit the kodori gorge , a disputed region in georgia 's west , aleksander lomaia , georgia 's national security chief told the dpa news agency .
alekasandr bagapsh , the leader of abkhazia , a separatist province to georgia 's east , claimed responsibility for the attack , and said abkhazian ground forces were attacking in the region . bagapsh 's announcement marked a dramatic widening of fighting in the region , as it opened a new front of combat to the west . " there had been a marked escalation of military activities in south ossetia and beyond and events on the ground had deteriorated in the past 24 hours , " belgium 's grauls said . eu steps up the pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials are concerned the situation in south ossetia is worsening european union foreign ministers are to meet early next week to discuss the crisis in south ossetia , with the possible option of calling an emergency summit of the 27-member bloc , officials said saturday . a statement released by the french eu presidency said french president nicolas sarkozy had set as priorities the immediate cessation of hostilities , the observation of the territorial integrity of georgia and the withdrawal of georgian and russian troops . sarkozy , who had spoken with russian prime minister vladimir putin on the fringes of the olympics opening ceremony in beijing , was also to discuss the situation " in the coming hours " with russian president dmitri medvedev , german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w bush , the statement said . kouchner to travel to georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian prime minister putin -lrb- left -rrb- flew to north ossetia in russia , on the border with georgia french foreign minister bernard kouchner will travel to georgia on sunday in a bid to halt the fighting in south ossetia as part of his country 's role heading the european union presidency . kouchner will be accompanied by finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , who the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , the eu presidency said in a statement on paris on saturday . delegations from the united states , european union and osce were on the way to tiblisi to discuss the fighting between georgia and russia . france said " a continuation of the military action would have consequences on the relationship of the eu with russia " and urged it to " observe the internationally recognized borders of georgia . "
it welcomed georgia 's willingness for a ceasefire and said the eu " expects russia would accept such a ceasefire immediately . " strong condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian president saakashvili -lrb- left -rrb- accused russia of invading georgia earlier on saturday , the presidents of poland , lithuania , latvia and estonia condemned the actions of russian forces fighting in south ossetia . the declaration was " sharp , but the situation calls for it , " polish president lech kaczynski told journalists in warsaw . he described the russian intervention as incompatible with international law and an " act of aggression . " " the russian federation has crossed the ' red line ' with regard to maintaining peace and stability in the conflict zone and protecting russian citizens outside its borders , " the statement continued . the leaders of the four countries said they would employ " all available methods " so that aggression against a small european country would not go without protest . calling on all nato and eu members to " react accordingly " to the crisis , kaczynski called for more than " insignificant statements .

the volume of junk e-mail messages with an olympic theme spiked prior to the opening ceremony , said symantec .
the malicious messages try to trick people into visiting fake sites or opening booby-trapped e-mail attachments , say other firms .
some messages falsely claim users have won an olympic lottery and encourage them to respond to claim their prize .
hack attack " the beijing olympics is gearing up to be one of the biggest events of the year and hackers and spammers will see it as a massive opportunity to compromise the unwary , " said con mallom , a spokesman for symantec .
symantec said the messages in the spam it had seen related to the games ran the gamut of modern security threats .
" members of the public have to remember that they should not open e-mails or click on links from unknown sources , no matter how many gold medals they are offering , " said mr mallom .
rik ferguson of trend micro said the games could inspire attacks on sites related to the games in a bid to compromise them .
the hijacked sites would then be used to attack visitors keen to catch up with the sporting event . "
the most effective way to avoid the pitfalls is to make your device an unattractive target " carole thierault , sophos " we are fully anticipating malicious social engineering techniques to exploit people 's interest in this event , luring unsuspecting users into clicking on compromised websites and into handing over sensitive personal information , " he said .
security firm marshal said many of the malicious and junk messages emerging from the rustock botnet were about the games .
a botnet is made up of a collection of home computers that have been hijacked by a gang of hi-tech criminals who then put it to a variety of ends .
some gangs simply vacuum up the personal data they find on compromised machines , others use the botnets to pump out spam or to attack other sites .
phil hay , lead threat analyst for marshal , said e-mails sent out via rustock to catch people out were getting more sophisticated .
the latest batch appear to be about headline stories on cnn and many concern the olympics .
those clicking on the headlines get taken to a fake cnn video report and is asked to install a codec to watch the film .
those installing the codec become part of the rustock botnet .
" as time has gone on , the criminals behind rustock have adjusted the appearance and sophistication of their messages to become more convincing at fooling recipients into infecting themselves , " said mr hay .
security company messagelabs said it was not just members of the public that were at risk .
the company said it had seen a campaign that used e-mails crafted to look like they had been written by the international olympic committee .
the messages have been sent to those who are part of national sporting organisations or help train athletes .
travelling with the fake messages is a booby-trapped adobe pdf that , if installed , steals data from a compromised pc .
the vast majority of the computer security threats taking advantage of the olympics are aimed at users of windows pcs .
carole thierault , senior security consultant at sophos , said to stay safe people should keep their anti-virus software up to date , use a firewall and install updates to windows as they become available .
of course hackers will do their best to capitalise on this event , " said ms thierault .

the volume of junk e-mail messages with an olympic theme spiked prior to the opening ceremony , said symantec .
the malicious messages try to trick people into visiting fake sites or opening booby-trapped e-mail attachments , say other firms .
some messages falsely claim users have won an olympic lottery and encourage them to respond to claim their prize .
hack attack " the beijing olympics is gearing up to be one of the biggest events of the year and hackers and spammers will see it as a massive opportunity to compromise the unwary , " said con mallom , a spokesman for symantec .
symantec said the messages in the spam it had seen related to the games ran the gamut of modern security threats .
" members of the public have to remember that they should not open e-mails or click on links from unknown sources , no matter how many gold medals they are offering , " said mr mallom .

security firm marshal said many of the malicious and junk messages emerging from the rustock botnet were about the games .
a botnet is made up of a collection of home computers that have been hijacked by a gang of hi-tech criminals who then put it to a variety of ends .
some gangs simply vacuum up the personal data they find on compromised machines , others use the botnets to pump out spam or to attack other sites .
phil hay , lead threat analyst for marshal , said e-mails sent out via rustock to catch people out were getting more sophisticated .
the latest batch appear to be about headline stories on cnn and many concern the olympics .
those clicking on the headlines get taken to a fake cnn video report and is asked to install a codec to watch the film .
those installing the codec become part of the rustock botnet .
" as time has gone on , the criminals behind rustock have adjusted the appearance and sophistication of their messages to become more convincing at fooling recipients into infecting themselves , " said mr hay .
most attacks are aimed at pcs running windows security company messagelabs said it was not just members of the public that were at risk .
the company said it had seen a campaign that used e-mails crafted to look like they had been written by the international olympic committee .
the messages have been sent to those who are part of national sporting organisations or help train athletes .
travelling with the fake messages is a booby-trapped adobe pdf that , if installed , steals data from a compromised pc .
the vast majority of the computer security threats taking advantage of the olympics are aimed at users of windows pcs .
carole thierault , senior security consultant at sophos , said to stay safe people should keep their anti-virus software up to date , use a firewall and install updates to windows as they become available .
of course hackers will do their best to capitalise on this event , " said ms thierault .

the volume of junk e-mail messages with an olympic theme spiked prior to the opening ceremony , said symantec .
the malicious messages try to trick people into visiting fake sites or opening booby-trapped e-mail attachments , say other firms .
some messages falsely claim users have won an olympic lottery and encourage them to respond to claim their prize .
hack attack " the beijing olympics is gearing up to be one of the biggest events of the year and hackers and spammers will see it as a massive opportunity to compromise the unwary , " said con mallom , a spokesman for symantec .
symantec said the messages in the spam it had seen related to the games ran the gamut of modern security threats .
" members of the public have to remember that they should not open e-mails or click on links from unknown sources , no matter how many gold medals they are offering , " said mr mallom .
rik ferguson of trend micro said the games could inspire attacks on sites related to the games in a bid to compromise them .
the hijacked sites would then be used to attack visitors keen to catch up with the sporting event .
the most effective way to avoid the pitfalls is to make your device an unattractive target carole thierault , sophos " we are fully anticipating malicious social engineering techniques to exploit people 's interest in this event , luring unsuspecting users into clicking on compromised websites and into handing over sensitive personal information , " he said .
security firm marshal said many of the malicious and junk messages emerging from the rustock botnet were about the games .
a botnet is made up of a collection of home computers that have been hijacked by a gang of hi-tech criminals who then put it to a variety of ends .
some gangs simply vacuum up the personal data they find on compromised machines , others use the botnets to pump out spam or to attack other sites .
phil hay , lead threat analyst for marshal , said e-mails sent out via rustock to catch people out were getting more sophisticated .
the latest batch appear to be about headline stories on cnn and many concern the olympics .
those clicking on the headlines get taken to a fake cnn video report and is asked to install a codec to watch the film .
those installing the codec become part of the rustock botnet .
" as time has gone on , the criminals behind rustock have adjusted the appearance and sophistication of their messages to become more convincing at fooling recipients into infecting themselves , " said mr hay .
most attacks are aimed at pcs running windows security company messagelabs said it was not just members of the public that were at risk .
the company said it had seen a campaign that used e-mails crafted to look like they had been written by the international olympic committee .
the messages have been sent to those who are part of national sporting organisations or help train athletes .
travelling with the fake messages is a booby-trapped adobe pdf that , if installed , steals data from a compromised pc .
the vast majority of the computer security threats taking advantage of the olympics are aimed at users of windows pcs .
carole thierault , senior security consultant at sophos , said to stay safe people should keep their anti-virus software up to date , use a firewall and install updates to windows as they become available .
of course hackers will do their best to capitalise on this event , " said ms thierault .
" the most effective way to avoid the pitfalls is to make your device an unattractive target .

a disabled man claimed he had to travel seven miles -lrb- 11 km -rrb- home on his mobility scooter because a train was too full to allow him on .
geoffrey wali , 60 , said he travelled from fairbourne to barmouth , gwynedd in the morning , but was told he could not travel back on the 1645 train .
mr wali said he had to make his own way home , finally arriving at 1930 bst .
arriva trains wales said their service should have been better and apologised for any distress caused .
" i wanted to go to the bank in barmouth and so i rang arriva trains , which i have to do every time , but no-one answered , " said mr wali about the incident .
" i decided to chance it and they let me on , but on the way back the two carriages on the train were full .
" people were like sardines , some even standing with babies in their arms , " he said .
mr wali said he decided to try and make his own way to his home at the springfield hotel in fairbourne .
following the main roads would have meant a 13 mile -lrb- 21km -rrb- journey , but he used a small toll bridge which cut his journey to around seven miles , he said .
" i got back ok , but it was a bit traumatic as it 's quite scary on a scooter when you are passed by cars and bikes . "
he added : " i could understand it in winter , but it is disgusting that there were only two carriages on the train , as they do not seem to be catering to the holiday season at all . "
hotel owner geoff brittain , said : " if a car had come around one of the corners mr wali would not have stood a chance whatsoever .
" it is so dangerous when you think this is a 60mph road and the mobility scooter goes 8mph maximum . "
holiday period arriva trains wales head of franchise , michael vaughan said it was clear that lessons had to be learned from the incident .
" we will look at ways of improving our journey care procedures in this context , " he said .
" it is unfortunate that we are unable to convey some scooter types , and i would still urge any intending customers to contact us so that we can make the necessary assessment of their vehicle . "
on the size of the train mr vaughan said , " every train we have is deployed to best use over the busy summer holiday period " .
some " capacity " had been redeployed from commuter routes to holiday routes over the summer , but " flexibility " was limited because of " finite resources " he said .
the situation would be monitored , he added .
