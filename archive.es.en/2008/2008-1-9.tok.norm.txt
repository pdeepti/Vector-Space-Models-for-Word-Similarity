it later expanded to include the claims about prostitutes and sex parties being financed with company funds . german judges decided in late 2007 to begin a new enquiry after an unidentified former employee said piech was informed of the practices in the mid-1990s and had ordered an internal investigation . hartz has maintained that he was solely responsible for authorizing the payments , telling the court that he told piech only in " an informal manner " in 1994 of volkert 's demands to be paid better but emphasized that " details were not mentioned , " according to afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.01.2008 german expert : bush waited too long with mideast trip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he achieve something once he gets down ?
as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.01.2008 german expert : bush waited too long with mideast trip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he achieve something once he gets down ?
as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

companies have apparently chosen to disregard calls for international sanctions , according to a german business paper . germany imported 580 million euros -lrb- $ 853 million -rrb- worth of goods from iran in 2007 , a 50 percent increase over the previous year , the german business daily handelsblatt reported on wednesday , jan.9 , citing sources in the german foreign trade agency . the jump indicates a deliberate move in the german economy to resist us appeals to trim down trade with the islamic republic , said the paper .
the us demand for a cutback in trade came in addition to united nations sanctions . the us had threatened german banks with sanctions on the american market if they did not in turn put economic pressure on iran to cease its nuclear program .
germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank have complied . the united nations has called on iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program , which the west has said tehran is using to develop a nuclear bomb . iran has said it will not halt its nuclear program , which it insists serves only non-military purposes . red tape hinders exports to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has insisted that the nuclear program is purely civilian though german wholesalers and retailers bought significantly more iranian products last year , german sales to the country dropped . exports to iran dropped by 15 percent to 3.5 billion euros .

and that , says dw 's christina bergmann , may have been the key to her comeback - especially among democratic women . hillary clinton may have only bested rival barack obama by two percent , but her win in the new hampshire primary has huge implications for the new york senator 's campaign to win the democratic nomination for president . polls predicted an obama victory .
but predictions do n't decide what voters actually do with their ballots .
many only decide which candidate to support just before they go to polling stations . hillary clinton knows all about the perils of being the favorite .
for months , she was considered the frontrunner for the democratic nomination , only to get a nasty surprise in the iowa democratic caucus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in iowa , barack obama succeeded in attracting the most support among female voters , and he also pulled in a lot of independent and crossover votes from republicans . clinton 's campaign strategy was in shambles , and the sudden disintegration of her support led to an emotional moment in which the senator seemed to be choking back tears . showing weakness is usually a faux pas in politics , and her competitor john edwards could n't help but sneer that an american president was not allowed to engage such emotional displays . but new hampshire women did n't see expressing feelings as a weakness .
and despite speculation in the media about whether clinton 's wobbly moment was staged or not , female voters clearly believed hillary and gave her - and not obama - their support . what woman has n't had to fight back tears of rage , despair , frustration , disappointment or simple exhaustion ?
men may see that as weakness ; women do n't . whatever you think of hillary clinton , the new hampshire result puts her back in the race , which is a good thing .
her campaign did n't deserve to crash and burn before it had ever really got off the ground . that 's the real message that was sent by new hampshire 's female voters . the campaign for a democratic nomination now continues .
the voters , male and female , will now get a chance to decide whether a woman or an african-american will get the chance to become america 's next president . christina bergmann is dw-radio 's washington correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2008 opinion : mawkish moments have replaced reason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton 's victory in the new hampshire primary is being put down to her display of " genuine " emotion .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .
it would good if voters in the remaining 48 states looked beyond made-for-tv moments of sentiment and did some serious thinking about whether clinton or obama has more to offer america and the world . jefferson chase works for dw-tv and dw-world.de. send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .
" that is populism , not policy . "
the president of the central council of jews , charlotte knobloch on wednesday , jan .
9 , played down kramer 's comments , saying one could n't compare a democratic party such as the cdu with the npd . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .

but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .

" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .
" users will rate their own websites as best so that they appear at the top of the index .
wikia search is not a serious competitor for google .
it will more likely be a means of earning even more money . " christian gies -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .

what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?

what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 09.01.2008 german cars do n't deserve dirty reputation , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's clearly greener german cars than this classic vw bulli bus by now are german car makers doing enough to keep up with consumer tastes ?
or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2008 opinion : mawkish moments have replaced reason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton 's victory in the new hampshire primary is being put down to her display of " genuine " emotion .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .
it would good if voters in the remaining 48 states looked beyond made-for-tv moments of sentiment and did some serious thinking about whether clinton or obama has more to offer america and the world . jefferson chase works for dw-tv and dw-world.de. send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.01.2008 german expert : bush waited too long with mideast trip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he achieve something once he gets down ?
as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2008 opinion : mawkish moments have replaced reason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton 's victory in the new hampshire primary is being put down to her display of " genuine " emotion .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .
it would good if voters in the remaining 48 states looked beyond made-for-tv moments of sentiment and did some serious thinking about whether clinton or obama has more to offer america and the world . jefferson chase works for dw-tv and dw-world.de. send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .
" that is populism , not policy . "
the president of the central council of jews , charlotte knobloch on wednesday , jan .
9 , played down kramer 's comments , saying one could n't compare a democratic party such as the cdu with the npd . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .
" that is populism , not policy . "
the president of the central council of jews , charlotte knobloch on wednesday , jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.01.2008 german expert : bush waited too long with mideast trip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he achieve something once he gets down ?
as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the action was the result of months of investigation into an alleged human trafficking ring . the arrests came in the early morning hours of wednesday , jan .
9 in the industrial cities of gelsenkirchen , essen and mülheim .
six people were formally arrested , while five others were detained for investigation and one other person was still being sought .
authorities think the alleged human traffickers had been paid to bring more than 100 iraqi refugees to sweden , where they planned to apply for asylum .
sixty-three refugees have been caught in germany and italy this year , but at least 60 others are thought to have gotten through to sweden .
a police spokesperson said the band rented camper vans to transport the refugees from greece across europe via italy , austria and germany .
the dpa news agency reported that those arrested were iraqi nationals .
but other sources said the police had not commented on the nationality of the suspected smugglers .
the arrests were the result of an investigation that started in september 2007 and involved some 200 police officials .
experts say that iraqi refugees often land on the european continent in greece or italy , then try to make their way through germany to sweden , which has some of the most liberal asylum laws in the eu . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .
the result was an immediate rise in share prices for germany 's largest pay-tv operator .
it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .
" pay tv is one of the central focuses of murdoch 's news corp , " media business expert adam bird told the online version of germany 's spiegel magazine .
" with bskyb , he 's one of the most successful pay-tv operators in the world , and he showed with sky italia that he can turn around difficult situations , " bird said .
helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's rtl tv station told the on-line version of stern magazine that murdoch might be giving the german market a second chance .
" perhaps he just wanted to stick his toe in the water again to see if something could be developed , " he said .
close relationship with the bundesliga bildunterschrift : the bundesliga is premiere 's main attraction other experts said that the deal makes sense because it will allow murdoch to sell his other wares .
" by getting into premiere , murdoch is acquiring another platform to market the media products produced by news corp , " media analyst larry witt told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
premiere 's flagship product is bundesliga soccer .
last season , the station lost a bidding war to rivals arena for the rights to broadcast league matches live .
but arena proved unable to master the logistics and were forced , in essence , to turn responsibility for telecasting the games back over to premiere , cementing the relationship between the station and germany 's most popular sport .
" the past has shown that -lsb- live football -rsb- does n't work without premiere , " media analyst friedrich schellmoser told spiegel online .
uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch has the analysts guessing with his latest move but despite the positives , experts feel that murdoch will struggle to raise the profile of premiere in germany .
only 4.2 million germans have premiere , and a far lower percentage of the german population uses pay-tv services than in other countries .
" they have different television structures , " helmut thoma told stern online .
" in britain , there were only four or five channels before pay tv came along .
in that situation , the broad offerings of sky were able to be successful .
but in germany there 's a much greater variety of free terrestrial stations so that there not that much left over for pay tv . "
premier has rarely made money in the past , and many years it lost millions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 09.01.2008 wikia launches search engine , challenges google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take a lot of time , if wikia is ever to rival google wikipedia founder jimmy wales has unveiled his rival platform , wikia search , for navigating the web .
but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .
" users will rate their own websites as best so that they appear at the top of the index .
wikia search is not a serious competitor for google .
it will more likely be a means of earning even more money . " christian gies -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .
" users will rate their own websites as best so that they appear at the top of the index .

home minister radzi sheikh ahmad admitted that the government was trying to reduce the number of foreign workers , but said there was no move to limit the numbers of workers from india specifically . there has been some confusion in malaysia and india this week about conflicting announcements in the media about migrant workers .
cynthia gabriel , the regional co-ordinator for caram asia - a regional network working on migration and health issues - shed some light on the matter .
" the government of malaysia only froze bangladeshi workers from coming into malaysia , " she explained .
" they did not freeze workers coming from other countries .
the announcement yesterday in the newspapers about indian workers now being banned from coming into malaysia was new , a surprise . "
quick denial the announcement coincided with the visit to kuala lumpur of indian defence minister a.k. anthony to discuss defence co-operation .
he returned to india saying the malaysian government had conveyed it wanted to sign a bilateral agreement as soon as possible , regulating employment conditions for indian nationals in malaysia and malaysian nationals in india .
he added that nobody had mentioned there being a ban on indian workers being recruited .
cynthia gabriel from caram asia said the announcement was quickly retracted for fear of exacerbating tension between the two countries : " within 24 hours , there was a denial that was issued saying there was no such thing . "
vital labour force analysts estimate that there are approximately 2.5 million migrant workers in malaysia and at least half are undocumented , or illegal .
they are mainly from indonesia , the philippines , thailand , bangladesh and india .
most of them work in the unskilled and semi-skilled sectors , which are flourishing because of the country 's fast-growing economy .
because malaysians are becoming increasingly reluctant to take up basic jobs , migrant workers are needed but they are often subjected to abuse .
last autumn , the hindu rights action force in malaysia led several protests against what it said were discriminatory government policies against the country 's minority indian population - drawing several thousand participants .
five leaders of the organisation were arrested in december on the grounds that they were threatening " racial and religious harmony among malaysia ’ s malay , chinese , and indian communities " .
they are awaiting trial .
rights violations take place both in malaysia and in the countries where the migrant workers are recruited .
comprehensive policy needed gabriel explained that the problem had been exacerbated by a new policy : " one of the latest problems that cropped up last year was the fact that bangladeshi workers , who now come under a new policy called the ' outsourcing policy ' -lrb- where the recruitment of labour for foreign workers is out-sourced to private companies -rrb- met with so many problems because there was more demand than supply . "
" workers came into malaysia without a clear indication of a guaranteed job .
many of them were left stranded either at airports or were kept away in houses or shop lots by employers and were not actually given jobs .
there have been many cases of migrants being cheated of their money and of a decent job . "
caram asia and other ngos working with migrant workers have called for a comprehensive policy about migrant recruitment to be put in place by the malaysian government .
they say ministries should work together to establish clear protection mechanisms for foreign migrant workers both at recruitment level and when they are in employment . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic rights groups call for comprensive governmental policy 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 09.01.2008 wikia launches search engine , challenges google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take a lot of time , if wikia is ever to rival google wikipedia founder jimmy wales has unveiled his rival platform , wikia search , for navigating the web .
but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .
" users will rate their own websites as best so that they appear at the top of the index .
wikia search is not a serious competitor for google .
it will more likely be a means of earning even more money . " christian gies -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

six people were formally arrested , while five others were detained for investigation and one other person was still being sought .

" over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .

he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .

rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .

with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .
it would good if voters in the remaining 48 states looked beyond made-for-tv moments of sentiment and did some serious thinking about whether clinton or obama has more to offer america and the world . jefferson chase works for dw-tv and dw-world.de. send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , says dw 's christina bergmann , may have been the key to her comeback - especially among democratic women . hillary clinton may have only bested rival barack obama by two percent , but her win in the new hampshire primary has huge implications for the new york senator 's campaign to win the democratic nomination for president . polls predicted an obama victory .
but predictions do n't decide what voters actually do with their ballots .
many only decide which candidate to support just before they go to polling stations . hillary clinton knows all about the perils of being the favorite .
for months , she was considered the frontrunner for the democratic nomination , only to get a nasty surprise in the iowa democratic caucus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in iowa , barack obama succeeded in attracting the most support among female voters , and he also pulled in a lot of independent and crossover votes from republicans . clinton 's campaign strategy was in shambles , and the sudden disintegration of her support led to an emotional moment in which the senator seemed to be choking back tears . showing weakness is usually a faux pas in politics , and her competitor john edwards could n't help but sneer that an american president was not allowed to engage such emotional displays . but new hampshire women did n't see expressing feelings as a weakness .
and despite speculation in the media about whether clinton 's wobbly moment was staged or not , female voters clearly believed hillary and gave her - and not obama - their support . what woman has n't had to fight back tears of rage , despair , frustration , disappointment or simple exhaustion ?
men may see that as weakness ; women do n't . whatever you think of hillary clinton , the new hampshire result puts her back in the race , which is a good thing .
her campaign did n't deserve to crash and burn before it had ever really got off the ground . that 's the real message that was sent by new hampshire 's female voters . the campaign for a democratic nomination now continues .
the voters , male and female , will now get a chance to decide whether a woman or an african-american will get the chance to become america 's next president . christina bergmann is dw-radio 's washington correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- survey pinpoints iraq , bush as main reasons for us-eu rift a new poll has found that us-eu ties are unlikely to recover even after the election of a new american president next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.01.2008 german expert : bush waited too long with mideast trip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he achieve something once he gets down ?
as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .

what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .
the result was an immediate rise in share prices for germany 's largest pay-tv operator .
it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .
" pay tv is one of the central focuses of murdoch 's news corp , " media business expert adam bird told the online version of germany 's spiegel magazine .
" with bskyb , he 's one of the most successful pay-tv operators in the world , and he showed with sky italia that he can turn around difficult situations , " bird said .
helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's rtl tv station told the on-line version of stern magazine that murdoch might be giving the german market a second chance .

" by getting into premiere , murdoch is acquiring another platform to market the media products produced by news corp , " media analyst larry witt told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
premiere 's flagship product is bundesliga soccer .
last season , the station lost a bidding war to rivals arena for the rights to broadcast league matches live .
but arena proved unable to master the logistics and were forced , in essence , to turn responsibility for telecasting the games back over to premiere , cementing the relationship between the station and germany 's most popular sport .

only 4.2 million germans have premiere , and a far lower percentage of the german population uses pay-tv services than in other countries .

companies have apparently chosen to disregard calls for international sanctions , according to a german business paper . germany imported 580 million euros -lrb- $ 853 million -rrb- worth of goods from iran in 2007 , a 50 percent increase over the previous year , the german business daily handelsblatt reported on wednesday , jan.9 , citing sources in the german foreign trade agency . the jump indicates a deliberate move in the german economy to resist us appeals to trim down trade with the islamic republic , said the paper .
the us demand for a cutback in trade came in addition to united nations sanctions . the us had threatened german banks with sanctions on the american market if they did not in turn put economic pressure on iran to cease its nuclear program .
germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank have complied . the united nations has called on iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program , which the west has said tehran is using to develop a nuclear bomb . iran has said it will not halt its nuclear program , which it insists serves only non-military purposes . red tape hinders exports to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has insisted that the nuclear program is purely civilian though german wholesalers and retailers bought significantly more iranian products last year , german sales to the country dropped . exports to iran dropped by 15 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
in contrast , exports to countries outside the euro zone rose 13.7 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006 -lrb- january through november -rrb- , according to germany 's federal statistical office . in light of the iranian nuclear conflict , the german government has issued significantly fewer export guarantees , particularly for large machinery - one of germany 's most important exports .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 09.01.2008 wikia launches search engine , challenges google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take a lot of time , if wikia is ever to rival google wikipedia founder jimmy wales has unveiled his rival platform , wikia search , for navigating the web .
but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .

but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .
as soon as the market demand comes , though , our students are prepared . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .
as soon as the market demand comes , though , our students are prepared . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .
the result was an immediate rise in share prices for germany 's largest pay-tv operator .
it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .
" pay tv is one of the central focuses of murdoch 's news corp , " media business expert adam bird told the online version of germany 's spiegel magazine .
" with bskyb , he 's one of the most successful pay-tv operators in the world , and he showed with sky italia that he can turn around difficult situations , " bird said .
helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's rtl tv station told the on-line version of stern magazine that murdoch might be giving the german market a second chance .

premiere 's flagship product is bundesliga soccer .
last season , the station lost a bidding war to rivals arena for the rights to broadcast league matches live .

in that situation , the broad offerings of sky were able to be successful .
but in germany there 's a much greater variety of free terrestrial stations so that there not that much left over for pay tv . "

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .
the result was an immediate rise in share prices for germany 's largest pay-tv operator .
it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .

only 4.2 million germans have premiere , and a far lower percentage of the german population uses pay-tv services than in other countries .
" they have different television structures , " helmut thoma told stern online .
" in britain , there were only four or five channels before pay tv came along .
in that situation , the broad offerings of sky were able to be successful .
but in germany there 's a much greater variety of free terrestrial stations so that there not that much left over for pay tv . "
premier has rarely made money in the past , and many years it lost millions .
murdoch may , however , have been encouraged by the fact that the station was slightly in the black for the third quarter of 2007 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .

he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .

companies have apparently chosen to disregard calls for international sanctions , according to a german business paper . germany imported 580 million euros -lrb- $ 853 million -rrb- worth of goods from iran in 2007 , a 50 percent increase over the previous year , the german business daily handelsblatt reported on wednesday , jan.9 , citing sources in the german foreign trade agency . the jump indicates a deliberate move in the german economy to resist us appeals to trim down trade with the islamic republic , said the paper .
the us demand for a cutback in trade came in addition to united nations sanctions . the us had threatened german banks with sanctions on the american market if they did not in turn put economic pressure on iran to cease its nuclear program .
germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank have complied . the united nations has called on iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program , which the west has said tehran is using to develop a nuclear bomb . iran has said it will not halt its nuclear program , which it insists serves only non-military purposes . red tape hinders exports to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has insisted that the nuclear program is purely civilian though german wholesalers and retailers bought significantly more iranian products last year , german sales to the country dropped . exports to iran dropped by 15 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
in contrast , exports to countries outside the euro zone rose 13.7 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006 -lrb- january through november -rrb- , according to germany 's federal statistical office . in light of the iranian nuclear conflict , the german government has issued significantly fewer export guarantees , particularly for large machinery - one of germany 's most important exports . " exports are so burdened by bureaucratic obstacles that they are breaking down , " jens nagel , head of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , told handelsblatt .

germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank have complied . the united nations has called on iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program , which the west has said tehran is using to develop a nuclear bomb . iran has said it will not halt its nuclear program , which it insists serves only non-military purposes . red tape hinders exports to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has insisted that the nuclear program is purely civilian though german wholesalers and retailers bought significantly more iranian products last year , german sales to the country dropped . exports to iran dropped by 15 percent to 3.5 billion euros .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .

it later expanded to include the claims about prostitutes and sex parties being financed with company funds . german judges decided in late 2007 to begin a new enquiry after an unidentified former employee said piech was informed of the practices in the mid-1990s and had ordered an internal investigation . hartz has maintained that he was solely responsible for authorizing the payments , telling the court that he told piech only in " an informal manner " in 1994 of volkert 's demands to be paid better but emphasized that " details were not mentioned , " according to afp news agency . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .
" that is populism , not policy . "
the president of the central council of jews , charlotte knobloch on wednesday , jan .

the winner of an ebay auction will get a chance to be the coach of a german club for one day - and help save the team from bankruptcy . it could be a lucky break for the highest bidder .
and the broke german soccer club kfc uerdingen is hoping it 'll be their big break too - out of insolvency . since declaring bankruptcy in december , the regional fourth division team from krefeld has been picking its brain for ways to keep its head above water - and its 22 feet on the field .
legally speaking , it has until the end of january to do so before the insolvency process continues . according to the team 's ebay listing , the winner of the auction will over a 24-hour period experience " all the joys coaching has to offer . "
from the sound of things , it 's more like a whole coaching career in a day . on jan .
19 , he -lrb- or she -rrb- will introduce themselves to the players as the new coach before leading the former bundesliga team through a friendly game against rot weiß oberhausen with the help of real-life coach aleksandar ristic . " whether you 're an old school drill sergeant , an introverted tactical fox , an emotional motivator or a completely different kind of coach is entirely up to you , " reads the ad . guest coach 's fate already written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team is short some 250,000 euros , said chairman ralf houben following the match , the ebay winner will learn of his -lrb- or her -rrb- dismissal , according to the listing , and " be left searching for words " like many a formerly great coach in the sport 's history . it may seem rather unfair that the dismissal has been planned before the new coach has even had a chance to strut his -lrb- or her -rrb- stuff .
but we 're assuming that kfc uerdingen is more interested in their fans ' pay pal accounts than coaching abilities - and that it 's the ebay coach who 'll get the pink slip after the game and not ristic . this is n't the first time the 1985 german cup winners have taken their chances with amateurs in favor of staying in the black .
two year ago , a 33-year-old insurance salesman bought a temporary spot on the team for three minutes of glory on the field during a friendly game against bayern munich . with a little over six days to go in the auction , the highest bidder on at 6:30 p.m. local time on wednesday , jan .
9 , was willing to pay 815 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- for the dream job .
seems like the club could still do with a bit more money . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 09.01.2008 german cars do n't deserve dirty reputation , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's clearly greener german cars than this classic vw bulli bus by now are german car makers doing enough to keep up with consumer tastes ?
or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .
as soon as the market demand comes , though , our students are prepared . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .

the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .
" it will take significant time before the evaluation systems deliver a number of quality search results , " keuichel said .
user rankings versus algorithms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales ' wikipedia has established itself alongside traditional reference sources wikia boss jimmy wales thinks his search engine has a decisive advantage over google in that the process used to decide the ranking of hits will be transparent and open to influence by users .
" we expect wikia search to be like fine wine in that it will get better and better as time goes by and more and more people contribute , " wales told reuters news agency , when the alpha program was unveiled .
" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "
google counters that its algorithm-based ranking system is a great strength .
" we revolutionized the market ten years ago with this process , and it 's used by everyone else , " keuchel said .
" for us , it 's the best way to reach the masses .
and in any case every algorithm has to be written by someone .
robots do n't make them - very , very intelligent people do .
so it 's hard to understand this argument by mr. wales . "
in wikia search , individual users are asked to rank the quality of the hits .
it 's a web 2.0 approach familiar from wales ' on-line , user-generated reference source wikipedia .
but some analysts are unimpressed , disputing the idea that this approach will lead to more fairness and transparency .
" it is n't that great a feature , " sander-beuermann said .
" users will rate their own websites as best so that they appear at the top of the index .
wikia search is not a serious competitor for google .
it will more likely be a means of earning even more money . " christian gies -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .

it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .

then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .
as soon as the market demand comes , though , our students are prepared . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .

this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .
the result was an immediate rise in share prices for germany 's largest pay-tv operator .
it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .
" pay tv is one of the central focuses of murdoch 's news corp , " media business expert adam bird told the online version of germany 's spiegel magazine .
" with bskyb , he 's one of the most successful pay-tv operators in the world , and he showed with sky italia that he can turn around difficult situations , " bird said .
helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's rtl tv station told the on-line version of stern magazine that murdoch might be giving the german market a second chance .
" perhaps he just wanted to stick his toe in the water again to see if something could be developed , " he said .
close relationship with the bundesliga bildunterschrift : the bundesliga is premiere 's main attraction other experts said that the deal makes sense because it will allow murdoch to sell his other wares .
" by getting into premiere , murdoch is acquiring another platform to market the media products produced by news corp , " media analyst larry witt told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
premiere 's flagship product is bundesliga soccer .
last season , the station lost a bidding war to rivals arena for the rights to broadcast league matches live .
but arena proved unable to master the logistics and were forced , in essence , to turn responsibility for telecasting the games back over to premiere , cementing the relationship between the station and germany 's most popular sport .
" the past has shown that -lsb- live football -rsb- does n't work without premiere , " media analyst friedrich schellmoser told spiegel online .
uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch has the analysts guessing with his latest move but despite the positives , experts feel that murdoch will struggle to raise the profile of premiere in germany .
only 4.2 million germans have premiere , and a far lower percentage of the german population uses pay-tv services than in other countries .
" they have different television structures , " helmut thoma told stern online .
" in britain , there were only four or five channels before pay tv came along .
in that situation , the broad offerings of sky were able to be successful .
but in germany there 's a much greater variety of free terrestrial stations so that there not that much left over for pay tv . "
premier has rarely made money in the past , and many years it lost millions .
murdoch may , however , have been encouraged by the fact that the station was slightly in the black for the third quarter of 2007 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , says dw 's christina bergmann , may have been the key to her comeback - especially among democratic women . hillary clinton may have only bested rival barack obama by two percent , but her win in the new hampshire primary has huge implications for the new york senator 's campaign to win the democratic nomination for president . polls predicted an obama victory .
but predictions do n't decide what voters actually do with their ballots .
many only decide which candidate to support just before they go to polling stations . hillary clinton knows all about the perils of being the favorite .
for months , she was considered the frontrunner for the democratic nomination , only to get a nasty surprise in the iowa democratic caucus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in iowa , barack obama succeeded in attracting the most support among female voters , and he also pulled in a lot of independent and crossover votes from republicans . clinton 's campaign strategy was in shambles , and the sudden disintegration of her support led to an emotional moment in which the senator seemed to be choking back tears . showing weakness is usually a faux pas in politics , and her competitor john edwards could n't help but sneer that an american president was not allowed to engage such emotional displays . but new hampshire women did n't see expressing feelings as a weakness .
and despite speculation in the media about whether clinton 's wobbly moment was staged or not , female voters clearly believed hillary and gave her - and not obama - their support . what woman has n't had to fight back tears of rage , despair , frustration , disappointment or simple exhaustion ?
men may see that as weakness ; women do n't . whatever you think of hillary clinton , the new hampshire result puts her back in the race , which is a good thing .
her campaign did n't deserve to crash and burn before it had ever really got off the ground . that 's the real message that was sent by new hampshire 's female voters . the campaign for a democratic nomination now continues .
the voters , male and female , will now get a chance to decide whether a woman or an african-american will get the chance to become america 's next president . christina bergmann is dw-radio 's washington correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many only decide which candidate to support just before they go to polling stations . hillary clinton knows all about the perils of being the favorite .
for months , she was considered the frontrunner for the democratic nomination , only to get a nasty surprise in the iowa democratic caucus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in iowa , barack obama succeeded in attracting the most support among female voters , and he also pulled in a lot of independent and crossover votes from republicans . clinton 's campaign strategy was in shambles , and the sudden disintegration of her support led to an emotional moment in which the senator seemed to be choking back tears . showing weakness is usually a faux pas in politics , and her competitor john edwards could n't help but sneer that an american president was not allowed to engage such emotional displays . but new hampshire women did n't see expressing feelings as a weakness .
and despite speculation in the media about whether clinton 's wobbly moment was staged or not , female voters clearly believed hillary and gave her - and not obama - their support . what woman has n't had to fight back tears of rage , despair , frustration , disappointment or simple exhaustion ?
men may see that as weakness ; women do n't . whatever you think of hillary clinton , the new hampshire result puts her back in the race , which is a good thing .
her campaign did n't deserve to crash and burn before it had ever really got off the ground . that 's the real message that was sent by new hampshire 's female voters . the campaign for a democratic nomination now continues .
the voters , male and female , will now get a chance to decide whether a woman or an african-american will get the chance to become america 's next president . christina bergmann is dw-radio 's washington correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2008 opinion : mawkish moments have replaced reason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton 's victory in the new hampshire primary is being put down to her display of " genuine " emotion .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .
" yet again , politicians try to find quick solutions instead of analyzing the causes , " kramer told german news agency ddp .

and that , says dw 's christina bergmann , may have been the key to her comeback - especially among democratic women . hillary clinton may have only bested rival barack obama by two percent , but her win in the new hampshire primary has huge implications for the new york senator 's campaign to win the democratic nomination for president . polls predicted an obama victory .
but predictions do n't decide what voters actually do with their ballots .

and despite speculation in the media about whether clinton 's wobbly moment was staged or not , female voters clearly believed hillary and gave her - and not obama - their support . what woman has n't had to fight back tears of rage , despair , frustration , disappointment or simple exhaustion ?
men may see that as weakness ; women do n't . whatever you think of hillary clinton , the new hampshire result puts her back in the race , which is a good thing .
her campaign did n't deserve to crash and burn before it had ever really got off the ground . that 's the real message that was sent by new hampshire 's female voters . the campaign for a democratic nomination now continues .

the winner of an ebay auction will get a chance to be the coach of a german club for one day - and help save the team from bankruptcy . it could be a lucky break for the highest bidder .
and the broke german soccer club kfc uerdingen is hoping it 'll be their big break too - out of insolvency . since declaring bankruptcy in december , the regional fourth division team from krefeld has been picking its brain for ways to keep its head above water - and its 22 feet on the field .
legally speaking , it has until the end of january to do so before the insolvency process continues . according to the team 's ebay listing , the winner of the auction will over a 24-hour period experience " all the joys coaching has to offer . "
from the sound of things , it 's more like a whole coaching career in a day . on jan .
19 , he -lrb- or she -rrb- will introduce themselves to the players as the new coach before leading the former bundesliga team through a friendly game against rot weiß oberhausen with the help of real-life coach aleksandar ristic . " whether you 're an old school drill sergeant , an introverted tactical fox , an emotional motivator or a completely different kind of coach is entirely up to you , " reads the ad . guest coach 's fate already written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team is short some 250,000 euros , said chairman ralf houben following the match , the ebay winner will learn of his -lrb- or her -rrb- dismissal , according to the listing , and " be left searching for words " like many a formerly great coach in the sport 's history . it may seem rather unfair that the dismissal has been planned before the new coach has even had a chance to strut his -lrb- or her -rrb- stuff .
but we 're assuming that kfc uerdingen is more interested in their fans ' pay pal accounts than coaching abilities - and that it 's the ebay coach who 'll get the pink slip after the game and not ristic . this is n't the first time the 1985 german cup winners have taken their chances with amateurs in favor of staying in the black .
two year ago , a 33-year-old insurance salesman bought a temporary spot on the team for three minutes of glory on the field during a friendly game against bayern munich . with a little over six days to go in the auction , the highest bidder on at 6:30 p.m. local time on wednesday , jan .
9 , was willing to pay 815 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- for the dream job .
seems like the club could still do with a bit more money . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .

" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .

at a conference of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in hamburg , schröder lashed out at koch 's verbal attack on foreigners and his calls for deporting " criminal foreigners " as he struggles to seek a third consecutive term as leader of hesse .
counter-attack koch 's statements have been supported by some members of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which governs with the spd in a grand coalition at the federal level , and merkel too has not publicly reined in the 49-year-old .
she has called the debate on juvenile crime a necessary one and supported conservative calls to tighten laws .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy schröder , who is still a prominent figure in the spd , accused merkel for ignoring the mounting neo-nazi attacks on foreigners in germany .
" young german far-rightists commit on the average three violent acts a day - mostly against people with other skin color , " schröder was quoted as saying .
" you wo n't hear anything about that ... from mrs. merkel . "
koch seized on a violent attack by two young immigrants on a 76-year-old pensioner on a munich subway over the holiday period to make crime , in particular offences by youths from immigrant backgrounds , the centerpiece of his campaign .
" how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild last week .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . "
jewish group slams koch schröder 's criticism of koch , who has used the anti-foreigner card in previous campaigns too , was echoed by germany 's jewish community this week .
stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , said koch was using the same slogans as the far-right anti-immigrant npd party of germany .
" the standard of premier roland koch 's election campaign hardly differs from that of the npd , " kramer said .
" it is irresponsible when a politician plays with fire . "
kramer also criticized koch 's calls for tougher sentencing of juvenile criminals by courts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2008 opinion : mawkish moments have replaced reason großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton 's victory in the new hampshire primary is being put down to her display of " genuine " emotion .
dw-world.de 's jefferson chase says this is a further example of us politics descending into self-parody . " over the last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , " new york senator hillary clinton said after pulling off her narrow comeback win over barack obama in the new hampshire democratic primary . but what sort of voice is it ?
with clinton 's victory partly being attributed to the sympathy she garnered from a televised moment in which she seemed near tears , the answer is apparently : a maudlin one . the history of american politics is dotted with moments of empty sentiment designed to tug at the heart-strings - from richard nixon 's mushy " checkers " speech in 1952 to the saccharine " man from hope " ad campaign that helped get bill clinton elected four decades later . but the apparent effectiveness of hillary clinton 's misty-eyed moment reinforces the impression that soap-opera sentimentalism is the dominant force in american politics .
can it really be true that a candidate can win over an electorate by telling them " if you do n't vote for me , i 'm gonna cry ? " the president occupies a unique position in american culture .
he or she is the only politician with whom citizens compulsively need to identify .
that gives the presidency a power far in excess of any of the state responsibilities sent aside in the constitution for the office . emotions will always play a role in an election .
the disturbing implication of the new hampshire spectacle is that they may have tipped the balance over rational considerations such as what a given candidate says he or she is going to do , or how well he or she seems likely to deal with the pressure of the job . if getting to know the " human side " of the candidates is to become be-all and end-all of american presidential politics , why not just put them all in a big-brother-style container and let viewers vote them out one at a time ? it 's an absurd scenario - but one that underscores the increasingly surreal quality of us elections . there has been speculation about whether clinton 's emotional moment might have been staged , but who really cares ?
rather than looking for " genuine " moments of emotion in the lives of candidates , the us electorate and the us media would be better served searching for genuine ideas about where america should be headed and genuine strategies for realizing those goals . realism is all the more important in this election since americans are choosing a successor to a president who often prioritized faith over analysis .
that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .
it would good if voters in the remaining 48 states looked beyond made-for-tv moments of sentiment and did some serious thinking about whether clinton or obama has more to offer america and the world . jefferson chase works for dw-tv and dw-world.de. send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that president now enjoys record low levels of public approval , making it all the more curious that the electorate in the new hampshire primary seems to have reverted to a tendency of feeling first , thinking second . a few pundits are putting a feminist spin on clinton 's comeback .
but the idea that the new hampshire vote reflects modern , liberated women 's endorsement of " female " emotionalism is counter-intuitive - and probably vaguely offensive to many feminists . whatever the case may be , the race for the democratic nomination is shaping up to be a two-candidate affair .
it would good if voters in the remaining 48 states looked beyond made-for-tv moments of sentiment and did some serious thinking about whether clinton or obama has more to offer america and the world . jefferson chase works for dw-tv and dw-world.de. send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .

with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .

for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .

" i 've said before that internet searches must be more open and transparent , and today marks a major milestone in our mission to make it just that . "

but does it work ?
dw-world asked experts on both sides and did some sample searches .
the results were mixed . it 's a david and goliath story .
with the launch of the wikia search engine , entrepreneur jimmy wales is taking on industry giant google , which currently enjoys a 90 market share .
the new search engine uses web 2.0 components and touts - in contrast to google - an open algorithm for greater transparency about how the order in which the results appear is determined .
google is taking the arrival of a new competitor in stride .
" we expressly welcome the fact that wikia search has now joined google and the other competitors in germany and other countries , " stefan keuchel , press spokesman for google germany , told dw-world.de.
" there 's room enough for more than one provider .
both the market as a whole and users profit from competition .
we and others will have to move ahead with innovations . "
but some specialists question how innovative wikia search 's software is .
" " this project uses so-called grub software , something that was mothballed a few years ago and has now been revived , " independent it scientist wolfgang sauer-beuermann told dw-world.de.
" the only thing that 's new is the name . "
taking wikia out for a spin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jimmy wales is convinced the project will work wikia search 's biggest problem will probably be overcoming google 's massive head start .
the search giant has been in existence since 1998 , whereas the wikia company was only founded in 2004 .
tests of the alpha version of wikia search instantly reveal some shortcomings .
the new engine encompasses only 50-100 million websites , compared with the 10 billion claimed by google .
for example , when dw searched wikia for " bundesliga , " it only yielded two hits for germany 's professional soccer league - a commercial page and a weblog .
likewise a search for " troja " - the german word for " troy " - resulted in advertisements , instead of entries on the ancient greek city or references to homer 's iliad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 09.01.2008 german cars do n't deserve dirty reputation , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's clearly greener german cars than this classic vw bulli bus by now are german car makers doing enough to keep up with consumer tastes ?
or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .
as soon as the market demand comes , though , our students are prepared . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts split on best way to get cleaner cars on europe 's roads europeans are struggling to find the best way to get high-pollutant cars off the streets .
while some countries bank on cash incentives , some german car experts believe there are better ways to go .
-lrb- 11.12.2007 -rrb- germany plans tax exemption for low-emission cars car-buyers are to be rewarded with a tax exemption in the future for selecting environmentally friendly vehicles , germany 's finance ministry said tuesday , nov .
13 .
-lrb- 14.11.2007 -rrb- heavy german cars pollute more than european competition the average carbon dioxide emission level in new german cars has increased , making them the dirtiest in europe .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .

or should they be setting an example ?
dw-world.de spoke with an expert on the industry 's current approach to environmentally friendly vehicle design . henning wallentowitz has chaired the institute for automotive engineering -lrb- ika -rrb- at germany 's elite rwth university in aachen since 1993 .
in a conversation with dw-world.de ahead of the detroit auto show , which opens saturday , jan .
19 , he explained why german cars are small enough , and why engineers are waiting for consumers to set the pace for further green development .
dw-world.de : environmentally friendly auto design is going to be another hot-button issue again at this year 's detroit motor show - will german manufacturers have something to offer ?
henning wallentowitz : at the detroit motor show there will be some interestingly designed cars , and also some environmental cars .
german industry will be there with a bluetec car from daimler ; it 's a diesel with a special additive to make it less polluting . then general motors and opel have an ecoflex - an electric engine with combustion engine that could use biofuel , diesel or a pure fuel cell .
i think in the future we are going to see hybrid technology used not only for fuel-efficient cars , but for powerful , fun to drive cars as well .
a former bmw executive was quoted by the wall street journal as saying germany had " slept through " the hybrid revolution .
is this the case ?
no , that is absolutely untrue .
in 1992 my institute started introducing hybrid facilities , so we could run and test hybrid and electric vehicles on the grid here .
we made the first ford hybrid , in ' 93 , and gave it to america .
but the market was not there to sell hybrids .
not just in germany , but in all of europe .
there is still no market .
why are n't they selling here now ?
in the us it seems hybrid cars are constantly in the news .
the japanese are selling hybrids in america .
but we are quite sure they do n't earn money with them .
the price for those cars is too cheap to make a profit .
some people in america have made hybrids into a cause ; from what i hear it is a lot of artists and actors .
but hybrids make up just one percent of the market .
and that is n't going to change in the near future .
now , all the german companies are working on hybrids , because society is beginning to request it .
we 'll see how it develops .
so are hybrids the cars of the future ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in detroit , some german makers will be pushing bluetec diesel cars the problem with hybrids is you have more weight , and you have a battery in the car .
and battery technology is still not developed enough … .
in the end you have to wonder how many people will really buy a hybrid .
in germany , car makers already tried " eco-cars " five years ago , the eco golf and the eco polo -lrb- from vw -rrb- .
they had three-liter fuel consumption .
but it was n't a success , it was a disaster .
they did n't sell .
the cars were more expensive .
there was more technological equipment needed , and the customers did n't like it .
and they were n't powerful enough .
people will want cars that behave in the same way as their old cars , and wo n't accept any changes .
how are stricter european regulations on lowering co2 emissions affecting german carmakers ' development decisions ?
one of the most certain ways to reduce co2 and meet the newer eu standards is to lower fuel consumption .
now we just need to convince consumers to drive these optimized cars .
when fuel was cheaper , the controllers in the car companies would n't allow for design costs aimed at lowering fuel consumption .
designing a car is n't just a question of technological ability .
it is also a question of profitability .
but with higher fuel costs , this has changed .
it 's a very interesting time for engineers because we can work on ideas we came up with years ago .
i 'm very confident that we will fulfill european co2 emissions requirements .
what kind of changes might car buyers be looking at ?
the first changes will appear in the engines - low-volume engines with high pressure and supercharging are replacing high-volume engines .
then there is cylinder deactivation ; gearbox design can reduce fuel consumption dramatically - we have to tell drivers when to shift , or make an automated gear shift .
then there is dynamic aerodynamic design , lightweight design ; and maybe hybrids , or auxilaries like power steering , could be operated on demand by electric drives .
it already is in some german cars .
our institute modified a vw golf for the frankfurt motor show .
it originally emitted 171 grams of co2 per kilometer , and using already existing technologies we got it down to 131 grams per kilometer .
and we have n't even exhausted our possibilities yet .
i 'm confident our german cars will be on the road in the future .
what do you say to people who argue that the best way to reduce co2 output is simply to drive smaller cars ?
i think the people who are demanding smaller cars do n't know the difference between driving in a larger or a small car .
a larger car is much more comfortable and much safer than a smaller car .
it 's not only fuel economy , but also other features that guide people to buy german cars .
french and italian cars may be closer to meeting the european limits set on co2 emissions , but that 's only because of their small size .
those cars are good for transport , but they are just not fun to drive .
so you do n't see a problem with germany 's apparent determination to continue producing big , heavy cars ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallentowitz : " the engineers are ready , and waiting for consumers . "
you have to remember - we have made a lot of headway on fuel efficiency and emissions over the past 30 years .
i do n't think we are as bad as everyone says .
thirty years ago we had 10 times more emissions than today .
if you compare european regulations from 15 years ago to today , the change has been immense , especially if you look at nitrogen emissions and carbon monoxide emissions .
we have environmentally friendly cars already .
people just do n't want to recognize it .
we engineers joke that in some countries , the air coming out of the exhaust system is better than the air going into the engine .
i do n't think you can kill yourself anymore by shutting yourself in a garage and letting the car engine run .
why do the german carmakers continue to fight regulators on meeting co2 emissions targets ?
it makes for some bad pr .
well , it may not be very clever of them in terms of publicity .
but then again if you only have a single -lrb- co2 output -rrb- figure that applies to all cars in europe , and you do n't differentiate between smaller cars and heavier cars , then the whole problem lands on the shoulders of the heavier cars .
the german car industry wants there to be a certain scale , so that heavier cars can have more relaxed conditions .
by having one emissions figure apply to all car companies , you force your customer to buy something other than he wants .
you run one of germany 's top engineering departments .
is " green " design an important topic in engineering education ?
i 'd have to answer that with a very loud " yes . "
we have a special lecture on this topic - and we are ready to experiment with and develop electric and hybrid vehicles , and fuel-cell vehicles that we can handle with hydrogen in the lab .
but as long as there is no market demand , it is very slow .

and that , says dw 's christina bergmann , may have been the key to her comeback - especially among democratic women . hillary clinton may have only bested rival barack obama by two percent , but her win in the new hampshire primary has huge implications for the new york senator 's campaign to win the democratic nomination for president . polls predicted an obama victory .
but predictions do n't decide what voters actually do with their ballots .
many only decide which candidate to support just before they go to polling stations . hillary clinton knows all about the perils of being the favorite .
for months , she was considered the frontrunner for the democratic nomination , only to get a nasty surprise in the iowa democratic caucus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in iowa , barack obama succeeded in attracting the most support among female voters , and he also pulled in a lot of independent and crossover votes from republicans . clinton 's campaign strategy was in shambles , and the sudden disintegration of her support led to an emotional moment in which the senator seemed to be choking back tears . showing weakness is usually a faux pas in politics , and her competitor john edwards could n't help but sneer that an american president was not allowed to engage such emotional displays . but new hampshire women did n't see expressing feelings as a weakness .
and despite speculation in the media about whether clinton 's wobbly moment was staged or not , female voters clearly believed hillary and gave her - and not obama - their support . what woman has n't had to fight back tears of rage , despair , frustration , disappointment or simple exhaustion ?
men may see that as weakness ; women do n't . whatever you think of hillary clinton , the new hampshire result puts her back in the race , which is a good thing .
her campaign did n't deserve to crash and burn before it had ever really got off the ground . that 's the real message that was sent by new hampshire 's female voters . the campaign for a democratic nomination now continues .
the voters , male and female , will now get a chance to decide whether a woman or an african-american will get the chance to become america 's next president . christina bergmann is dw-radio 's washington correspondent -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

companies have apparently chosen to disregard calls for international sanctions , according to a german business paper . germany imported 580 million euros -lrb- $ 853 million -rrb- worth of goods from iran in 2007 , a 50 percent increase over the previous year , the german business daily handelsblatt reported on wednesday , jan.9 , citing sources in the german foreign trade agency . the jump indicates a deliberate move in the german economy to resist us appeals to trim down trade with the islamic republic , said the paper .
the us demand for a cutback in trade came in addition to united nations sanctions . the us had threatened german banks with sanctions on the american market if they did not in turn put economic pressure on iran to cease its nuclear program .
germany 's commerzbank and deutsche bank have complied . the united nations has called on iran to suspend its uranium enrichment program , which the west has said tehran is using to develop a nuclear bomb . iran has said it will not halt its nuclear program , which it insists serves only non-military purposes . red tape hinders exports to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president has insisted that the nuclear program is purely civilian though german wholesalers and retailers bought significantly more iranian products last year , german sales to the country dropped . exports to iran dropped by 15 percent to 3.5 billion euros .
in contrast , exports to countries outside the euro zone rose 13.7 percent in 2007 as compared to 2006 -lrb- january through november -rrb- , according to germany 's federal statistical office . in light of the iranian nuclear conflict , the german government has issued significantly fewer export guarantees , particularly for large machinery - one of germany 's most important exports . " exports are so burdened by bureaucratic obstacles that they are breaking down , " jens nagel , head of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , told handelsblatt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.01.2008 german expert : bush waited too long with mideast trip großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he achieve something once he gets down ?
as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .

as us president george w. bush embarks on a multi-country tour of the middle east , a prominent german expert says that his chances to achieve something are fairly slim . middle east expert udo steinbach until recently headed the giga institute of middle east studies in hamburg .
he is now a professor at the center for near and middle eastern studies at marburg university .
dw-world.de : what 's the point of president bush 's visit to israel ?
is it just a symbolic visit or can bush actually still achieve something ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo steinbach is one of germany 's leading middle east experts udo steinbach : well , the us president at least wants to show that he 's now set on solving the biggest problem in the middle east .
we 've waited a long time for him to do something .
then came annapolis .
that was just a mediocre success , and that 's why the president is now trying to break the stalemate .
his chances are n't very good , though .
he 's waited too long and too much has happened in the middle east for this to be resolved in a limited time period .
many arab countries were angry about israel 's settlement policy at the annapolis conference .
will israel make concessions in this regard ?
different signals are coming out of jerusalem in that respect .
the construction of settlements has n't been stopped , but the israeli prime minister has announced that some outposts will be cleared and that no new settlements will be built .
but he 's also said that existing settlements , such as ma 'ale adumim near jerusalem , will be expanded .
one thing is certain : if the american president does not manage to get israel to take a clear stance on this , we can forget about the whole visit .
that would mean that america 's influence on israel is practically zero .
bush will visit saudi arabia , kuwait , bahrain and the united arab emirates , in order to back this arab alliance against iran as the hegemonic power in the region .
what 's your view on the situation ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad -lrb- right -rrb- with arab leaders at the gcc meeting in december that concept has been around for quite some time .
it means that people are trying to form an alliance of the moderate arab states on the one hand , i.e. those present at annapolis , and israel on the other .
but immediately following the return of arab politicians from annapolis , we 've witnessed something very strange and very telling : the iranian president ahmadinejad was invited to the annual meeting of the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- .
this means that the arab states do n't trust the americans ; they do n't have faith in bush 's ability to be successful with his policies .
they choose their own routes and one of them leads them towards iran rather than letting americans dictate a policy of isolating iran .
bush 's standing in egypt , the most important arab country , has fallen .
is there a rapprochement between cairo and tehran ?
what kind of consequences would this have ?
this is a development that 's been going on for a while .
iran and egypt in particular are moving closer together .
this has been blocked again and again and there wo n't be a breakthrough any time soon .
but , again , the american plan to unite the arab world from the gulf to egypt against iran , and especially in an alliance with israel , will not work , especially since relations between washington and cairo have deteriorated in the last couple of years .
there are speculations that bush could visit iraq and lebanon .
what kind of perspectives are there for a post-bush iraq ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even without bush , us soldiers are bound to stay in iraq for quite some time the current american administration is convinced that it moved in the right direction when it increased the troops in iraq last spring .
indeed there 's less violence and the american president could try now to expand the concept to end the conflict in iraq .
we do n't know what would happen under a new administration - especially clinton and obama have sent out different signals .
but one thing is clear : the conflict can not be ended in 24 or 36 months , even under a new administration .
we 'll see how things go with lebanon .
bush 's visit could help to move things along as the country is facing the big problem of electing a new president .
the american influence in beirut could indeed break the current stalemate in this regard .
what 's the legacy of eight years of bush in the arab world ?
a far-reaching chaos .
america 's leadership role , her role as a policing power in the near and middle east , a role that she played over decades , is over .
america has suffered a great loss of confidence , especially among its closest friends .
the fact that arabs are moving closer to iran rather than trusting american protection is telling .
this poses the increased threat of a new chaos originating in iran or the palestinian conflict or lebanon . what can the europeans do ?
the europeans have probably wasted their chances in the last couple of years .
we 've seen for a long time that there 's a vacuum in the middle east that 's been left behind by the united states , the current administration .
europe was called on to fill it , the arabs had expectations .
but it was n't possible to formulate a unified european policy and that 's why we have to be skeptical whether the europeans will manage to achieve what the americans have n't as far as palestinians and israelis are concerned . interview : eva usi -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .
the result was an immediate rise in share prices for germany 's largest pay-tv operator .
it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .
" pay tv is one of the central focuses of murdoch 's news corp , " media business expert adam bird told the online version of germany 's spiegel magazine .
" with bskyb , he 's one of the most successful pay-tv operators in the world , and he showed with sky italia that he can turn around difficult situations , " bird said .
helmut thoma , the former head of germany 's rtl tv station told the on-line version of stern magazine that murdoch might be giving the german market a second chance .

close relationship with the bundesliga bildunterschrift : the bundesliga is premiere 's main attraction other experts said that the deal makes sense because it will allow murdoch to sell his other wares .
" by getting into premiere , murdoch is acquiring another platform to market the media products produced by news corp , " media analyst larry witt told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
premiere 's flagship product is bundesliga soccer .
last season , the station lost a bidding war to rivals arena for the rights to broadcast league matches live .
but arena proved unable to master the logistics and were forced , in essence , to turn responsibility for telecasting the games back over to premiere , cementing the relationship between the station and germany 's most popular sport .

uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch has the analysts guessing with his latest move but despite the positives , experts feel that murdoch will struggle to raise the profile of premiere in germany .
only 4.2 million germans have premiere , and a far lower percentage of the german population uses pay-tv services than in other countries .
" they have different television structures , " helmut thoma told stern online .
" in britain , there were only four or five channels before pay tv came along .
in that situation , the broad offerings of sky were able to be successful .
but in germany there 's a much greater variety of free terrestrial stations so that there not that much left over for pay tv . "

that has experts wondering why the media baron would want to re-invest in a company on which he has previously lost millions . news corp , the global company run by murdoch , announced this week that it had acquired the stake in premiere for 287 million euros -lrb- $ 422.5 million -rrb- .

it 's the second time murdoch has invested in premiere .
in 2002 , murdoch lost millions when the company belonging to the founder of the pay-tv station , german media mogul leo kirch , went bankrupt .
experts think the decision to re-invest reflects murdoch 's abiding confidence in the pay-tv format - even in germany , where it has yet to truly take off .

premiere 's flagship product is bundesliga soccer .

the winner of an ebay auction will get a chance to be the coach of a german club for one day - and help save the team from bankruptcy . it could be a lucky break for the highest bidder .
and the broke german soccer club kfc uerdingen is hoping it 'll be their big break too - out of insolvency . since declaring bankruptcy in december , the regional fourth division team from krefeld has been picking its brain for ways to keep its head above water - and its 22 feet on the field .
legally speaking , it has until the end of january to do so before the insolvency process continues . according to the team 's ebay listing , the winner of the auction will over a 24-hour period experience " all the joys coaching has to offer . "
from the sound of things , it 's more like a whole coaching career in a day . on jan .
19 , he -lrb- or she -rrb- will introduce themselves to the players as the new coach before leading the former bundesliga team through a friendly game against rot weiß oberhausen with the help of real-life coach aleksandar ristic . " whether you 're an old school drill sergeant , an introverted tactical fox , an emotional motivator or a completely different kind of coach is entirely up to you , " reads the ad . guest coach 's fate already written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team is short some 250,000 euros , said chairman ralf houben following the match , the ebay winner will learn of his -lrb- or her -rrb- dismissal , according to the listing , and " be left searching for words " like many a formerly great coach in the sport 's history . it may seem rather unfair that the dismissal has been planned before the new coach has even had a chance to strut his -lrb- or her -rrb- stuff .
but we 're assuming that kfc uerdingen is more interested in their fans ' pay pal accounts than coaching abilities - and that it 's the ebay coach who 'll get the pink slip after the game and not ristic . this is n't the first time the 1985 german cup winners have taken their chances with amateurs in favor of staying in the black .
two year ago , a 33-year-old insurance salesman bought a temporary spot on the team for three minutes of glory on the field during a friendly game against bayern munich . with a little over six days to go in the auction , the highest bidder on at 6:30 p.m. local time on wednesday , jan .
9 , was willing to pay 815 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- for the dream job .
seems like the club could still do with a bit more money . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

home minister radzi sheikh ahmad admitted that the government was trying to reduce the number of foreign workers , but said there was no move to limit the numbers of workers from india specifically . there has been some confusion in malaysia and india this week about conflicting announcements in the media about migrant workers .
cynthia gabriel , the regional co-ordinator for caram asia - a regional network working on migration and health issues - shed some light on the matter .
" the government of malaysia only froze bangladeshi workers from coming into malaysia , " she explained .
" they did not freeze workers coming from other countries .
the announcement yesterday in the newspapers about indian workers now being banned from coming into malaysia was new , a surprise . "
quick denial the announcement coincided with the visit to kuala lumpur of indian defence minister a.k. anthony to discuss defence co-operation .
he returned to india saying the malaysian government had conveyed it wanted to sign a bilateral agreement as soon as possible , regulating employment conditions for indian nationals in malaysia and malaysian nationals in india .
he added that nobody had mentioned there being a ban on indian workers being recruited .
cynthia gabriel from caram asia said the announcement was quickly retracted for fear of exacerbating tension between the two countries : " within 24 hours , there was a denial that was issued saying there was no such thing . "
vital labour force analysts estimate that there are approximately 2.5 million migrant workers in malaysia and at least half are undocumented , or illegal .
they are mainly from indonesia , the philippines , thailand , bangladesh and india .
most of them work in the unskilled and semi-skilled sectors , which are flourishing because of the country 's fast-growing economy .
because malaysians are becoming increasingly reluctant to take up basic jobs , migrant workers are needed but they are often subjected to abuse .
last autumn , the hindu rights action force in malaysia led several protests against what it said were discriminatory government policies against the country 's minority indian population - drawing several thousand participants .
five leaders of the organisation were arrested in december on the grounds that they were threatening " racial and religious harmony among malaysia ’ s malay , chinese , and indian communities " .
they are awaiting trial .
rights violations take place both in malaysia and in the countries where the migrant workers are recruited .
comprehensive policy needed gabriel explained that the problem had been exacerbated by a new policy : " one of the latest problems that cropped up last year was the fact that bangladeshi workers , who now come under a new policy called the ' outsourcing policy ' -lrb- where the recruitment of labour for foreign workers is out-sourced to private companies -rrb- met with so many problems because there was more demand than supply . "
" workers came into malaysia without a clear indication of a guaranteed job .
many of them were left stranded either at airports or were kept away in houses or shop lots by employers and were not actually given jobs .
there have been many cases of migrants being cheated of their money and of a decent job . "
caram asia and other ngos working with migrant workers have called for a comprehensive policy about migrant recruitment to be put in place by the malaysian government .
they say ministries should work together to establish clear protection mechanisms for foreign migrant workers both at recruitment level and when they are in employment . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic rights groups call for comprensive governmental policy 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

home minister radzi sheikh ahmad admitted that the government was trying to reduce the number of foreign workers , but said there was no move to limit the numbers of workers from india specifically . there has been some confusion in malaysia and india this week about conflicting announcements in the media about migrant workers .
cynthia gabriel , the regional co-ordinator for caram asia - a regional network working on migration and health issues - shed some light on the matter .
" the government of malaysia only froze bangladeshi workers from coming into malaysia , " she explained .
" they did not freeze workers coming from other countries .
the announcement yesterday in the newspapers about indian workers now being banned from coming into malaysia was new , a surprise . "
quick denial the announcement coincided with the visit to kuala lumpur of indian defence minister a.k. anthony to discuss defence co-operation .
he returned to india saying the malaysian government had conveyed it wanted to sign a bilateral agreement as soon as possible , regulating employment conditions for indian nationals in malaysia and malaysian nationals in india .
he added that nobody had mentioned there being a ban on indian workers being recruited .

the winner of an ebay auction will get a chance to be the coach of a german club for one day - and help save the team from bankruptcy . it could be a lucky break for the highest bidder .
and the broke german soccer club kfc uerdingen is hoping it 'll be their big break too - out of insolvency . since declaring bankruptcy in december , the regional fourth division team from krefeld has been picking its brain for ways to keep its head above water - and its 22 feet on the field .
legally speaking , it has until the end of january to do so before the insolvency process continues . according to the team 's ebay listing , the winner of the auction will over a 24-hour period experience " all the joys coaching has to offer . "
from the sound of things , it 's more like a whole coaching career in a day . on jan .
19 , he -lrb- or she -rrb- will introduce themselves to the players as the new coach before leading the former bundesliga team through a friendly game against rot weiß oberhausen with the help of real-life coach aleksandar ristic . " whether you 're an old school drill sergeant , an introverted tactical fox , an emotional motivator or a completely different kind of coach is entirely up to you , " reads the ad . guest coach 's fate already written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team is short some 250,000 euros , said chairman ralf houben following the match , the ebay winner will learn of his -lrb- or her -rrb- dismissal , according to the listing , and " be left searching for words " like many a formerly great coach in the sport 's history . it may seem rather unfair that the dismissal has been planned before the new coach has even had a chance to strut his -lrb- or her -rrb- stuff .
but we 're assuming that kfc uerdingen is more interested in their fans ' pay pal accounts than coaching abilities - and that it 's the ebay coach who 'll get the pink slip after the game and not ristic . this is n't the first time the 1985 german cup winners have taken their chances with amateurs in favor of staying in the black .
two year ago , a 33-year-old insurance salesman bought a temporary spot on the team for three minutes of glory on the field during a friendly game against bayern munich . with a little over six days to go in the auction , the highest bidder on at 6:30 p.m. local time on wednesday , jan .
9 , was willing to pay 815 euros -lrb- $ 1,200 -rrb- for the dream job .

alongside a raft of new high definition lcd displays was the world 's largest plasma display - a 150in behemoth from panasonic - the world 's thinnest commercial screen - just 3mm thick - and the world 's first laser television .
the latter was debuted by mitsubishi , a company that has claimed a number of television firsts including the first true high definition sets .
the firm describes its laser technology as a " new category " of screen , in addition to the likes of lcd and plasma displays .
it claims that current high-definition televisions only display 40 % of the colour spectrum the eye can see .
lasers , it says , offer double that .
there is a lot to overcome in terms of physics and the materials stan glasgow , sony " laser is all about light source , " said frank demartin of mitsubishi .
" it 's the purest light source on the planet ; it 's the most intense light source on the planet . "
the 65in sets use three lasers - red , green and blue - that project the image from the rear of the television .
the result is vivid colour and crisp images .
third dimension the firm has not revealed how much the screens will cost but said it will start to ship them to retailers later this year .
other firms have expressed an interest in the technology .
laser television offer crisp images and rich colours " we are studying laser technology but still it is far from commercialisation , " said sang huang shin of samsung .
instead , samsung has decided to focus its efforts on other television technologies .
the korean firm has shown off 3d plasma screens , which it says will be available to consumers in 2008 and will be a world 's first .
the 42in and 50in screens rely on software , running on a pc connected to the screen , and polarised glasses to create the 3d image .
" we can not realise the 3d function without glasses , " said mr shin .
although technologies do exist to produce a 3d experience without the use of spectacles , according to mr shin , they have drawbacks .
" without glasses , eyes quickly become tired , " he said .
bright lights samsung are also showing off their prototype oled displays .
organic light emitting diode -lrb- oled -rrb- televisions are brighter than lcd displays and are ultra thin .
sony introduced the first commercial oled screen last year sony released the first commercial set in october 2007 .
the 11in display was just 3mm thick , including the case .
oled screens are more energy efficient than lcd panels as they do not need a backlight to boost brightness .
" the huge advantage is that it is an emissive material , " said stan glasgow of sony .
" so we are directly putting the colours on the screen . "
but it is difficult and expensive to make large screens using the technology .
sony is showing off a 27in prototype at ces , whilst samsung has a 31in screen .
" it 's very complex - it 's a new technology , " said mr glasgow .
" there is a lot to overcome in terms of physics and the materials . "
the diodes emit a brilliant white light when attached to an electricity supply .
we 're going to be able to recognise who is watching the set by their eyes and change parental controls automatically stan glasgow different organic materials produce different colours and are combined to produce a colour display .
the screens are brighter than lcd panels and also have better contrast ratio - resulting in sharper pictures .
at the moment the televisions are extremely expensive .
sony 's first 11in screen costs £ 850 .
as a result , mr glasgow believes that it will continue to be a niche product for some time .
" it will be the premium television of the future , " he said .
fun walls if and when it finally comes to mass market , the ultra thin televisions will be competing with televisions packed with a range of new features .
panasonic showed off the world 's largest plasma screen " i think we are going to be able to interact with voice and movement , " said mr glasgow .
" we 're going to be able to recognise who is watching the set by their eyes and change parental controls automatically . "
some firms are already showing off prototypes of the technology at ces .
panasonic have demonstrated its interactive life wall which features facial recognition to bring up customised displays and information .
the large scale prototype which is envisaged to take up the entire wall of a room also detects the distance from the viewer to the screen and optimises the size of the image accordingly .
" i think we are gong to see a whole bunch of really consumer friendly applications that will make the tv much more automatic for people . "

alongside a raft of new high definition lcd displays was the world 's largest plasma display - a 150in behemoth from panasonic - the world 's thinnest commercial screen - just 3mm thick - and the world 's first laser television .
the latter was debuted by mitsubishi , a company that has claimed a number of television firsts including the first true high definition sets .
the firm describes its laser technology as a " new category " of screen , in addition to the likes of lcd and plasma displays .
it claims that current high-definition televisions only display 40 % of the colour spectrum the eye can see .
lasers , it says , offer double that .
there is a lot to overcome in terms of physics and the materials stan glasgow , sony " laser is all about light source , " said frank demartin of mitsubishi .
" it 's the purest light source on the planet ; it 's the most intense light source on the planet . "
the 65in sets use three lasers - red , green and blue - that project the image from the rear of the television .
the result is vivid colour and crisp images .
third dimension the firm has not revealed how much the screens will cost but said it will start to ship them to retailers later this year .
other firms have expressed an interest in the technology .
laser television offer crisp images and rich colours " we are studying laser technology but still it is far from commercialisation , " said sang huang shin of samsung .
instead , samsung has decided to focus its efforts on other television technologies .
the korean firm has shown off 3d plasma screens , which it says will be available to consumers in 2008 and will be a world 's first .
the 42in and 50in screens rely on software , running on a pc connected to the screen , and polarised glasses to create the 3d image .
" we can not realise the 3d function without glasses , " said mr shin .
although technologies do exist to produce a 3d experience without the use of spectacles , according to mr shin , they have drawbacks .
" without glasses , eyes quickly become tired , " he said .
bright lights samsung are also showing off their prototype oled displays .
organic light emitting diode -lrb- oled -rrb- televisions are brighter than lcd displays and are ultra thin .
sony introduced the first commercial oled screen last year sony released the first commercial set in october 2007 .
the 11in display was just 3mm thick , including the case .
oled screens are more energy efficient than lcd panels as they do not need a backlight to boost brightness .
" the huge advantage is that it is an emissive material , " said stan glasgow of sony .
" so we are directly putting the colours on the screen . "
but it is difficult and expensive to make large screens using the technology .
sony is showing off a 27in prototype at ces , whilst samsung has a 31in screen .
" it 's very complex - it 's a new technology , " said mr glasgow .
" there is a lot to overcome in terms of physics and the materials . "
the diodes emit a brilliant white light when attached to an electricity supply .
we 're going to be able to recognise who is watching the set by their eyes and change parental controls automatically stan glasgow different organic materials produce different colours and are combined to produce a colour display .
the screens are brighter than lcd panels and also have better contrast ratio - resulting in sharper pictures .
at the moment the televisions are extremely expensive .
sony 's first 11in screen costs £ 850 .
as a result , mr glasgow believes that it will continue to be a niche product for some time .
" it will be the premium television of the future , " he said .
fun walls if and when it finally comes to mass market , the ultra thin televisions will be competing with televisions packed with a range of new features .
panasonic showed off the world 's largest plasma screen " i think we are going to be able to interact with voice and movement , " said mr glasgow .
" we 're going to be able to recognise who is watching the set by their eyes and change parental controls automatically . "
some firms are already showing off prototypes of the technology at ces .
panasonic have demonstrated its interactive life wall which features facial recognition to bring up customised displays and information .
the large scale prototype which is envisaged to take up the entire wall of a room also detects the distance from the viewer to the screen and optimises the size of the image accordingly .

the firm describes its laser technology as a " new category " of screen , in addition to the likes of lcd and plasma displays .
it claims that current high-definition televisions only display 40 % of the colour spectrum the eye can see .
lasers , it says , offer double that .

" it 's the purest light source on the planet ; it 's the most intense light source on the planet . "

oled screens are more energy efficient than lcd panels as they do not need a backlight to boost brightness .
" the huge advantage is that it is an emissive material , " said stan glasgow of sony .
" so we are directly putting the colours on the screen . "

the 42in and 50in screens rely on software , running on a pc connected to the screen , and polarised glasses to create the 3d image .
" we can not realise the 3d function without glasses , " said mr shin .
although technologies do exist to produce a 3d experience without the use of spectacles , according to mr shin , they have drawbacks .
" without glasses , eyes quickly become tired , " he said .
bright lights samsung are also showing off their prototype oled displays .
organic light emitting diode -lrb- oled -rrb- televisions are brighter than lcd displays and are ultra thin .
sony released the first commercial set in october 2007 .
the 11in display was just 3mm thick , including the case .
oled screens are more energy efficient than lcd panels as they do not need a backlight to boost brightness .
" the huge advantage is that it is an emissive material , " said stan glasgow of sony .
" so we are directly putting the colours on the screen . "
but it is difficult and expensive to make large screens using the technology .
sony is showing off a 27in prototype at ces , whilst samsung has a 31in screen .
" it 's very complex - it 's a new technology , " said mr glasgow .
" there is a lot to overcome in terms of physics and the materials . "
the diodes emit a brilliant white light when attached to an electricity supply . "
we 're going to be able to recognise who is watching the set by their eyes and change parental controls automatically " stan glasgow different organic materials produce different colours and are combined to produce a colour display .
the screens are brighter than lcd panels and also have better contrast ratio - resulting in sharper pictures .
at the moment the televisions are extremely expensive .
sony 's first 11in screen costs £ 850 .
as a result , mr glasgow believes that it will continue to be a niche product for some time .
" it will be the premium television of the future , " he said .
fun walls if and when it finally comes to mass market , the ultra thin televisions will be competing with televisions packed with a range of new features .
" i think we are going to be able to interact with voice and movement , " said mr glasgow .
" we 're going to be able to recognise who is watching the set by their eyes and change parental controls automatically . "
some firms are already showing off prototypes of the technology at ces .
panasonic have demonstrated its interactive life wall which features facial recognition to bring up customised displays and information .
the large scale prototype which is envisaged to take up the entire wall of a room also detects the distance from the viewer to the screen and optimises the size of the image accordingly .
" i think we are gong to see a whole bunch of really consumer friendly applications that will make the tv much more automatic for people . "

richard tomlinson claims his 600 organic dairy cows can produce enough waste to provide renewable fuel for those living in holt , near wrexham .
mr tomlinson plans to hold a meeting with villagers to explain how the energy is created by mixing cow slurry and food waste in a generator .
friends of the earth cymru supports the fuel , which is used in mainland europe .
mr tomlinson has yet to apply for planning permission for the generator - called an anaerobic digester - and needs to raise £ 1.2m to build it , which he hopes could come from a low interest loan from the welsh assembly government .
but he said villagers he has spoken to support his plans , and he is hoping his meeting on wednesday will allay any fears others may have about bad smells , which mr tomlinson says are disposed of by the generator .
fuel cost rises he also hopes the welsh assembly government will support him , saying farmers across the country could help wales become a leading country in producing the energy .
" electricity is going up in cost and there 's no doubt that all fuel will continue to go up now , " said mr tomlinson , whose lower park farm , between holt and rossett , has been in his family for 100 years .
" this is a viable alternative and i 'm keen wales leads the way .
after all , we have an agricultural economy and it would provide a valuable income for farmers . "
" this -lsb- fuel -rsb- is already widespread in mainland europe and wales should be looking to do the same " neil crumpton , friends of the earth cymru he said many local authorities use anaerobic digesters to process waste but do not use the energy produced for fuel .
only about 12 generators in the uk are used to produce energy - many to power farms - mr tomlinson said , despite the fact thousands of anaerobic digesters are used in mainland europe , particularly in germany and austria .
in the short-term , he is focusing on gaining planning permission for the anaerobic digester at his farm , which would feed into the national grid and provide enough energy for 500 homes .
he hopes that in future the energy could be pumped directly to houses in holt .
neil crumpton , friends of the earth cymru 's energy campaigner , agreed more needs to be done to encourage uk farmers to produce renewable fuels .
" this -lsb- fuel -rsb- is already widespread in mainland europe and wales should be looking to do the same , " he said .
" but i would say government policy -lsb- in the uk -rsb- is years behind .
they are pro nuclear energy but very slow to promote renewables like this . "

the infection strategy for england includes more infection control nurses , patient screening , deep cleaning and campaign to cut antibiotic use .
however much has been announced already , and experts said there was a long fight ahead to beat the bugs .
mrsa and clostridium difficile rates are now both falling , but still cause thousands of deaths a year .
the strategy pulls together a raft of initiatives which the government has been introducing in recent months , as well as some new schemes .
what are the hospital bugs ?
when the subject of hospital infections crops up it is usually in reference to two - c. difficile and the so-called superbug , mrsa mrsa is a potentially lethal bacterium that causes infections in humans .
it is difficult to combat because it has developed a resistance to certain antibiotics c. difficile is nearly 10 times more common than mrsa , although it is less deadly it is a bacterium found in the gut of some adults and most children c. difficile rarely causes problems , but certain antibiotics can disturb the normal balance , allowing the bug to thrive and causing severe diarrhoea and bowel inflammation quick guide : hospital bugs hospital bugs : hot politics ministers said by 2011 there would be an extra £ 270m a year available for infection control - although that is from an nhs budget which is growing by more than £ 5bn a year in the next three years .
nhs trusts will be able to use this money to appoint specialist nurses to combat infections and phase in mrsa screening from 2009 .
local health bosses and regulators will also be able to fine hospitals that are not doing enough to meet c. difficile targets .
and this is to be coupled with a nationwide campaign starting in february about the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections from the overuse of antibiotics .
ministers also said that a month after the start of the campaign , hospitals should have finished the deep clean programme which was announced last year .
health secretary alan johnson praised the nhs for achieving what was considered impossible in the 1990s - overseeing a fall in mrsa rates .
latest figures from the health protection agency show that mrsa cases fell by 10 % in the most recent three-month period - continuing a downward trend which started in september 2006 .
the figures also showed c. difficile had fallen for the first time , with new cases down 7 % .
mr johnson said there was " still more work to be done " but the government was confident it could continue to curb the threat from both mrsa and c. difficile .
he added : " patients have my assurance that the government will not take its foot off the pedal . "
he also insisted the government was on track to hit its target to halve mrsa rates by the end of march 2008 .
it has been widely assumed this goal will be missed .
isolation leading microbiologist professor hugh pennington , from aberdeen university , said : " the measures being taken will all help , but one of the key things , especially for the screening , is that we have isolation wards available for infected patients .
" i do n't think there is enough capacity for this at the moment and even though the rates look like they are coming down , there is still a long way to go .
" i think it will take another five years before we get our rates down to the best of the other european countries . "
stephen rowling , a senior nurse at university college hospital in london , is involved in a nationwide initiative to improve infection control in hospitals .
he told bbc five live that medical staff were only getting disinfection procedures right half the time .
" we 've rolled this out in a number of hospitals now and the first stage of doing that is auditing wards and hospitals to see how good their practice is - and very typically practice is usually around 50 % good and 50 % not so good and our job is to improve the 50 % , " he said .
jo webber , from the nhs confederation , which represents all trusts and hospitals , stressed different measures were required for different bugs .
for instance , alcohol rubs were effective against mrsa , but soap and water was the best way to reduce the threat of c. difficile .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley agreed isolation facilities were key , and said all the government had provided was " years of broken promises " .
liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb said : " delivery on these promises will be key .
will the money actually be used for anti-infection measures , such as recruitment of new staff ? "

the infection strategy for england includes more infection control nurses , patient screening , deep cleaning and campaign to cut antibiotic use .
however much has been announced already , and experts said there was a long fight ahead to beat the bugs .
mrsa and clostridium difficile rates are now both falling , but still cause thousands of deaths a year .
the strategy pulls together a raft of initiatives which the government has been introducing in recent months , as well as some new schemes .
what are the hospital bugs ?
when the subject of hospital infections crops up it is usually in reference to two - c. difficile and the so-called superbug , mrsa mrsa is a potentially lethal bacterium that causes infections in humans .
it is difficult to combat because it has developed a resistance to certain antibiotics c. difficile is nearly 10 times more common than mrsa , although it is less deadly it is a bacterium found in the gut of some adults and most children c. difficile rarely causes problems , but certain antibiotics can disturb the normal balance , allowing the bug to thrive and causing severe diarrhoea and bowel inflammation quick guide : hospital bugs hospital bugs : hot politics ministers said by 2011 there would be an extra £ 270m a year available for infection control - although that is from an nhs budget which is growing by more than £ 5bn a year in the next three years .
nhs trusts will be able to use this money to appoint specialist nurses to combat infections and phase in mrsa screening from 2009 .
local health bosses and regulators will also be able to fine hospitals that are not doing enough to meet c. difficile targets .
and this is to be coupled with a nationwide campaign starting in february about the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections from the overuse of antibiotics .
ministers also said that a month after the start of the campaign , hospitals should have finished the deep clean programme which was announced last year .
health secretary alan johnson praised the nhs for achieving what was considered impossible in the 1990s - overseeing a fall in mrsa rates .
latest figures from the health protection agency show that mrsa cases fell by 10 % in the most recent three-month period - continuing a downward trend which started in september 2006 .
the figures also showed c. difficile had fallen for the first time , with new cases down 7 % .
mr johnson said there was " still more work to be done " but the government was confident it could continue to curb the threat from both mrsa and c. difficile .
he added : " patients have my assurance that the government will not take its foot off the pedal . "
he also insisted the government was on track to hit its target to halve mrsa rates by the end of march 2008 .
it has been widely assumed this goal will be missed .
isolation leading microbiologist professor hugh pennington , from aberdeen university , said : " the measures being taken will all help , but one of the key things , especially for the screening , is that we have isolation wards available for infected patients .
" i do n't think there is enough capacity for this at the moment and even though the rates look like they are coming down , there is still a long way to go .
" i think it will take another five years before we get our rates down to the best of the other european countries . "
stephen rowling , a senior nurse at university college hospital in london , is involved in a nationwide initiative to improve infection control in hospitals .
he told bbc five live that medical staff were only getting disinfection procedures right half the time .
" we 've rolled this out in a number of hospitals now and the first stage of doing that is auditing wards and hospitals to see how good their practice is - and very typically practice is usually around 50 % good and 50 % not so good and our job is to improve the 50 % , " he said .
jo webber , from the nhs confederation , which represents all trusts and hospitals , stressed different measures were required for different bugs .
for instance , alcohol rubs were effective against mrsa , but soap and water was the best way to reduce the threat of c. difficile .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley agreed isolation facilities were key , and said all the government had provided was " years of broken promises " .
liberal democrat health spokesman norman lamb said : " delivery on these promises will be key .
will the money actually be used for anti-infection measures , such as recruitment of new staff ? "

" we want to be mobile and not tethered to our desks anymore - we can take our computing power with us , " said mooly eden , general manager of the mobile platform group at intel .
" today 's laptops have more processing power than all the computers that took the apollo rocket to the moon , " he added .
laptop sales are expected to overtake desktop sales around the world by 2009 as the shift to an untethered computer experience accelerates .
" consumers want the performance of a desktop - they are not willing to compromise , " said mr eden .
" they want battery life , they want wi-fi connectivity and good form factor . "
intel is pushing hard into the mobile space .
at ces this week the company announced five processors for laptops , using its latest chip designs made up of transistors with features just 45 billionths of a metre in size .
it also announced a new dedicated chip set , called menlow , which will power a new generation of ultra mobile computers .
" much of our future , in terms of volume , is going to be in this area , " paul otellini , chief executive of intel told bbc news .
sales of so-called ultra mobile pcs -lrb- umpc -rrb- , which were first launched in 2006 , have been modest , but mr otellini said the market was still evolving .
" ultra mobility is the ability to access all of your information , get in touch with anyone you want to , collaborate with anyone , and run any application you want from anywhere on the planet , " said dennis moore , chief executive of oqo , which builds umpcs .
he added : " it 's about getting the same kind of connectivity and performance as sitting at your desktop pc . "
companies such as samsung , iriver , lenovo , lg and toshiba have committed to building these mobile devices .
at ces mr otellini showed off a toshiba portable computer about the size of a paperback book running windows vista .
" the menlow-powered device from toshiba has the same performance as the most powerful centrino laptop two years ago , " he told bbc news .
intel gave the centrino label to a combination of chipset and wi-fi technologies optimised for mobile computers .
key issue " we will have dual and quad-core processors in these devices in just a couple of years , " he added .
the relationship between computing power and battery life was the key issue in making portable computers practical , said mr eden .
" more performance means more transistors and more transistors means more power and more power is less battery life ; that is a problem for laptops , " said mr eden .
power efficiency the crucial development for ultra mobile devices is the power efficiency afforded by the latest chip designs .
intel 's menlow chip set is five times smaller and consumes 10 times less power than ultra low voltage mobile processors introduced in 2006 . "
soon you will be able to have connected experience everywhere you go " dennis moore , oqo mr moore said : " power is not an issue on a desktop , because a giant fan can suck the heat out of the machine ; it is in a umpc .
" you can measure the progress because a typical umpc is smaller than the fan in a typical desktop computer . "
he added : " today 's chips do not overheat , do not drain the battery in an hour . "
lightweight machine the goal , said mr eden , was to build laptops - and umpcs - which could run off a battery for an entire day .
companies such as qualcomm are also building processors to drive a new generation of lightweight computers .
it unveiled two designs , called anchorage and fairbanks , at ces .
other firms committed to a new generation of mobile computers include taiwanese firm asus , which has enjoyed success with its eee pc - a lightweight machine , which can run windows xp , and uses solid state drives instead of hard drives to keep the weight down and improve reliability .
mr eden said : " moving to solid state drives is inevitable .
this is a revolution that must happen .
they have many advantages compared to rotational drives - they consume less power , they are more reliable because you do n't have moving parts .
" this is the optimal solution for notebooks .
the only problem today is the pricing .
and for that reason economies of scale will play its game . "
solid state drives are more expensive to manufacture than hard drives as they are built from silicon - and lack the higher storage functionality of a hard drive .
however , bit micro are expected to announce a 2.5in 832 gigabyte solid state drive at ces , closing the gap on hard disks .
for maximum mobility , toshiba and samsung both unveiled 1.8in solid state drives that can hold 128 gb of data .
wireless broadband drives like this will start to make their way into devices in the coming months , along with other technologies such as wimax .
the next generation wireless broadband will be introduced into a device from oqo later this year .
its current flagship umpc , the e2 , can run windows vista operating system and can also connect to the net over wi-fi and 3.5g mobile networks .
at ces on monday asus also announced it would release a wimax-enabled version of its eee pc .
mr otellini said intel too was looking to roll out wimax in its chips designed for laptops in 2008 .
" soon you will be able to have a connected experience everywhere you go , " said mr moore .
" you wo n't need to worry about finding a wireless hotspot and with improvements in battery life and power efficiency you wo n't need to worry about recharging , " he added .

" we want to be mobile and not tethered to our desks anymore - we can take our computing power with us , " said mooly eden , general manager of the mobile platform group at intel .
" today 's laptops have more processing power than all the computers that took the apollo rocket to the moon , " he added .
laptop sales are expected to overtake desktop sales around the world by 2009 as the shift to an untethered computer experience accelerates .
" consumers want the performance of a desktop - they are not willing to compromise , " said mr eden .
" they want battery life , they want wi-fi connectivity and good form factor . "
intel is pushing hard into the mobile space .
at ces this week the company announced five processors for laptops , using its latest chip designs made up of transistors with features just 45 billionths of a metre in size .
today 's ultra mobile pcs have the same power as 2005 's laptops it also announced a new dedicated chip set , called menlow , which will power a new generation of ultra mobile computers .
" much of our future , in terms of volume , is going to be in this area , " paul otellini , chief executive of intel told bbc news .
sales of so-called ultra mobile pcs -lrb- umpc -rrb- , which were first launched in 2006 , have been modest , but mr otellini said the market was still evolving .
" ultra mobility is the ability to access all of your information , get in touch with anyone you want to , collaborate with anyone , and run any application you want from anywhere on the planet , " said dennis moore , chief executive of oqo , which builds umpcs .
he added : " it 's about getting the same kind of connectivity and performance as sitting at your desktop pc . "
companies such as samsung , iriver , lenovo , lg and toshiba have committed to building these mobile devices .
at ces mr otellini showed off a toshiba portable computer about the size of a paperback book running windows vista .
" the menlow-powered device from toshiba has the same performance as the most powerful centrino laptop two years ago , " he told bbc news .
intel gave the centrino label to a combination of chipset and wi-fi technologies optimised for mobile computers .
key issue " we will have dual and quad-core processors in these devices in just a couple of years , " he added .
the relationship between computing power and battery life was the key issue in making portable computers practical , said mr eden .
" more performance means more transistors and more transistors means more power and more power is less battery life ; that is a problem for laptops , " said mr eden .
power efficiency the crucial development for ultra mobile devices is the power efficiency afforded by the latest chip designs .
intel 's menlow chip set is five times smaller and consumes 10 times less power than ultra low voltage mobile processors introduced in 2006 .
soon you will be able to have connected experience everywhere you go dennis moore , oqo mr moore said : " power is not an issue on a desktop , because a giant fan can suck the heat out of the machine ; it is in a umpc .
" you can measure the progress because a typical umpc is smaller than the fan in a typical desktop computer . "
he added : " today 's chips do not overheat , do not drain the battery in an hour . "
lightweight machine the goal , said mr eden , was to build laptops - and umpcs - which could run off a battery for an entire day .
companies such as qualcomm are also building processors to drive a new generation of lightweight computers .
it unveiled two designs , called anchorage and fairbanks , at ces .
other firms committed to a new generation of mobile computers include taiwanese firm asus , which has enjoyed success with its eee pc - a lightweight machine , which can run windows xp , and uses solid state drives instead of hard drives to keep the weight down and improve reliability .
mr eden said : " moving to solid state drives is inevitable .
this is a revolution that must happen .
they have many advantages compared to rotational drives - they consume less power , they are more reliable because you do n't have moving parts .
" this is the optimal solution for notebooks .
the only problem today is the pricing .

" we want to be mobile and not tethered to our desks anymore - we can take our computing power with us , " said mooly eden , general manager of the mobile platform group at intel .
" today 's laptops have more processing power than all the computers that took the apollo rocket to the moon , " he added .
laptop sales are expected to overtake desktop sales around the world by 2009 as the shift to an untethered computer experience accelerates .
" consumers want the performance of a desktop - they are not willing to compromise , " said mr eden .
" they want battery life , they want wi-fi connectivity and good form factor . "
intel is pushing hard into the mobile space .
at ces this week the company announced five processors for laptops , using its latest chip designs made up of transistors with features just 45 billionths of a metre in size .
today 's ultra mobile pcs have the same power as 2005 's laptops it also announced a new dedicated chip set , called menlow , which will power a new generation of ultra mobile computers .
" much of our future , in terms of volume , is going to be in this area , " paul otellini , chief executive of intel told bbc news .
sales of so-called ultra mobile pcs -lrb- umpc -rrb- , which were first launched in 2006 , have been modest , but mr otellini said the market was still evolving .
" ultra mobility is the ability to access all of your information , get in touch with anyone you want to , collaborate with anyone , and run any application you want from anywhere on the planet , " said dennis moore , chief executive of oqo , which builds umpcs .
he added : " it 's about getting the same kind of connectivity and performance as sitting at your desktop pc . "
companies such as samsung , iriver , lenovo , lg and toshiba have committed to building these mobile devices .
at ces mr otellini showed off a toshiba portable computer about the size of a paperback book running windows vista .
" the menlow-powered device from toshiba has the same performance as the most powerful centrino laptop two years ago , " he told bbc news .
intel gave the centrino label to a combination of chipset and wi-fi technologies optimised for mobile computers .
key issue " we will have dual and quad-core processors in these devices in just a couple of years , " he added .
the relationship between computing power and battery life was the key issue in making portable computers practical , said mr eden .
" more performance means more transistors and more transistors means more power and more power is less battery life ; that is a problem for laptops , " said mr eden .
power efficiency the crucial development for ultra mobile devices is the power efficiency afforded by the latest chip designs .
intel 's menlow chip set is five times smaller and consumes 10 times less power than ultra low voltage mobile processors introduced in 2006 .
soon you will be able to have connected experience everywhere you go dennis moore , oqo mr moore said : " power is not an issue on a desktop , because a giant fan can suck the heat out of the machine ; it is in a umpc .
" you can measure the progress because a typical umpc is smaller than the fan in a typical desktop computer . "
he added : " today 's chips do not overheat , do not drain the battery in an hour . "
lightweight machine the goal , said mr eden , was to build laptops - and umpcs - which could run off a battery for an entire day .
companies such as qualcomm are also building processors to drive a new generation of lightweight computers .
it unveiled two designs , called anchorage and fairbanks , at ces .
other firms committed to a new generation of mobile computers include taiwanese firm asus , which has enjoyed success with its eee pc - a lightweight machine , which can run windows xp , and uses solid state drives instead of hard drives to keep the weight down and improve reliability .
mr eden said : " moving to solid state drives is inevitable .
this is a revolution that must happen .
they have many advantages compared to rotational drives - they consume less power , they are more reliable because you do n't have moving parts .
" this is the optimal solution for notebooks .
the only problem today is the pricing .
and for that reason economies of scale will play its game . "
solid state drives are more expensive to manufacture than hard drives as they are built from silicon - and lack the higher storage functionality of a hard drive .
however , bit micro are expected to announce a 2.5in 832 gigabyte solid state drive at ces , closing the gap on hard disks .
for maximum mobility , toshiba and samsung both unveiled 1.8in solid state drives that can hold 128 gb of data .
wireless broadband drives like this will start to make their way into devices in the coming months , along with other technologies such as wimax .
the next generation wireless broadband will be introduced into a device from oqo later this year .
its current flagship umpc , the e2 , can run windows vista operating system and can also connect to the net over wi-fi and 3.5g mobile networks .
at ces on monday asus also announced it would release a wimax-enabled version of its eee pc .
mr otellini said intel too was looking to roll out wimax in its chips designed for laptops in 2008 .
" soon you will be able to have a connected experience everywhere you go , " said mr moore .
" you wo n't need to worry about finding a wireless hotspot and with improvements in battery life and power efficiency you wo n't need to worry about recharging , " he added .

production of ultra-thin plastic bags will also be banned , the state council said in a statement .
instead , people will be encouraged to use baskets or reusable cloth bags for their shopping , the council said .
the move comes amid growing concern about pollution and environmental degradation in china .
china was using huge quantities of plastic bags each year , the state council , china 's cabinet , said in its directive , posted on the main government website .
" plastic shopping bags , due to reasons such as excessive use and inefficient recycling , have caused serious energy and resources waste and environment pollution , " it said .
easily discarded of particular concern were cheap , flimsy bags that many shopkeepers routinely handed out to customers .
" the super-thin bags have especially become a main source of plastic pollution as they are easy to break and thus disposed of carelessly , " the statement said .
shops that violated the new rules could be fined or have their goods confiscated , it said .
the council also called for greater recycling efforts from rubbish collectors , and suggested financial authorities should consider higher taxes on the production and sale of plastic bags .
in recent years , china 's rapid development has triggered concerns over pollution and use of resources .
but correspondents say that there is a growing awareness that more needs to be done to protect the environment .
