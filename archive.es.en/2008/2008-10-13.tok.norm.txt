dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .

minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .
the eu most recently showed dissatisfaction with elections last month won hands down by lukashenko allies .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "

he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .

" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks will have to pay 2 percent interest on loan guarantees setting up the fund will increase germany 's net public borrowing , but the bill states that , initially , none of the money will be budgeted as federal expenditure .
the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck 's plans to balance germany 's budget are now on hold one christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier , peter mueller of saarland state , welcomed the package , but said he favoured a cap on state aid to the banks .
" banks that have misbehaved on the markets should be held responsible for it , " he said .
others criticized finance minister steinbrueck for apparently abandoning plans to balance the german federal budget by 2011 .
guenther oettinger , the cdu premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , said , " a brake on public debt is just as necessary , even more necessary in the future . "
the mass-circulation newspaper bild had quoted steinbrueck as saying , " we 'll keep our target of balancing the budget in mind , but it 's going to take longer now . "
opposition parties were expected to demand the imposition of tougher conditions on the banks to be rescued .
on n-tv television , greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer , said , " the government ca n't expect to be given a blank cheque . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .
however , the current turmoil means we have to look at every option . "
a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .
" negotiation with iceland , theoretically speaking , could go fast because as a member of the european economic area , it has already adopted many eu laws , " a commission official said .
a nation facing bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland fears losing control over its fish stocks iceland was forced over the past week to take over three big banks , shut down its stock market and abandon attempts to defend its free-falling currency .
trading in icelandic shares had been due to start again on monday , sept .
13 , but the exchange said it would now start on tuesday .
foreign minister ingibjorg solrun gisladottir , writing in monday 's edition of the morgunbladid newspaper , said eu accession and the adoption of the euro now had to be a long-term ambition .
gisladottir , a member of the pro-eu social democrat party , also stressed the importance of working with the imf .
" in the short term , our defence is cooperation with the international monetary fund and in the long term eu membership , adoption of the euro and backup from the european central bank , " she wrote .
an approach to the imf is likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been a nightmarish week for iceland 's prime minister on sunday , a top minister gave the strongest signal yet that iceland might seek help from the international monetary fund after the country downplayed the idea last week .
the issue is whether to ask the imf for foreign currency to ensure the flow of imports and to help banks trade again .
" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .
skarphedinsson said that would give iceland the opportunity to rapidly rebuild its foreign exchange market , strengthen its currency and cut interest rates .
on friday , prime minister geir haarde said iceland would not take the decision while the finance minister was in washington for annual imf meetings .
the gathering ends on monday .
meanwhile also on monday , a delegation of icelandic central bank and finance ministry officials are leaving for moscow with the hope of securing a loan of some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- .
this has caused disquiet in europe with speculation about moscow 's motives and what price it may extract from iceland , a nato member . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .
" we will provide technical assistance as needed and , in the context of a supportive policy setting , are ready to undertake discussions on possible finance assistance , responding rapidly , " said imf chief dominique strauss-kahn .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the imf offer was important for showing that his country had access to such resources .
" we needed this offer so those who attack us see that we have strong allies and that hungary in not alone , " gyurcsany said .
" we needed this offer so we 'd never have to resort to using it . "
polish , czechs slow euro plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf head dominique strauss-kahn in poland , meanwhile , the government announced it would re-evaluate plans to introduce the euro by 2012 .
" the current situation prompts a rethink of the euro entry date , " polish central bank chief slawomir skrzypek said monday .
" before we enter the erm-2 rate exchange mechanism , the global financial turmoil should be finished , " he said .
poland 's currency slid against the euro friday morning to 3.638 zlotys compared to 3.452 thursday afternoon and later rose to 3.548 in trading ..
" the weakening of the zloty is linked to the general situation , the withdrawal of capital from emerging markets , but it is also due to rumours surrounding hungary 's otp bank that have weakened the hungarian currency , " mateusz mokrogulski , chief analyst with poland 's bgz bank , told news agency afp friday .
in the czech republic , finance minister miroslav kalousek said his country would now be looking at a longer-term approach to joining the eurozone .
" at the moment , when a number of significant countries in the eurozone say that the growth and stability pact does not have to be essential and important for them , then i am -lrb- cautiously -rrb- considering our entry date to the euro zone , " kalousek said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget . " all the numbers are just made up , " they said as government officials worked all weekend on the emergency plan that was discussed at a meeting of euro zone leaders in paris on sunday . merkel 's greatest challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much work to be done at european financial centers , like frankfurt merkel promised clarity about the rescue package 's proposals on monday after she met with cabinet ministers in berlin .
politicians - and investors - are hoping for a comprehensive answer to the global financial crisis . " germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .

billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .
spotlight falls on german tv standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's participation in the literary quartet made him famous the incident looks set to spark a debate about standards in german tv , which has seen a shift away from high-brow , and at times rather staid , programming to tabloid formats over the last decade .
the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .

just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "

he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .

a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .

" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .

a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .
it may sound strange , but to play against the bigger , better teams is easier , " said the west ham frontman . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .
" we will provide technical assistance as needed and , in the context of a supportive policy setting , are ready to undertake discussions on possible finance assistance , responding rapidly , " said imf chief dominique strauss-kahn .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the imf offer was important for showing that his country had access to such resources .
" we needed this offer so those who attack us see that we have strong allies and that hungary in not alone , " gyurcsany said .
" we needed this offer so we 'd never have to resort to using it . "
polish , czechs slow euro plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf head dominique strauss-kahn in poland , meanwhile , the government announced it would re-evaluate plans to introduce the euro by 2012 .

afraid of lending to failing institutions , banks were " keeping liquidity for themselves and it was no longer circulating , " sarkozy told journalists in paris .
“ we have to create conditions to get it moving again . ”
to that end , the french government will create an authority that will guarantee loans for a period of five years , the french president said .
in return , banks will be asked to abide by certain obligations , including the manner in which their executives are paid .
sarkozy has vowed to do away with exorbitant severance payments to executives who have incurred unreasonable risks .
pan-european action the french package forms part of a sweeping , europe-wide , trillion-dollar bailout of banks .
the german government announced its own rescue package monday , which is to include 80 billion euros in fresh capital and 400 billion euros in loan guarantees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a trillion dollars has gone into europe-wide bailout plans announced monday the british government , meanwhile , said it would invest 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros -rrb- in its ailing banks .
when announcing the german bailout package , chancellor angela merkel insisted that international efforts to halt the downward spiral of global finance markets would amount to nought if not accompanied by parallel regulation that would end “ market excesses . ”
“ today 's measures are the first element of a new financial market charter ... but it can only be worthy of the name if it is followed by a second element , namely a change in international rules , " she said after her cabinet approved the package .
likewise , in madrid , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced that the spanish government would set aside a maximum of 100 billion euros to cover interbank loans .
the governments of austria , italy and the netherlands also said they would shore up their banks instant reaction as news of the european bailouts aired , shares rose strongly across the board .
the london ftse 100 index of leading shares gained 8.26 percent , in paris the cac 40 rose 11.18 percent - its largest ever one-day gain - while the frankfurt dax soared 11.40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares worldwide rallied amid news of the european rescue plans the swiss market index gained 11.39 percent , while increases of 11.49 percent in milan and 10.65 percent in madrid were recorded .
in rhetoric aimed at soothing ongoing market fears , sarkozy said the french state would take control of any bank and change its management to prevent it from going bust .
“ the french state will not let any bank fail , " the french president declared .
" the greatest risk now would have been not to be bold , " he said .
" there was no other reasonable choice . "
recession “ unavoidable ” despite the renewed market confidence , dominique barbet , an economist for the french bank bnp paribas , said the proposals to support interbank lending and struggling financial institutions " look okay " but have probably come too late to avoid a recession .
" the problem is that no matter what measures you take you will not avoid a credit crunch , " barbet said .
" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .

afraid of lending to failing institutions , banks were " keeping liquidity for themselves and it was no longer circulating , " sarkozy told journalists in paris .
“ we have to create conditions to get it moving again . ”
to that end , the french government will create an authority that will guarantee loans for a period of five years , the french president said .
in return , banks will be asked to abide by certain obligations , including the manner in which their executives are paid .
sarkozy has vowed to do away with exorbitant severance payments to executives who have incurred unreasonable risks .
pan-european action the french package forms part of a sweeping , europe-wide , trillion-dollar bailout of banks .
the german government announced its own rescue package monday , which is to include 80 billion euros in fresh capital and 400 billion euros in loan guarantees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a trillion dollars has gone into europe-wide bailout plans announced monday the british government , meanwhile , said it would invest 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros -rrb- in its ailing banks .
when announcing the german bailout package , chancellor angela merkel insisted that international efforts to halt the downward spiral of global finance markets would amount to nought if not accompanied by parallel regulation that would end “ market excesses . ”
“ today 's measures are the first element of a new financial market charter ... but it can only be worthy of the name if it is followed by a second element , namely a change in international rules , " she said after her cabinet approved the package .
likewise , in madrid , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced that the spanish government would set aside a maximum of 100 billion euros to cover interbank loans .
the governments of austria , italy and the netherlands also said they would shore up their banks instant reaction as news of the european bailouts aired , shares rose strongly across the board .
the london ftse 100 index of leading shares gained 8.26 percent , in paris the cac 40 rose 11.18 percent - its largest ever one-day gain - while the frankfurt dax soared 11.40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares worldwide rallied amid news of the european rescue plans the swiss market index gained 11.39 percent , while increases of 11.49 percent in milan and 10.65 percent in madrid were recorded .
in rhetoric aimed at soothing ongoing market fears , sarkozy said the french state would take control of any bank and change its management to prevent it from going bust .
“ the french state will not let any bank fail , " the french president declared .
" the greatest risk now would have been not to be bold , " he said .
" there was no other reasonable choice . "
recession “ unavoidable ” despite the renewed market confidence , dominique barbet , an economist for the french bank bnp paribas , said the proposals to support interbank lending and struggling financial institutions " look okay " but have probably come too late to avoid a recession .
" the problem is that no matter what measures you take you will not avoid a credit crunch , " barbet said .
" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .
" we will provide technical assistance as needed and , in the context of a supportive policy setting , are ready to undertake discussions on possible finance assistance , responding rapidly , " said imf chief dominique strauss-kahn .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the imf offer was important for showing that his country had access to such resources .
" we needed this offer so those who attack us see that we have strong allies and that hungary in not alone , " gyurcsany said .
" we needed this offer so we 'd never have to resort to using it . "
polish , czechs slow euro plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf head dominique strauss-kahn in poland , meanwhile , the government announced it would re-evaluate plans to introduce the euro by 2012 .

" before we enter the erm-2 rate exchange mechanism , the global financial turmoil should be finished , " he said .
poland 's currency slid against the euro friday morning to 3.638 zlotys compared to 3.452 thursday afternoon and later rose to 3.548 in trading ..
" the weakening of the zloty is linked to the general situation , the withdrawal of capital from emerging markets , but it is also due to rumours surrounding hungary 's otp bank that have weakened the hungarian currency , " mateusz mokrogulski , chief analyst with poland 's bgz bank , told news agency afp friday .
in the czech republic , finance minister miroslav kalousek said his country would now be looking at a longer-term approach to joining the eurozone .
" at the moment , when a number of significant countries in the eurozone say that the growth and stability pact does not have to be essential and important for them , then i am -lrb- cautiously -rrb- considering our entry date to the euro zone , " kalousek said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain was the first to green-light a plan worth 37 billion pounds . britain announced its plan monday , oct .
13 , after a red-eye session between british banks and treasury officials ended with britain 's government saying it planned to invest up to 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros , $ 64 billion dollars -rrb- in ailing british banks royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- , halifax bank of scotland -lrb- hbos -rrb- and lloyds tsb .
also on monday , rbs announced plans to raise 20 billion pounds of new capital under a government bailout plan .
as part of the plan , the bank also said its chief executive , fred goodwin , would step down .
the move follows recent turmoil surrounding the bank which saw its share price fall to 1.71 pence .
merger partners hbos and lloyds , are set to raise a combined 17 billion pounds , with hbos taking on 11.3 billion pounds of that , including 3 billion through the sale of preference shares , to strengthen its balance sheet .
hbos chief executive andy hornby and chairman dennis stevenson were likewise to step down . the move effectively means that the government will hold a 57 percent stake in rbs and 43.5 percent in the combined hbos / lloyds tsb group . barclays said it would not draw on the government funds and would instead raise 6.5 billion pounds from shareholders .
they remain eligible for government assistance , however , should that fall through .
central banks to offer short-term loans bildunterschrift : the move boosted the london stock market monday morning meanwhile , central banks across the continent said they would provide unlimited amounts of dollar loans .
the bank of england , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and swiss national bank will make us dollar loans for periods of seven , 28 and 84 days " at fixed interest rates for full allotment , " a statement by the ecb said .
the decision was part of a fresh push by central banks around the globe to boost the supply of dollars in stressed credit markets .
those markets came to a standstill after the international financial crisis made banks wary of lending to each other because they were unsure that borrowers would be able to pay back the loans .
by providing unlimited amounts of dollars to commercial banks , referred to as counterparties , the banks aimed " to improve liquidity in short-term us dollar funding markets , " the statement said .
" counterparties in these operations will be able to borrow any amount they wish against the appropriate collateral in each jurisdiction , " the central banks said .
they added that they " will continue to work together and are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to provide sufficient liquidity in short-term funding markets . "

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .
it may sound strange , but to play against the bigger , better teams is easier , " said the west ham frontman . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .
it may sound strange , but to play against the bigger , better teams is easier , " said the west ham frontman . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .

in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .
it may sound strange , but to play against the bigger , better teams is easier , " said the west ham frontman . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .
spotlight falls on german tv standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's participation in the literary quartet made him famous the incident looks set to spark a debate about standards in german tv , which has seen a shift away from high-brow , and at times rather staid , programming to tabloid formats over the last decade .
the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .

the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .

the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .

" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .

" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .

afraid of lending to failing institutions , banks were " keeping liquidity for themselves and it was no longer circulating , " sarkozy told journalists in paris .
“ we have to create conditions to get it moving again . ”
to that end , the french government will create an authority that will guarantee loans for a period of five years , the french president said .
in return , banks will be asked to abide by certain obligations , including the manner in which their executives are paid .
sarkozy has vowed to do away with exorbitant severance payments to executives who have incurred unreasonable risks .
pan-european action the french package forms part of a sweeping , europe-wide , trillion-dollar bailout of banks .
the german government announced its own rescue package monday , which is to include 80 billion euros in fresh capital and 400 billion euros in loan guarantees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a trillion dollars has gone into europe-wide bailout plans announced monday the british government , meanwhile , said it would invest 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros -rrb- in its ailing banks .
when announcing the german bailout package , chancellor angela merkel insisted that international efforts to halt the downward spiral of global finance markets would amount to nought if not accompanied by parallel regulation that would end “ market excesses . ”
“ today 's measures are the first element of a new financial market charter ... but it can only be worthy of the name if it is followed by a second element , namely a change in international rules , " she said after her cabinet approved the package .
likewise , in madrid , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced that the spanish government would set aside a maximum of 100 billion euros to cover interbank loans .
the governments of austria , italy and the netherlands also said they would shore up their banks instant reaction as news of the european bailouts aired , shares rose strongly across the board .
the london ftse 100 index of leading shares gained 8.26 percent , in paris the cac 40 rose 11.18 percent - its largest ever one-day gain - while the frankfurt dax soared 11.40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares worldwide rallied amid news of the european rescue plans the swiss market index gained 11.39 percent , while increases of 11.49 percent in milan and 10.65 percent in madrid were recorded .
in rhetoric aimed at soothing ongoing market fears , sarkozy said the french state would take control of any bank and change its management to prevent it from going bust .
“ the french state will not let any bank fail , " the french president declared .
" the greatest risk now would have been not to be bold , " he said .
" there was no other reasonable choice . "
recession “ unavoidable ” despite the renewed market confidence , dominique barbet , an economist for the french bank bnp paribas , said the proposals to support interbank lending and struggling financial institutions " look okay " but have probably come too late to avoid a recession .
" the problem is that no matter what measures you take you will not avoid a credit crunch , " barbet said .
" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .
it may sound strange , but to play against the bigger , better teams is easier , " said the west ham frontman . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks will have to pay 2 percent interest on loan guarantees setting up the fund will increase germany 's net public borrowing , but the bill states that , initially , none of the money will be budgeted as federal expenditure .
the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck 's plans to balance germany 's budget are now on hold one christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier , peter mueller of saarland state , welcomed the package , but said he favoured a cap on state aid to the banks .
" banks that have misbehaved on the markets should be held responsible for it , " he said .
others criticized finance minister steinbrueck for apparently abandoning plans to balance the german federal budget by 2011 .
guenther oettinger , the cdu premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , said , " a brake on public debt is just as necessary , even more necessary in the future . "
the mass-circulation newspaper bild had quoted steinbrueck as saying , " we 'll keep our target of balancing the budget in mind , but it 's going to take longer now . "
opposition parties were expected to demand the imposition of tougher conditions on the banks to be rescued .
on n-tv television , greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer , said , " the government ca n't expect to be given a blank cheque . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .

prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks will have to pay 2 percent interest on loan guarantees setting up the fund will increase germany 's net public borrowing , but the bill states that , initially , none of the money will be budgeted as federal expenditure .
the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck 's plans to balance germany 's budget are now on hold one christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier , peter mueller of saarland state , welcomed the package , but said he favoured a cap on state aid to the banks .
" banks that have misbehaved on the markets should be held responsible for it , " he said .
others criticized finance minister steinbrueck for apparently abandoning plans to balance the german federal budget by 2011 .
guenther oettinger , the cdu premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , said , " a brake on public debt is just as necessary , even more necessary in the future . "
the mass-circulation newspaper bild had quoted steinbrueck as saying , " we 'll keep our target of balancing the budget in mind , but it 's going to take longer now . "
opposition parties were expected to demand the imposition of tougher conditions on the banks to be rescued .
on n-tv television , greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer , said , " the government ca n't expect to be given a blank cheque . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .

" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .
spotlight falls on german tv standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's participation in the literary quartet made him famous the incident looks set to spark a debate about standards in german tv , which has seen a shift away from high-brow , and at times rather staid , programming to tabloid formats over the last decade .
the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .

" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .

a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .

" it is very important that a european signal goes out that we will play no part in supporting a power grab by the mugabe regime , " miliband said upon his arrival in luxembourg for a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
during a meeting in the grand duchy , the 27 ministers issued a joint statement expressing " concern " at the lack of progress on the power sharing deal , signed by mugabe and tsvangirai on september 15 .
the deal came just as eu governments had been set to toughen their sactions , including the severing of ties with businesses linked to the 84-year-old president , which they postponed in light of the power sharing agreement .
by making a " unilateral decision " to form a new government , mugabe is threatening to scuttle the agreement by retaining control of key ministries responsible for the army , police and secret police .
the president was accused of using such forces to intimidate opposition supporters in the run up to the march presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's foreign minister david miliband his opponent , morgan tsvangirai , said sunday that the power-sharing agreement would be " stillborn " as mugabe has moved to retain control of the key ministry of home affairs .
united response to power deadlock in their joint statement , the ministers announced that " the council stands ready to consider additional measures in case of continued deadlock in the implementation of the september 15 agreement . "
they also reiterated their concern at the " deteriorating humanitarian situation in zimbabwe " and noted that the european commission was providing an additional 10 million euros -lrb- 13.6 million dollars -rrb- in aid to the country .
" it is important , " miliband said , " -lrb- that -rrb- there is an international united response that says that the results of the elections need to be respected , and a power grab will not be respected . "

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .

the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .

" it is very important that a european signal goes out that we will play no part in supporting a power grab by the mugabe regime , " miliband said upon his arrival in luxembourg for a meeting of eu foreign ministers .
during a meeting in the grand duchy , the 27 ministers issued a joint statement expressing " concern " at the lack of progress on the power sharing deal , signed by mugabe and tsvangirai on september 15 .
the deal came just as eu governments had been set to toughen their sactions , including the severing of ties with businesses linked to the 84-year-old president , which they postponed in light of the power sharing agreement .
by making a " unilateral decision " to form a new government , mugabe is threatening to scuttle the agreement by retaining control of key ministries responsible for the army , police and secret police .
the president was accused of using such forces to intimidate opposition supporters in the run up to the march presidential election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's foreign minister david miliband his opponent , morgan tsvangirai , said sunday that the power-sharing agreement would be " stillborn " as mugabe has moved to retain control of the key ministry of home affairs .

they also reiterated their concern at the " deteriorating humanitarian situation in zimbabwe " and noted that the european commission was providing an additional 10 million euros -lrb- 13.6 million dollars -rrb- in aid to the country .
" it is important , " miliband said , " -lrb- that -rrb- there is an international united response that says that the results of the elections need to be respected , and a power grab will not be respected . "
the statement came as mugabe swore in his two vice presidents monday . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .

what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .

the government said it would announce details of the bailout on monday . the highest estimate of 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 550 billion -rrb- was made by otto fricke of the opposition free-market liberal fdp who chairs the bundestag budget committee , in an interview with a cologne newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger on monday , oct .
13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget . " all the numbers are just made up , " they said as government officials worked all weekend on the emergency plan that was discussed at a meeting of euro zone leaders in paris on sunday . merkel 's greatest challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much work to be done at european financial centers , like frankfurt merkel promised clarity about the rescue package 's proposals on monday after she met with cabinet ministers in berlin .
politicians - and investors - are hoping for a comprehensive answer to the global financial crisis . " germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .
not even coordinated global interest rate cuts buoyed markets for long .
billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government said it would announce details of the bailout on monday . the highest estimate of 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 550 billion -rrb- was made by otto fricke of the opposition free-market liberal fdp who chairs the bundestag budget committee , in an interview with a cologne newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger on monday , oct .
13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget . " all the numbers are just made up , " they said as government officials worked all weekend on the emergency plan that was discussed at a meeting of euro zone leaders in paris on sunday . merkel 's greatest challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much work to be done at european financial centers , like frankfurt merkel promised clarity about the rescue package 's proposals on monday after she met with cabinet ministers in berlin .
politicians - and investors - are hoping for a comprehensive answer to the global financial crisis . " germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .
not even coordinated global interest rate cuts buoyed markets for long .
billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 13.10.2008 britain announces financial bailout plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british bank and treasury officials worked through the night on the 37-billion-pound bailout governments across europe began announcing bailout plans monday after an extraordinary meeting of euro zone leaders in paris over the weekend .
britain was the first to green-light a plan worth 37 billion pounds . britain announced its plan monday , oct .
13 , after a red-eye session between british banks and treasury officials ended with britain 's government saying it planned to invest up to 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros , $ 64 billion dollars -rrb- in ailing british banks royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- , halifax bank of scotland -lrb- hbos -rrb- and lloyds tsb .
also on monday , rbs announced plans to raise 20 billion pounds of new capital under a government bailout plan .
as part of the plan , the bank also said its chief executive , fred goodwin , would step down .
the move follows recent turmoil surrounding the bank which saw its share price fall to 1.71 pence .
merger partners hbos and lloyds , are set to raise a combined 17 billion pounds , with hbos taking on 11.3 billion pounds of that , including 3 billion through the sale of preference shares , to strengthen its balance sheet .
hbos chief executive andy hornby and chairman dennis stevenson were likewise to step down . the move effectively means that the government will hold a 57 percent stake in rbs and 43.5 percent in the combined hbos / lloyds tsb group . barclays said it would not draw on the government funds and would instead raise 6.5 billion pounds from shareholders .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks will have to pay 2 percent interest on loan guarantees setting up the fund will increase germany 's net public borrowing , but the bill states that , initially , none of the money will be budgeted as federal expenditure .
the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck 's plans to balance germany 's budget are now on hold one christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier , peter mueller of saarland state , welcomed the package , but said he favoured a cap on state aid to the banks .
" banks that have misbehaved on the markets should be held responsible for it , " he said .
others criticized finance minister steinbrueck for apparently abandoning plans to balance the german federal budget by 2011 .
guenther oettinger , the cdu premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , said , " a brake on public debt is just as necessary , even more necessary in the future . "
the mass-circulation newspaper bild had quoted steinbrueck as saying , " we 'll keep our target of balancing the budget in mind , but it 's going to take longer now . "
opposition parties were expected to demand the imposition of tougher conditions on the banks to be rescued .
on n-tv television , greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer , said , " the government ca n't expect to be given a blank cheque . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .
spotlight falls on german tv standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's participation in the literary quartet made him famous the incident looks set to spark a debate about standards in german tv , which has seen a shift away from high-brow , and at times rather staid , programming to tabloid formats over the last decade .
the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "

kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .

the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .
the eu most recently showed dissatisfaction with elections last month won hands down by lukashenko allies .
it was believed to have been heavily manipulated . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .

the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget .

" germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .

billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government said it would announce details of the bailout on monday . the highest estimate of 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 550 billion -rrb- was made by otto fricke of the opposition free-market liberal fdp who chairs the bundestag budget committee , in an interview with a cologne newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger on monday , oct .
13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget . " all the numbers are just made up , " they said as government officials worked all weekend on the emergency plan that was discussed at a meeting of euro zone leaders in paris on sunday . merkel 's greatest challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much work to be done at european financial centers , like frankfurt merkel promised clarity about the rescue package 's proposals on monday after she met with cabinet ministers in berlin .
politicians - and investors - are hoping for a comprehensive answer to the global financial crisis . " germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .
not even coordinated global interest rate cuts buoyed markets for long .
billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 13.10.2008 veteran german literary critic refuses " rubbish " tv award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's dramatic performance made for good television a high profile german tv prize ceremony took an unexpected turn when one of germany 's oldest and most respected television personalities refused to accept his award and denounced the whole event as " rubbish . " " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .
spotlight falls on german tv standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's participation in the literary quartet made him famous the incident looks set to spark a debate about standards in german tv , which has seen a shift away from high-brow , and at times rather staid , programming to tabloid formats over the last decade .
the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "

" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "

he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .
however , the current turmoil means we have to look at every option . "
a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .
" negotiation with iceland , theoretically speaking , could go fast because as a member of the european economic area , it has already adopted many eu laws , " a commission official said .
a nation facing bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland fears losing control over its fish stocks iceland was forced over the past week to take over three big banks , shut down its stock market and abandon attempts to defend its free-falling currency .
trading in icelandic shares had been due to start again on monday , sept .
13 , but the exchange said it would now start on tuesday .
foreign minister ingibjorg solrun gisladottir , writing in monday 's edition of the morgunbladid newspaper , said eu accession and the adoption of the euro now had to be a long-term ambition .
gisladottir , a member of the pro-eu social democrat party , also stressed the importance of working with the imf .
" in the short term , our defence is cooperation with the international monetary fund and in the long term eu membership , adoption of the euro and backup from the european central bank , " she wrote .
an approach to the imf is likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been a nightmarish week for iceland 's prime minister on sunday , a top minister gave the strongest signal yet that iceland might seek help from the international monetary fund after the country downplayed the idea last week .
the issue is whether to ask the imf for foreign currency to ensure the flow of imports and to help banks trade again .
" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .
skarphedinsson said that would give iceland the opportunity to rapidly rebuild its foreign exchange market , strengthen its currency and cut interest rates .
on friday , prime minister geir haarde said iceland would not take the decision while the finance minister was in washington for annual imf meetings .

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .

the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .

the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .

in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .

prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .

just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .

the government said it would announce details of the bailout on monday . the highest estimate of 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 550 billion -rrb- was made by otto fricke of the opposition free-market liberal fdp who chairs the bundestag budget committee , in an interview with a cologne newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger on monday , oct .
13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget . " all the numbers are just made up , " they said as government officials worked all weekend on the emergency plan that was discussed at a meeting of euro zone leaders in paris on sunday . merkel 's greatest challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much work to be done at european financial centers , like frankfurt merkel promised clarity about the rescue package 's proposals on monday after she met with cabinet ministers in berlin .
politicians - and investors - are hoping for a comprehensive answer to the global financial crisis . " germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .
not even coordinated global interest rate cuts buoyed markets for long .
billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hbos chief executive andy hornby and chairman dennis stevenson were likewise to step down . the move effectively means that the government will hold a 57 percent stake in rbs and 43.5 percent in the combined hbos / lloyds tsb group . barclays said it would not draw on the government funds and would instead raise 6.5 billion pounds from shareholders .
they remain eligible for government assistance , however , should that fall through .
central banks to offer short-term loans bildunterschrift : the move boosted the london stock market monday morning meanwhile , central banks across the continent said they would provide unlimited amounts of dollar loans .
the bank of england , european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- and swiss national bank will make us dollar loans for periods of seven , 28 and 84 days " at fixed interest rates for full allotment , " a statement by the ecb said .
the decision was part of a fresh push by central banks around the globe to boost the supply of dollars in stressed credit markets .
those markets came to a standstill after the international financial crisis made banks wary of lending to each other because they were unsure that borrowers would be able to pay back the loans .
by providing unlimited amounts of dollars to commercial banks , referred to as counterparties , the banks aimed " to improve liquidity in short-term us dollar funding markets , " the statement said .
" counterparties in these operations will be able to borrow any amount they wish against the appropriate collateral in each jurisdiction , " the central banks said .
they added that they " will continue to work together and are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to provide sufficient liquidity in short-term funding markets . "
last week , the ecb and the us federal reserve unveiled exceptional interest rate cuts , a move that the chinese national bank and the bank of japan later followed . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government said it would announce details of the bailout on monday . the highest estimate of 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 550 billion -rrb- was made by otto fricke of the opposition free-market liberal fdp who chairs the bundestag budget committee , in an interview with a cologne newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger on monday , oct .
13 . members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were tighter in their estimates .
they said that if the government 's cash injections were lost and all the guarantees were called , the bill would total 250 billion euros . that is roughly the same as germany 's entire annual budget this year of 283.2 billion euros . merkel 's staff repeatedly insisted to berlin reporters over the weekend that it was still to early to guess at the cost to the budget . " all the numbers are just made up , " they said as government officials worked all weekend on the emergency plan that was discussed at a meeting of euro zone leaders in paris on sunday . merkel 's greatest challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much work to be done at european financial centers , like frankfurt merkel promised clarity about the rescue package 's proposals on monday after she met with cabinet ministers in berlin .
politicians - and investors - are hoping for a comprehensive answer to the global financial crisis . " germany 's economy has not faced a challenge on this scale since the reunification of east and west germany in 1990 , " said steffen kampeter , the cdu 's budget spokesman . merkel aides spoke of the worst crisis of her chancellorship , which began in 2005 , and the prospect of emergency legislation being rushed through germany 's normally staid parliament undermined that impression . the chancellor also began preparing german public opinion for the bleak news that she is expected to deliver monday . " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now , " she told mass-market weekly bild am sonntag . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interest of the people . " berlin 's decision to issue a bank bailout marked a major change from her stance only last tuesday , when she called the situation serious and unpredictable in a speech to parliament , but gave no hint she had a broad rescue in mind . at that point she spoke of just one rescue , for german mortgage lender hypo real estate , with the implication that one more bailout at the most would see the crisis out . germany 's fading optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck had hoped germany would escape the worst of the credit crunch merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck seemed optimistic at that point that the world 's governments had taken adequate action . but then the stock markets around the world plunged .
not even coordinated global interest rate cuts buoyed markets for long .
billions of dollars in market capitalization vanished , and banks refused to lend one another money .
germany 's main fear at first was that the panic would spread to private depositors and that they would withdraw their money from the banks .
the political assurance a week ago that not one euro in a german savings , current or term account would be lost could prove enormously costly to the government . additionally , the state is about to guarantee interbank lending to get the flow of credit moving again . berlin is also expected to alter accounting rules so that banks can remove tainted assets from the balance sheets , where these toxic loans are eating away at shareholders ' equity . it also seems likely berlin will inject equity into some of the banks as britain did last week .
that will cost money upfront , but the investment could be recovered for the budget later if the banks trade back into the black . ultimately , experts have said , germany may not know the true cost of the rescue program for another five or 10 years . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .

the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .
" we can score goals against decent teams , and there is no more decent side than germany .
it may sound strange , but to play against the bigger , better teams is easier , " said the west ham frontman . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .
" we will provide technical assistance as needed and , in the context of a supportive policy setting , are ready to undertake discussions on possible finance assistance , responding rapidly , " said imf chief dominique strauss-kahn .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the imf offer was important for showing that his country had access to such resources .
" we needed this offer so those who attack us see that we have strong allies and that hungary in not alone , " gyurcsany said .
" we needed this offer so we 'd never have to resort to using it . "
polish , czechs slow euro plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf head dominique strauss-kahn in poland , meanwhile , the government announced it would re-evaluate plans to introduce the euro by 2012 .
" the current situation prompts a rethink of the euro entry date , " polish central bank chief slawomir skrzypek said monday .
" before we enter the erm-2 rate exchange mechanism , the global financial turmoil should be finished , " he said .
poland 's currency slid against the euro friday morning to 3.638 zlotys compared to 3.452 thursday afternoon and later rose to 3.548 in trading ..
" the weakening of the zloty is linked to the general situation , the withdrawal of capital from emerging markets , but it is also due to rumours surrounding hungary 's otp bank that have weakened the hungarian currency , " mateusz mokrogulski , chief analyst with poland 's bgz bank , told news agency afp friday .
in the czech republic , finance minister miroslav kalousek said his country would now be looking at a longer-term approach to joining the eurozone .

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .
the eu most recently showed dissatisfaction with elections last month won hands down by lukashenko allies .
it was believed to have been heavily manipulated . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .
however , the current turmoil means we have to look at every option . "
a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .
" negotiation with iceland , theoretically speaking , could go fast because as a member of the european economic area , it has already adopted many eu laws , " a commission official said .
a nation facing bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland fears losing control over its fish stocks iceland was forced over the past week to take over three big banks , shut down its stock market and abandon attempts to defend its free-falling currency .
trading in icelandic shares had been due to start again on monday , sept .
13 , but the exchange said it would now start on tuesday .
foreign minister ingibjorg solrun gisladottir , writing in monday 's edition of the morgunbladid newspaper , said eu accession and the adoption of the euro now had to be a long-term ambition .
gisladottir , a member of the pro-eu social democrat party , also stressed the importance of working with the imf .
" in the short term , our defence is cooperation with the international monetary fund and in the long term eu membership , adoption of the euro and backup from the european central bank , " she wrote .
an approach to the imf is likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been a nightmarish week for iceland 's prime minister on sunday , a top minister gave the strongest signal yet that iceland might seek help from the international monetary fund after the country downplayed the idea last week .
the issue is whether to ask the imf for foreign currency to ensure the flow of imports and to help banks trade again .
" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .
skarphedinsson said that would give iceland the opportunity to rapidly rebuild its foreign exchange market , strengthen its currency and cut interest rates .
on friday , prime minister geir haarde said iceland would not take the decision while the finance minister was in washington for annual imf meetings .
the gathering ends on monday .
meanwhile also on monday , a delegation of icelandic central bank and finance ministry officials are leaving for moscow with the hope of securing a loan of some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- .
this has caused disquiet in europe with speculation about moscow 's motives and what price it may extract from iceland , a nato member . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .
" we will provide technical assistance as needed and , in the context of a supportive policy setting , are ready to undertake discussions on possible finance assistance , responding rapidly , " said imf chief dominique strauss-kahn .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the imf offer was important for showing that his country had access to such resources .
" we needed this offer so those who attack us see that we have strong allies and that hungary in not alone , " gyurcsany said .
" we needed this offer so we 'd never have to resort to using it . "

poland 's currency slid against the euro friday morning to 3.638 zlotys compared to 3.452 thursday afternoon and later rose to 3.548 in trading ..
" the weakening of the zloty is linked to the general situation , the withdrawal of capital from emerging markets , but it is also due to rumours surrounding hungary 's otp bank that have weakened the hungarian currency , " mateusz mokrogulski , chief analyst with poland 's bgz bank , told news agency afp friday .
in the czech republic , finance minister miroslav kalousek said his country would now be looking at a longer-term approach to joining the eurozone .

afraid of lending to failing institutions , banks were " keeping liquidity for themselves and it was no longer circulating , " sarkozy told journalists in paris .
“ we have to create conditions to get it moving again . ”
to that end , the french government will create an authority that will guarantee loans for a period of five years , the french president said .
in return , banks will be asked to abide by certain obligations , including the manner in which their executives are paid .
sarkozy has vowed to do away with exorbitant severance payments to executives who have incurred unreasonable risks .
pan-european action the french package forms part of a sweeping , europe-wide , trillion-dollar bailout of banks .
the german government announced its own rescue package monday , which is to include 80 billion euros in fresh capital and 400 billion euros in loan guarantees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a trillion dollars has gone into europe-wide bailout plans announced monday the british government , meanwhile , said it would invest 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros -rrb- in its ailing banks .
when announcing the german bailout package , chancellor angela merkel insisted that international efforts to halt the downward spiral of global finance markets would amount to nought if not accompanied by parallel regulation that would end “ market excesses . ”
“ today 's measures are the first element of a new financial market charter ... but it can only be worthy of the name if it is followed by a second element , namely a change in international rules , " she said after her cabinet approved the package .
likewise , in madrid , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced that the spanish government would set aside a maximum of 100 billion euros to cover interbank loans .
the governments of austria , italy and the netherlands also said they would shore up their banks instant reaction as news of the european bailouts aired , shares rose strongly across the board .
the london ftse 100 index of leading shares gained 8.26 percent , in paris the cac 40 rose 11.18 percent - its largest ever one-day gain - while the frankfurt dax soared 11.40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares worldwide rallied amid news of the european rescue plans the swiss market index gained 11.39 percent , while increases of 11.49 percent in milan and 10.65 percent in madrid were recorded .
in rhetoric aimed at soothing ongoing market fears , sarkozy said the french state would take control of any bank and change its management to prevent it from going bust .
“ the french state will not let any bank fail , " the french president declared .
" the greatest risk now would have been not to be bold , " he said .
" there was no other reasonable choice . "
recession “ unavoidable ” despite the renewed market confidence , dominique barbet , an economist for the french bank bnp paribas , said the proposals to support interbank lending and struggling financial institutions " look okay " but have probably come too late to avoid a recession .
" the problem is that no matter what measures you take you will not avoid a credit crunch , " barbet said .
" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .

germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .

afraid of lending to failing institutions , banks were " keeping liquidity for themselves and it was no longer circulating , " sarkozy told journalists in paris .
“ we have to create conditions to get it moving again . ”
to that end , the french government will create an authority that will guarantee loans for a period of five years , the french president said .
in return , banks will be asked to abide by certain obligations , including the manner in which their executives are paid .
sarkozy has vowed to do away with exorbitant severance payments to executives who have incurred unreasonable risks .
pan-european action the french package forms part of a sweeping , europe-wide , trillion-dollar bailout of banks .
the german government announced its own rescue package monday , which is to include 80 billion euros in fresh capital and 400 billion euros in loan guarantees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a trillion dollars has gone into europe-wide bailout plans announced monday the british government , meanwhile , said it would invest 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros -rrb- in its ailing banks .
when announcing the german bailout package , chancellor angela merkel insisted that international efforts to halt the downward spiral of global finance markets would amount to nought if not accompanied by parallel regulation that would end “ market excesses . ”
“ today 's measures are the first element of a new financial market charter ... but it can only be worthy of the name if it is followed by a second element , namely a change in international rules , " she said after her cabinet approved the package .
likewise , in madrid , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced that the spanish government would set aside a maximum of 100 billion euros to cover interbank loans .
the governments of austria , italy and the netherlands also said they would shore up their banks instant reaction as news of the european bailouts aired , shares rose strongly across the board .
the london ftse 100 index of leading shares gained 8.26 percent , in paris the cac 40 rose 11.18 percent - its largest ever one-day gain - while the frankfurt dax soared 11.40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares worldwide rallied amid news of the european rescue plans the swiss market index gained 11.39 percent , while increases of 11.49 percent in milan and 10.65 percent in madrid were recorded .
in rhetoric aimed at soothing ongoing market fears , sarkozy said the french state would take control of any bank and change its management to prevent it from going bust .
“ the french state will not let any bank fail , " the french president declared .
" the greatest risk now would have been not to be bold , " he said .
" there was no other reasonable choice . "
recession “ unavoidable ” despite the renewed market confidence , dominique barbet , an economist for the french bank bnp paribas , said the proposals to support interbank lending and struggling financial institutions " look okay " but have probably come too late to avoid a recession .
" the problem is that no matter what measures you take you will not avoid a credit crunch , " barbet said .
" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .
however , the current turmoil means we have to look at every option . "
a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .
" negotiation with iceland , theoretically speaking , could go fast because as a member of the european economic area , it has already adopted many eu laws , " a commission official said .
a nation facing bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland fears losing control over its fish stocks iceland was forced over the past week to take over three big banks , shut down its stock market and abandon attempts to defend its free-falling currency .
trading in icelandic shares had been due to start again on monday , sept .
13 , but the exchange said it would now start on tuesday .
foreign minister ingibjorg solrun gisladottir , writing in monday 's edition of the morgunbladid newspaper , said eu accession and the adoption of the euro now had to be a long-term ambition .
gisladottir , a member of the pro-eu social democrat party , also stressed the importance of working with the imf .
" in the short term , our defence is cooperation with the international monetary fund and in the long term eu membership , adoption of the euro and backup from the european central bank , " she wrote .
an approach to the imf is likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been a nightmarish week for iceland 's prime minister on sunday , a top minister gave the strongest signal yet that iceland might seek help from the international monetary fund after the country downplayed the idea last week .
the issue is whether to ask the imf for foreign currency to ensure the flow of imports and to help banks trade again .
" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .
skarphedinsson said that would give iceland the opportunity to rapidly rebuild its foreign exchange market , strengthen its currency and cut interest rates .
on friday , prime minister geir haarde said iceland would not take the decision while the finance minister was in washington for annual imf meetings .
the gathering ends on monday .
meanwhile also on monday , a delegation of icelandic central bank and finance ministry officials are leaving for moscow with the hope of securing a loan of some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- .
this has caused disquiet in europe with speculation about moscow 's motives and what price it may extract from iceland , a nato member . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .

the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .

loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 13.10.2008 eu temporarily lifts travel sanctions on belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko can visit the eu - at least during the next six months a travel ban on belarussian government officials , including on president alexander lukashenko , has been lifted for six months , eu foreign ministers have said . “ we have suspended the travel bans for six months except for those involved in the disappearance of political prisoners , ” one diplomat said after the meeting on monday , oct .
13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?

afraid of lending to failing institutions , banks were " keeping liquidity for themselves and it was no longer circulating , " sarkozy told journalists in paris .
“ we have to create conditions to get it moving again . ”
to that end , the french government will create an authority that will guarantee loans for a period of five years , the french president said .
in return , banks will be asked to abide by certain obligations , including the manner in which their executives are paid .
sarkozy has vowed to do away with exorbitant severance payments to executives who have incurred unreasonable risks .
pan-european action the french package forms part of a sweeping , europe-wide , trillion-dollar bailout of banks .
the german government announced its own rescue package monday , which is to include 80 billion euros in fresh capital and 400 billion euros in loan guarantees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a trillion dollars has gone into europe-wide bailout plans announced monday the british government , meanwhile , said it would invest 37 billion pounds -lrb- 47 billion euros -rrb- in its ailing banks .
when announcing the german bailout package , chancellor angela merkel insisted that international efforts to halt the downward spiral of global finance markets would amount to nought if not accompanied by parallel regulation that would end “ market excesses . ”
“ today 's measures are the first element of a new financial market charter ... but it can only be worthy of the name if it is followed by a second element , namely a change in international rules , " she said after her cabinet approved the package .
likewise , in madrid , prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero announced that the spanish government would set aside a maximum of 100 billion euros to cover interbank loans .
the governments of austria , italy and the netherlands also said they would shore up their banks instant reaction as news of the european bailouts aired , shares rose strongly across the board .
the london ftse 100 index of leading shares gained 8.26 percent , in paris the cac 40 rose 11.18 percent - its largest ever one-day gain - while the frankfurt dax soared 11.40 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shares worldwide rallied amid news of the european rescue plans the swiss market index gained 11.39 percent , while increases of 11.49 percent in milan and 10.65 percent in madrid were recorded .
in rhetoric aimed at soothing ongoing market fears , sarkozy said the french state would take control of any bank and change its management to prevent it from going bust .
“ the french state will not let any bank fail , " the french president declared .
" the greatest risk now would have been not to be bold , " he said .
" there was no other reasonable choice . "
recession “ unavoidable ” despite the renewed market confidence , dominique barbet , an economist for the french bank bnp paribas , said the proposals to support interbank lending and struggling financial institutions " look okay " but have probably come too late to avoid a recession .
" the problem is that no matter what measures you take you will not avoid a credit crunch , " barbet said .
" we are heading for tough economic times . "
but barbet commented , however , that without the bailout action industrial nations would have experienced a depression .
" in this regard , a recession is a kind of best-case scenario . "
benoit debroissia , financial analyst at richelieu finance in paris , agreed , saying that the measures will almost certainly " open the credit faucet , but perhaps they have come too late . "
the problem , he said , was that they may not restore the confidence of households and businesses while the economy is in recession .
" we are looking at a gloomy economic forecast for the end of this year and the beginning of 2009 , " he said .
" so you could have a situation in which credit is available but few will take advantage of it because they are afraid to invest or spend . "
debroissia said that governments may be forced to undertake measures to " re-launch the twin motors of economic growth - household spending and investment " - such as state investment in research and development . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks will have to pay 2 percent interest on loan guarantees setting up the fund will increase germany 's net public borrowing , but the bill states that , initially , none of the money will be budgeted as federal expenditure .
the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .

" banks that have misbehaved on the markets should be held responsible for it , " he said .
others criticized finance minister steinbrueck for apparently abandoning plans to balance the german federal budget by 2011 .
guenther oettinger , the cdu premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , said , " a brake on public debt is just as necessary , even more necessary in the future . "
the mass-circulation newspaper bild had quoted steinbrueck as saying , " we 'll keep our target of balancing the budget in mind , but it 's going to take longer now . "
opposition parties were expected to demand the imposition of tougher conditions on the banks to be rescued .

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .

fisheries minister einar gudfinnsson told icelandic radio on monday : " it 's no secret , i 've been against membership .
however , the current turmoil means we have to look at every option . "
a european commission spokeswoman told reuters news agency that she was not aware of gudfinnsson 's comments but said the eu 's standard position remained that iceland is a european country and thus entitled to apply for eu membership .
" negotiation with iceland , theoretically speaking , could go fast because as a member of the european economic area , it has already adopted many eu laws , " a commission official said .
a nation facing bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland fears losing control over its fish stocks iceland was forced over the past week to take over three big banks , shut down its stock market and abandon attempts to defend its free-falling currency .
trading in icelandic shares had been due to start again on monday , sept .
13 , but the exchange said it would now start on tuesday .
foreign minister ingibjorg solrun gisladottir , writing in monday 's edition of the morgunbladid newspaper , said eu accession and the adoption of the euro now had to be a long-term ambition .
gisladottir , a member of the pro-eu social democrat party , also stressed the importance of working with the imf .
" in the short term , our defence is cooperation with the international monetary fund and in the long term eu membership , adoption of the euro and backup from the european central bank , " she wrote .
an approach to the imf is likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has been a nightmarish week for iceland 's prime minister on sunday , a top minister gave the strongest signal yet that iceland might seek help from the international monetary fund after the country downplayed the idea last week .
the issue is whether to ask the imf for foreign currency to ensure the flow of imports and to help banks trade again .
" my conclusion is that if we appeal to the imf , other central banks and other nations would follow that track , " industry minister ossur skarphedinsson told the morgunbladid newspaper in a report published on its website on sunday .
skarphedinsson said that would give iceland the opportunity to rapidly rebuild its foreign exchange market , strengthen its currency and cut interest rates .
on friday , prime minister geir haarde said iceland would not take the decision while the finance minister was in washington for annual imf meetings .
the gathering ends on monday .
meanwhile also on monday , a delegation of icelandic central bank and finance ministry officials are leaving for moscow with the hope of securing a loan of some four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- .
this has caused disquiet in europe with speculation about moscow 's motives and what price it may extract from iceland , a nato member . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .

the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country of some 10 million was hit hard by the crisis due to its heavy reliance on foreign financing and a high public deficit , which is estimated at 3.8 percent of gdp for 2008 , dropping from 9.2 percent of gdp in 2006 .
hungary 's currency , the forint , plunged to two-year lows against the euro on friday , losing about 10 percent of its value in a day before recovering slightly monday .
the imf said it was prepared to offer financial and technical assistance to hungary if needed , but the government in budapest was adamant the aid would not be needed .
" we will provide technical assistance as needed and , in the context of a supportive policy setting , are ready to undertake discussions on possible finance assistance , responding rapidly , " said imf chief dominique strauss-kahn .
hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said the imf offer was important for showing that his country had access to such resources .
" we needed this offer so those who attack us see that we have strong allies and that hungary in not alone , " gyurcsany said .
" we needed this offer so we 'd never have to resort to using it . "

" " i do n't belong in this line-up , " said marcel reich-ranicki .
" i did n't realize what was waiting for me here , " he added . speaking on camera , he said he loved arte , the publicly funded german-french arts channel , but not this " rubbish . "
reich-raniciki said he had found the three-hour ceremony so " repulsive " that he had spontaneously rejected the award for his life work .
" it 's incredible that something like this should be broadcast , " he said .
the 88-year-old literary critic promptly left the hall after his tirade .
germany 's public television broadcaster zdf left the moment uncut in sunday evening 's broadcast of the event .
reich-ranicki was first an eminent newspaper literary critic before becoming a television personality in 1988 , taking part in a book-review program , " the literary quartet , " that aired for 13 years .
he became a household name , notorious for his irascible reviews and spats with fellow critics .
spotlight falls on german tv standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki 's participation in the literary quartet made him famous the incident looks set to spark a debate about standards in german tv , which has seen a shift away from high-brow , and at times rather staid , programming to tabloid formats over the last decade .
the compere of the awards , top german talk show host thomas gottschalk was momentarily taken aback by reich-ranicki 's reaction , but then he sought to placate the veteran critic , offering to make an hour-long program with him and some german tv bosses to discuss the quality of national television .
reich-ranicki immediately accepted and the plan has been given the green light by zdf .
reportedly the show will take place this week .
on sunday , it was being reported by a number of newspapers that the literary critic had now relented and agreed to accept the award .
talking afterwards to bild.de , the online version of the tabloid newspaper , gottschalk said he could understand the critic 's reaction .
" if i , a simple soul in the prime of my life , have started to despair about the quality of our television , then you can hardly be surprised if an intellectual in his twilight years should take to his heels , " he said .
the talk show host also conceded , however , that if german television was made according to reich-ranicki 's wishes then he would be unemployed . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .
loew spoiled for options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's strike force offers loew a generous platter to choose from loew could afford to release kuranyi as it appears there is no shortage of offensive firepower in the german squad , with lukas podolski , miroslav klose and mario gomez all in the mix for first-team action .
the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .
the welsh have set their sights on an upset come wednesday with memories of their 0-0 draw last year in euro 2008 qualifying still fresh .
germany had already been assured of qualifying at the time , but wales captain criag bellamy is nonetheless upbeat about the upcoming clash .

on wednesday , germany will meet a defense-minded welsh team , with patience likely to be the key .
" wales play differently than russia .
they defend well , are a typical british team , " said germany coach joachim loew on monday .
" our aim is six points from those two games .
the victory against russia would be worth nothing if we lose against wales . "
captain michael ballack is a doubt for for the wales game due to a calf injury he picked up in the 2-1 weekend victory over russia . the 32-year-old chelsea midfielder was unable to take part in training monday and instead received intensive medical treatment . the german soccer federation 's -lrb- dfb -rrb- medical team refused to comment on the chances of ballack recovering in time but the player has suffered from the problem several times in his career .
kuranyi kicks back , apologetically loew did not want to dwell on kuranyi , who was told sunday his services were no longer required by the national team after he left dortmund stadium during halftime of the russia match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke striker kuranyi is both loved and hated having made 52 appearances for germany , kuranyi would have been expected to put faith in loew 's decision to leave him out of the squad to face russia by watching the full match , but now he must live with the knowledge that he will not be selected for national team duties so long as loew is in charge .
the 26-year-old later apologized for walking out during the game , saying at a press conference monday he had faced a difficult situation over the past years " as a player and a human being , " citing , for example , having been omitted from germany 's 2006 world cup squad .
" i told him -lrb- loew -rrb- what i felt over the last three years as a player and as a person .
" i always tried to give it all i had .
it was a very difficult situation .
we had the world cup at home and kevin kuranyi was n't there , " he said , adding that he had had a particularly hard time being jeered by schalke fans , but was hopeful that the dust would soon settle .
kuranyi would n't rule out a return to the national team , but said that decision was up to others .
at a parallel press conference , loew insisted that he " ca n't look after just one player , " and added he " did n't want this situation ... -lrb- but -rrb- the decision has been made and we must look ahead to wednesday . "
" a team is not only made up of 11 players , but of 20 or so .
that is also the case at schalke , " he said .

the starting 11 for the wales clash is yet to be revealed , but loew has said that no player was guaranteed a place based on reputation alone - as was the case with midfielder torsten frings who was benched until late in the game against russia .
loew has several difficult decisions to make with regards his midfield and attack , while bayer leverkusen 's rene adler will feature in goal again after a strong debut against the russians .
germany currently sit atop group 4 with seven points , with wales only one behind after beating liechtenstein 2-0 on saturday .

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "

13 that in the current global financial crisis , those governments that could afford it should consider stimulus plans for their economies . strauss-kahn told the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank in washington that " action in the financial markets is essential , but it is not sufficient .
" we also need to deploy all of the instruments of modern macroeconomic policy to limit the damage to the real economy , " he said .
" for the advanced economies , this means using fiscal policy when they can .
the most obvious use of fiscal policy is precisely to ease pressures where they are greatest : in the financial and housing sectors .
" but governments that can afford it should also be ready to undertake a broader fiscal stimulus , " strauss-kahn added .
fiscal policy stimulus would either be tax cuts or increased government spending .
strauss-kahn was speaking after a weekend of high-level meetings of world economic powers in washington which led to pledges to protect systemically important financial institutions and use all tools to fight the crisis .
the group of seven leading democracies - the united states , britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan - agreed friday to take all necessary measures to tackle the crisis .
that stance was backed by the main committee of the imf and endorsed by the enlarged g20 group of rich and emerging nations that includes brazil , china , india and russia .
it was also picked up at the euro zone meeting on sunday when the 15-nation group unveiled plans to recapitalize their banks and guarantee inter-bank lending , the key source of short-term funding for the finance system .
fast action needed but do n't panic strauss-kahn warned that action had to be taken quickly to avoid the mistakes that led to the great depression of the 1930s but there was also no reason to despair .
" i am confident that we can emerge from this crisis with our economies and societies intact , " he said , calling for steps to prevent more bank failures as part of a comprehensive plan of action .
" in the -lrb- 1930s -rrb- countries acted in a piecemeal way , and were hamstrung by old-fashioned orthodoxies .
instead , we are acting imaginatively , " he said , citing efforts to tackle problems of " liquidity , bad assets , shortages of capital , and especially confidence . "
he said that with the latest government efforts , " things are beginning to turn around " but cautioned that " we still have a very long way to go ...
this weekend is just the beginning of a long effort . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president zoellick warned poor nations robert zoellick , head of the world bank which focuses on development issues , told the meeting that some poorer countries would have to prepare for more difficult times as the crisis bites deeper .
he said october could be tipping point , as developing country exports , capital inflows , investment all come under pressure , leading to business failures and " increase the risk of banking emergencies .
" as is always the case , the most poor are the most defenceless , " he said .
this year 's meetings were taking place " at an extraordinarily difficult time - a time of uncertainty and insecurity , with a danger that those fears push us away from - not towards - a more inclusive and sustainable globalization , " zoellick said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation , therefore authorizes the finance ministry to borrow funds to the value of the 5 percent - some 20 billion euros - to counter-balance that eventuality .
chancellor angela merkel was expected to announce germany 's role in the coordinated european rescue at a 3 pm news conference , with her finance minister to issue details half an hour later .
banks rescued a state fund - the german financial market stabilization fund - would be set up to inject 80 billions euros into german banks and purchase their troubled assets .
the ministry would be authorized to borrow 70 billion euros for that fund .
that sum is about 50 percent more than the stabilization fund announced monday in london for leading british banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks will have to pay 2 percent interest on loan guarantees setting up the fund will increase germany 's net public borrowing , but the bill states that , initially , none of the money will be budgeted as federal expenditure .
the new fund will offer to take over tainted securities , mainly derivatives , provided they were on the banks ' books as of monday .
the time limit prevents the banks from buying junk securities and passing them on to the german government at a higher price .
the fund will have leeway to grow by an additional 10 billion euros if need be .
the banks would be required to show they were pursuing " careful " business plans and the government would have power to set caps on pay for their executives and supervisory boards .
in addition the draft bill authorizes the german state to guarantee interbank trading .
loan guarantees the finance ministry would have the power to extend guarantees totalling 400 billion euros up to december 31 , 2009 .
banks would have to pay a fee of 2 percent per annum for such guarantees .
sources said merkel and the two leading social democrats in her coalition government , finance minister peer steinbrueck and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , agreed in the night on the basics of the plan .
the cabinet was to meet monday , with the pro-merkel parties , which have an overwhelming majority in the bundestag lower chamber , expected to move the legislation tuesday .
passage by saturday is feasible if there is no opposition .
package still criticized signs were emerging monday of criticism of the terms of the rescue , which follows a 50-million-euro mixed public-private bail-out last week for german mortgage lender hypo real estate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck 's plans to balance germany 's budget are now on hold one christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- state premier , peter mueller of saarland state , welcomed the package , but said he favoured a cap on state aid to the banks .
" banks that have misbehaved on the markets should be held responsible for it , " he said .
others criticized finance minister steinbrueck for apparently abandoning plans to balance the german federal budget by 2011 .
guenther oettinger , the cdu premier of baden-wuerttemberg state , said , " a brake on public debt is just as necessary , even more necessary in the future . "
the mass-circulation newspaper bild had quoted steinbrueck as saying , " we 'll keep our target of balancing the budget in mind , but it 's going to take longer now . "
opposition parties were expected to demand the imposition of tougher conditions on the banks to be rescued .
on n-tv television , greens co-leader reinhard buetikofer , said , " the government ca n't expect to be given a blank cheque . " dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world 's brussels correspondent , bernd riegert , hopes it hasn ’ t come too late for the economic future of the eu . shocked by stock market losses around the world and the frightening premonition that european banks may become victims in a possible core meltdown of the world 's financial systems , the most important politicians in europe have finally come together to create a collective plan .
they realized at last that bank managers and customers need to regain trust in the system – and that the only way to do that is through transparency and a clear message .
the 15 eu member states that comprise the eurozone have , along with great britain , simultaneously adopted provisions to help save the financial system from collapse .
they 've also decided which bills must be paid by the individual governments for its banks .
did the economic storm grow worse ?
just one week ago , at the first crisis summit in paris , that insight was n't possible .
the violence created by the economic storm over the last week , however , swept away the concerns - after a valuable week was already lost .
it 's clear now that the eu states want to overcome the crisis .
by partially nationalizing the banks and guaranteeing credit lines for banks , they follow in the footsteps of sweden , which successfully contained a local financial crisis in the 90s with these measures .
that lifesaving packet did n't cost the swedish government much in the long run , as it saved the banks from drowning .
but no one can truly predict if that recipe will be successful in the worldwide crisis with all its swift and dramatic twists and turns .
in the short term , the eu states have to mobilize billions .
the worst case scenario : trillions in guaranties coming due in the eu alone .
this is unprecedented .
politicians must now make decisions that they 've never been faced with before .
the states themselves have to borrow money if they want to avoid paying special taxes .
or they have to print new money , which would lead to enormous inflation and greater depreciation for the individual savers .
whichever way one looks at it , if the european union 's plan fails , the european citizenry pays the bill in the long run .
can a country go broke ?
in view of the staggering sums , one has to ask : can a country go broke ?
it can .
germany has done so twice before - after both the first and the second world war .
only currency reforms made new beginnings possible for the country .
with the euro , however , those reforms can no longer occur - the 15 eurozone countries are inseparably bonded .
what 's most remarkable about this latest meeting was just how quickly president sarkozy and chancellor merkel seem to have reconciled to fight this issue together .
that shows just how great the threat to the european economy actually is .
now that they 've announced their plan , the gaze has shifted and everyone 's looking to the stock exchanges to see if the politicians have been able to restore confidence .
will they reward the politicians for their troubles ?
ahead of wednesday 's next eu crisis summit , fingers are crossed .
when the storm clouds pass , though , europe has to show the world that there is uniform regulation in the financial sector .
great britain , which has particularly held up regulation , has laced up the largest aid package .
we ca n't leave our money to unregulated funds , incompetent bank managers and greedy speculators any longer . bernd riegert -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 13.10.2008 eu temporarily lifts travel sanctions on belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko can visit the eu - at least during the next six months a travel ban on belarussian government officials , including on president alexander lukashenko , has been lifted for six months , eu foreign ministers have said . “ we have suspended the travel bans for six months except for those involved in the disappearance of political prisoners , ” one diplomat said after the meeting on monday , oct .
13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .
the eu most recently showed dissatisfaction with elections last month won hands down by lukashenko allies .
it was believed to have been heavily manipulated . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .

prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .
the eu most recently showed dissatisfaction with elections last month won hands down by lukashenko allies .
it was believed to have been heavily manipulated . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 in luxembourg .
the easing of visa restrictions on belarussian officials followed the release of the last three political prisoners by the government there , and its non-recognition of the independence of georgia 's two breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia , which many in the west saw as an effort by minsk to appear more open to the eu .
a block on the assets of belarussian officials in europe would , however , remain in place , diplomats said .
the eu also said it would lift standing sanctions , including visa bans , on central asian state uzbekistan after observing progress on human rights there .
prickly relations the european union has had a problematic relationship with belarus since lukashenko won power in 1994 , with the current government being described by the us in 2005 as “ the last dictatorship in europe . ”
in 1997 , eu foreign ministers cut all non-humanitarian and non-democracy-related aid to the ex-soviet state , and decreed that only the eu 's central organs would be authorized to meet with belarussian ministers .
then , following a crackdown by lukashenko 's government in 2002 on the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , a visa ban was imposed on eight top officials , including the president .
that ban was lifted in 2004 after minsk allowed the opening of an osce office , but then reissued in april 2006 following a presidential election that was largely seen as rigged .
minsk was also accused of covering up the disappearance of four pro-democracy figures in 1999-2000 and of attacking demonstrators in 2004 and 2006 .
in may 2006 , the european assets of top regime figures were frozen , and in october of that year the net was cast further to nail down the assets of still more belarussian officials .
the current freeze list includes the education , information and justice ministers , the head of state television and radio broadcaster , and the heads of the prosecution service and security police .
the eu most recently showed dissatisfaction with elections last month won hands down by lukashenko allies .
it was believed to have been heavily manipulated . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly 200 countries signed up to the target in 2002 .
ten leading conservationists asked here at the world conservation congress were unanimous that the goal can not be met .
all the global indicators of progress are heading in the wrong direction , and few governments have even translated the target into national legislation .
not all the experts questioned would go on the record , and some said there was a reluctance to embarrass governments over their failures on the matter .
others suggested the target was unachievable even at its inception six years ago .
ahmed djoghlaf , executive secretary of the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- , told bbc news that the 2010 target was achievable if governments acted urgently , but conceded that " all indicators are telling us it is unlikely " .
last week saw the publication of the red list of threatened species , showing that between a quarter and a third of mammals are at risk of extinction .
it also saw the head of an eu-commissioned review into the economics of biodiversity loss say that degradation of forests worldwide cost the global economy more each year than the current banking crisis .
measured approach the cbd was agreed at the rio earth summit in 1992 , but not until 10 years afterwards did it acquire a firm , supposedly binding target - " to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global , regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on earth " . "
virtually all of the trends that drive the loss of species and ecosystems are continuing at a global level " georgina mace , director of the centre for population biology at imperial college london , said that on the worldwide basis there was absolutely no chance of achieving it .
" we do n't have many measures of biodiversity at a global level , but there are a few , " she said .
" they measure things like the rate at which species are moving down the categories of threat on the red list towards extinction , they measure average trends in various populations that have been measured over time , they measure trends on habitat change . "
" and at global level , all those data that we have show either continuing downward rates of loss or maybe continuing rates of loss - so some of them are n't getting worse , some are just staying at the same rate of loss - but none of them are getting better , " she added .
in addition , virtually all of the trends that drive the loss of species and ecosystems are continuing at a global level .
" the biodiversity convention does n't deal with cross-cutting issues such as logging , road building , climate change , pollution and the expansion of agriculture , " said gordon shepherd , director of global policy at the environmental group wwf .
" in reality the people who own decision-making in those areas , be they in governments or in business , have much more power than environment ministers , who do n't have tools to get to grips with over-use -lsb- of natural resources -rsb- or over-consumption . "
political paths however , sebastian winkler from the international union for the conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- said the time period from 2002 to 2010 was so short that we should not have expected to see any changes in the real world .
he suggested a different way of measuring the lack of progress - that only 16 governments have followed through on their commitment to integrate the 2010 target into national plans for tackling biodiversity loss .
mr winkler runs an iucn initiative called countdown 2010 , which aims to engage stakeholders across the world such as local authorities and get them to commit to actions that could improve prospects in their own regions .
" now the cdb is trying to use countdown 2010 as a fig leaf for governments - we have 800 partners , they 're each taking at least 10 actions , so that 's 8,000 actions and that 's what they hope to report back as progress , " he said .
by march next year , governments must submit assessments of their own progress to the cbd , which will compile them into a global assessment .
sweet dreams thomas lovejoy , president of the washington dc-based think-tank , the heinz center , said there were signs of progress in different corners of the world , citing costa rica and bhutan among countries that were taking the issue seriously . "
there 's no longer a question whether there will be a sixth major extinction in earth history .
it 's already happening , and the question is how big we 'll allow it to get " thomas lovejoy president , heinz center " in 43 years we 've gone from one protected forest in the amazon to 40 % of the area under some form of protection , " he said .
" it 's not enough to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem but it 's a huge achievement . "
europe is the continent which has made most progress towards the target .
according to one recent study , it is on course to curb biodiversity loss - but by 2050 , rather than 2010 .
mr djoghlaf said the 2010 initiative had at least put the issue of natural decline into the political and public spotlight .
" there is more and more increased awareness , people are ready to be engaged , business behaviour is changing , biodiversity is becoming a business case because businesses know the market of tomorrow is green , and they have to adapt , " he said .
most of the other leading figures i spoke to here about the issue were not willing to go on the record , although all said in private there was no chance of achieving the target .
sebastian winkler said it was important to keep governments engaged with the issue .
" martin luther king said ' i have a dream ' , not ' i have a nightmare ' , " he said .
" and if we always paint nightmares , we will not engage the international community . "
but mr lovejoy suggested that at the level of species and ecosystems , the nightmare was already unfolding .
" there 's no longer a question whether there will be a sixth major extinction in earth history , " he said .
" it 's already happening , and the question is how big we 'll allow it to get . "

nearly 200 countries signed up to the target in 2002 .
ten leading conservationists asked here at the world conservation congress were unanimous that the goal can not be met .
all the global indicators of progress are heading in the wrong direction , and few governments have even translated the target into national legislation .
not all the experts questioned would go on the record , and some said there was a reluctance to embarrass governments over their failures on the matter .
others suggested the target was unachievable even at its inception six years ago .
ahmed djoghlaf , executive secretary of the un convention on biological diversity -lrb- cbd -rrb- , told bbc news that the 2010 target was achievable if governments acted urgently , but conceded that " all indicators are telling us it is unlikely " .
last week saw the publication of the red list of threatened species , showing that between a quarter and a third of mammals are at risk of extinction .
it also saw the head of an eu-commissioned review into the economics of biodiversity loss say that degradation of forests worldwide cost the global economy more each year than the current banking crisis .
measured approach the cbd was agreed at the rio earth summit in 1992 , but not until 10 years afterwards did it acquire a firm , supposedly binding target - " to achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global , regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on earth " .
virtually all of the trends that drive the loss of species and ecosystems are continuing at a global level georgina mace , director of the centre for population biology at imperial college london , said that on the worldwide basis there was absolutely no chance of achieving it .
" we do n't have many measures of biodiversity at a global level , but there are a few , " she said .
" they measure things like the rate at which species are moving down the categories of threat on the red list towards extinction , they measure average trends in various populations that have been measured over time , they measure trends on habitat change . "
" and at global level , all those data that we have show either continuing downward rates of loss or maybe continuing rates of loss - so some of them are n't getting worse , some are just staying at the same rate of loss - but none of them are getting better , " she added .
in addition , virtually all of the trends that drive the loss of species and ecosystems are continuing at a global level .
" the biodiversity convention does n't deal with cross-cutting issues such as logging , road building , climate change , pollution and the expansion of agriculture , " said gordon shepherd , director of global policy at the environmental group wwf .
" in reality the people who own decision-making in those areas , be they in governments or in business , have much more power than environment ministers , who do n't have tools to get to grips with over-use -lsb- of natural resources -rsb- or over-consumption . "
political paths however , sebastian winkler from the international union for the conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- said the time period from 2002 to 2010 was so short that we should not have expected to see any changes in the real world .
he suggested a different way of measuring the lack of progress - that only 16 governments have followed through on their commitment to integrate the 2010 target into national plans for tackling biodiversity loss .
some experts say the target set by the convention was too ambitious mr winkler runs an iucn initiative called countdown 2010 , which aims to engage stakeholders across the world such as local authorities and get them to commit to actions that could improve prospects in their own regions .
" now the cdb is trying to use countdown 2010 as a fig leaf for governments - we have 800 partners , they 're each taking at least 10 actions , so that 's 8,000 actions and that 's what they hope to report back as progress , " he said .
by march next year , governments must submit assessments of their own progress to the cbd , which will compile them into a global assessment .
sweet dreams thomas lovejoy , president of the washington dc-based think-tank , the heinz center , said there were signs of progress in different corners of the world , citing costa rica and bhutan among countries that were taking the issue seriously .
there 's no longer a question whether there will be a sixth major extinction in earth history .
it 's already happening , and the question is how big we 'll allow it to get thomas lovejoy president , heinz center " in 43 years we 've gone from one protected forest in the amazon to 40 % of the area under some form of protection , " he said .
" it 's not enough to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem but it 's a huge achievement . "
europe is the continent which has made most progress towards the target .
according to one recent study , it is on course to curb biodiversity loss - but by 2050 , rather than 2010 .
mr djoghlaf said the 2010 initiative had at least put the issue of natural decline into the political and public spotlight .
" there is more and more increased awareness , people are ready to be engaged , business behaviour is changing , biodiversity is becoming a business case because businesses know the market of tomorrow is green , and they have to adapt , " he said .
most of the other leading figures i spoke to here about the issue were not willing to go on the record , although all said in private there was no chance of achieving the target .
sebastian winkler said it was important to keep governments engaged with the issue .
" martin luther king said ' i have a dream ' , not ' i have a nightmare ' , " he said .
" and if we always paint nightmares , we will not engage the international community . "
but mr lovejoy suggested that at the level of species and ecosystems , the nightmare was already unfolding .
" there 's no longer a question whether there will be a sixth major extinction in earth history , " he said .
" it 's already happening , and the question is how big we 'll allow it to get . "

advertisement this timelapse footage shows japanese knotweed growing more than 1m-tall -lrb- 3ft -rrb- in just four weeks a superweed spreading throughout the uk could be brought under control by introducing plant-eating predators from japan , scientists believe .
japanese knotweed was first introduced as an ornamental plant , but has since plagued the environment ; removal is costly and time consuming .
now a team has identified natural predators from its native home that could also control it in the uk .
the plans have been submitted to the government for approval .
if the proposal gets the go-ahead , it will be the first time that biocontrol - the use of a natural enemy to control another pest - will be used in europe to fight a weed .
all this week , bbc news will be taking a closer look at some of the alien invaders that are in the uk .
appetite for knotweed this year has been particularly bad for knotweed spread in the uk .
the nymphs are literally sucking the life out of the plant .
dr shaw , cabi james macfarlane , vegetation adviser for cornwall county council , said : " the weather patterns have ended up with us seeing a lot of knotweed spread in a number of areas . "

advertisement this timelapse footage shows japanese knotweed growing more than 1m-tall -lrb- 3ft -rrb- in just four weeks a superweed spreading throughout the uk could be brought under control by introducing plant-eating predators from japan , scientists believe .
japanese knotweed was first introduced as an ornamental plant , but has since plagued the environment ; removal is costly and time consuming .
now a team has identified natural predators from its native home that could also control it in the uk .
the plans have been submitted to the government for approval .
if the proposal gets the go-ahead , it will be the first time that biocontrol - the use of a natural enemy to control another pest - will be used in europe to fight a weed .
all this week , bbc news will be taking a closer look at some of the alien invaders that are in the uk .
appetite for knotweed this year has been particularly bad for knotweed spread in the uk .
the nymphs are literally sucking the life out of the plant .
dr shaw , cabi james macfarlane , vegetation adviser for cornwall county council , said : " the weather patterns have ended up with us seeing a lot of knotweed spread in a number of areas . "
in japan , the original home of knotweed , the plant is common but it does not rage out of control like in the uk .
dick shaw , the lead researcher on the project , from cabi , a not-for-profit agricultural research organisation , said : " in 2000 , we went out to japan to see whether the plant had any natural enemies that it had lost when it came here .
" we found that it had a lot : there were 186 species of plant-eating insects and about 40 species of fungi . "
the team then began to test the predators to find those that only had an appetite for japanese knotweed - and not any other plants .
the researchers tempted them with plant species that were very closely related to knotweed , less closely related species that belonged to the same tribe or family , and important uk plants such as apples and wheat .
a leaf sport fungus only has an appetite for knotweed those that attacked any plants other than japanese knotweed were ruled out , explained dr shaw .
eventually , the list was whittled down to two : a sap-sucking psyllid insect -lrb- aphalara itadori -rrb- and a leaf spot fungus from the genus mycosphaerella .
dr shaw told the bbc : " we have done some efficacy trials here in the lab and they are showing a significant impact . "

advertisement dick shaw shows the effects of the sap-sucking psyllid on japanese knotweed .
successful biocontrols do not eradicate the target weed - this would mean wiping out their only food source and effectively making themselves extinct - but they do bring them under control .
dr shaw said : " the psyllids are having an effect on the plants ' height and the treated knotweeds produce tiny curled leaves rather than big light absorbing leaves , which means that less resources will get to their root system .
" the nymphs are literally sucking the life out of the plant , " he added .
phenomenal growth japanese knotweed , like many other non-native , invasive plants , was first introduced to the uk for horticulture .
its 3-4m-tall -lrb- 10-13ft -rrb- stems , ornamental leaves and clusters of white flowers made it an attractive option for gardens .
simon ford , a nature conservation adviser from the national trust , said : " japanese knotweed first came into the uk in 1840 through wales - but it was only about 10 to 15 years later that people started to see it as a threat . "
the plants grow incredibly quickly - some have been shown to grow four metres in just four months , they can spread at a tremendous rate , and they can quickly obliterate any other vegetation growing nearby .
mr ford said : " by the time they realised this it was already far too late . "
today , japanese knotweed is prevalent throughout the uk .
it has not only caused great damage to plant biodiversity but it is also causing problems for hard structures , including buildings , paving stones and flood defence structures .
is there an alien in your garden ?
alien invasion hits the uk it has been estimated that to remove all knotweed from the uk would cost several billion pounds .
cabi scientists believe that natural control could offer a much simpler solution .
the project has cost about £ 600,000 over five years .
dr shaw said : " in comparison to the current control methods , if it works , this will be significantly less costly . "
the team has submitted its proposals to the government .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- along with independent peer reviewers will assess the work before it is submitted for a public consultation .
have your say what is more alarming is the idea of introducing an insect into the wild to eat the j.k. weed james paul , united kingdom send us your comments dr shaw said : " we do not know if this is going to be the silver bullet for knotweed , but if we were able to just stop the thing spreading at the rate it currently is , or make it easier to kill , i will be very happy . "
the research project has been paid for by a consortium of uk sponsors including defra , the environment agency , the welsh assembly government , network rail , south west regional development agency and british waterways , coordinated by cornwall county council .

at the heart of the stalemate is the tension between dutch speakers and francophones .
in the fourth of a series of articles on belgium 's linguistic rift , henri astier considers how if affects immigrants .
when natasha biryukova arrived in liege from moscow in 1995 , she was shocked to find out that her new homeland was not really belgium , but rather french-speaking wallonia .
" i came from the former ussr , and knew how people lived in uzbekistan thousands of miles away , " she says .
" but now , when i turn on my tv i only know what 's happening in wallonia . "
she said people there know nothing about the lives of their flemish neighbours just a few miles north .
ms biryukova is not alone .
immigrants settling in belgium end up on either side of a fault line that baffles many .
" foreigners did not study belgian history at school - whether they are in wallonia or flanders , for them , this is belgium , " says palestinian-born hamdan al damiri of cripel , an immigrant centre in liege . "
we do n't want to take a position in the dispute between french and dutch speakers , but we often do n't have a choice " naima charkaoui minderhedenforum " people are surprised that belgians squabble over language and other issues - especially in this globalised world . "
the divide is all the more awkward for newcomers as they get drawn into belgium 's particular brand of identity politics .
" we do n't want to take a position in the dispute between french and dutch speakers , but we often do n't have a choice , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , an umbrella group for immigrant associations in flanders .
" we are caught in the middle . "
tongue-tied language , a challenge for all exiles , is a particularly sensitive issue in flanders .
dutch is the single official language - although the rule is not evenly enforced . "
when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it " olivier somwa , accountant congolese-born , liege fatma pehlivan , ghent 's deputy mayor , used french , turkish , and arabic during her campaign , ignoring complaints .
" if i need chinese to communicate with people , i will use chinese , " she says .
still , in many municipalities dealings with officials are in dutch only .
and across flanders skilled workers must pass stringent language tests to have their qualifications recognised .
many feel the bar is set too high .
olivier somwa was an accountant in the democratic republic of congo when he arrived in antwerp in 1998 .
he spent two years learning dutch but failed the test , and had to become a farm worker .
" when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it , " says mr somwa , who eventually found an accounting job in liege .
the tough language requirements are not aimed at keeping immigrants out .
flanders ' booming economy needs foreign hands .
the region has a vibrant multicultural scene and subsidises all kinds of community groups .
the real reason for flemish linguistic punctiliousness lies not in xenophobia , but in the troubled history of belgium .
francophones used to run the country - and indeed its empire , which is why mr somwa of dr congo spoke french rather than dutch .
the defence of a long-suppressed language is pivotal to flemish identity .
" some politicians tell us : ' it 's french speakers we are targeting ' - but when people are not native dutch speakers , they are put in the same category as french speakers , " says ms charkaoui .
" the main victims are those in a vulnerable situation - immigrants who struggle to make a living and may find it difficult to attend language classes . "
trapped furthermore , those applying for social housing in flanders must prove that they either speak dutch or are enrolled in a course to learn it .
in some towns language conditions are even stricter .
some - especially older immigrants - find them discriminatory .
tarik poyraz , a 17-year-old student from brussels , says learning another language is beyond his turkish parents , who are already struggling with french .
as a result , he says , his family is unable to escape the capital and its rising housing costs .
" we would like to move to -lsb- the northern suburb of -rsb- vilvoorde , where houses are cheaper , but we ca n't because they want us to speak dutch , " he says .
another peculiarity of flemish-style integration is the civic courses new immigrants have to take to learn the values of the host country .
" it was a waste of time , " says gezim bala , a 27-year-old albanian who studies medicine in ghent .
" i studied at school for 18 years and they were telling me to throw rubbish in the bin , not on the street . "
minderhedenforum 's naima charkaoui feels the courses should take the immigrants ' levels of education into account , but that they are on the whole a good thing .
however she objects to the rhetoric of sanctions that surrounds them .
" you can be fined thousands of euros if you skip lessons , " she says .
" there is no need for such threats . "
all dutch to them wallonia , by contrast , is relaxed about integrating foreigners , and has no mandatory courses . "
by law -lsb- brussels officials -rsb- are supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune " jaco van der merwe south african , brussels buoyed by an international language , walloons assume that new immigrants will fit in , just as earlier generations of southern and eastern european immigrants found a place in wallonia 's old industrial heartland .
but francophone casualness about language is precisely what some immigrants find problematic - notably in the officially bilingual but largely french-speaking capital .
jaco van der merwe , a south african who has been living in belgium for 10 years and has children there , is applying for citizenship .
he speaks only english and dutch and has a " big problem " with authorities in central brussels , where he lives .
" by law they 're supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune , " he says .
setting an example ultimately , immigrants are much more removed from the single entity that belgium remains than native on both sides are . "
most foreigners do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see " yakup uzun turkish-born , brussels even flemish nationalists have a keen sense of shared history with francophones - if just to dwell on past slights - and many speak perfect french .
but newcomers have no such awareness .
" in my two years here i 've met very few walloons , " says talha gokmen , 26 , who studies chemistry in ghent .
" wallonia for me is a different country - just like france . "
some do not see the point of keeping the country together , and reflect common prejudices about the other side .
" they should separate wallonia from flanders , " says one female iranian student in ghent .
" the flemish are hard-working and they keep their land clean .
i have n't been to wallonia much , but do n't feel safe there . "
yakup uzun , a 27-year-old turk who has lived in both wallonia and flanders , says most foreigners in belgium " do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see " .
and many do n't like what they see .
ivorian-born charles yao konan , 34 - and who comes from another country divided between north and south - wonders why the two can not work out an agreement .
" developed countries are supposed to show a democratic example to developing countries - especially belgium , which is the capital of europe , " he says .

at the heart of the stalemate is the tension between dutch speakers and francophones .
in the fourth of a series of articles on belgium 's linguistic rift , henri astier considers how if affects immigrants .
ms biryukova says walloons know little about their flemish neighbours when natasha biryukova arrived in liege from moscow in 1995 , she was shocked to find out that her new homeland was not really belgium , but rather french-speaking wallonia .
" i came from the former ussr , and knew how people lived in uzbekistan thousands of miles away , " she says .
" but now , when i turn on my tv i only know what 's happening in wallonia . "
she said people there know nothing about the lives of their flemish neighbours just a few miles north .
ms biryukova is not alone .
immigrants settling in belgium end up on either side of a fault line that baffles many .
" foreigners did not study belgian history at school - whether they are in wallonia or flanders , for them , this is belgium , " says palestinian-born hamdan al damiri of cripel , an immigrant centre in liege .

the divide is all the more awkward for newcomers as they get drawn into belgium 's particular brand of identity politics .
" we do n't want to take a position in the dispute between french and dutch speakers , but we often do n't have a choice , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , an umbrella group for immigrant associations in flanders .
" we are caught in the middle . "
tongue-tied language , a challenge for all exiles , is a particularly sensitive issue in flanders .
dutch is the single official language - although the rule is not evenly enforced .
when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it olivier somwa , accountant congolese-born , liege fatma pehlivan , ghent 's deputy mayor , used french , turkish , and arabic during her campaign , ignoring complaints .

still , in many municipalities dealings with officials are in dutch only .
and across flanders skilled workers must pass stringent language tests to have their qualifications recognised .
many feel the bar is set too high .
olivier somwa was an accountant in the democratic republic of congo when he arrived in antwerp in 1998 .
he spent two years learning dutch but failed the test , and had to become a farm worker .
" when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it , " says mr somwa , who eventually found an accounting job in liege .
the tough language requirements are not aimed at keeping immigrants out .
flanders ' booming economy needs foreign hands .
the region has a vibrant multicultural scene and subsidises all kinds of community groups .
the real reason for flemish linguistic punctiliousness lies not in xenophobia , but in the troubled history of belgium .
francophones used to run the country - and indeed its empire , which is why mr somwa of dr congo spoke french rather than dutch .
the defence of a long-suppressed language is pivotal to flemish identity .
" some politicians tell us : ' it 's french speakers we are targeting ' - but when people are not native dutch speakers , they are put in the same category as french speakers , " says ms charkaoui .
" the main victims are those in a vulnerable situation - immigrants who struggle to make a living and may find it difficult to attend language classes . "
trapped furthermore , those applying for social housing in flanders must prove that they either speak dutch or are enrolled in a course to learn it .
in some towns language conditions are even stricter .
some - especially older immigrants - find them discriminatory .
some companies in liege are now fully aware of the immigrant market tarik poyraz , a 17-year-old student from brussels , says learning another language is beyond his turkish parents , who are already struggling with french .
as a result , he says , his family is unable to escape the capital and its rising housing costs .
" we would like to move to -lsb- the northern suburb of -rsb- vilvoorde , where houses are cheaper , but we ca n't because they want us to speak dutch , " he says .
another peculiarity of flemish-style integration is the civic courses new immigrants have to take to learn the values of the host country .
" it was a waste of time , " says gezim bala , a 27-year-old albanian who studies medicine in ghent .
" i studied at school for 18 years and they were telling me to throw rubbish in the bin , not on the street . "
minderhedenforum 's naima charkaoui feels the courses should take the immigrants ' levels of education into account , but that they are on the whole a good thing .
however she objects to the rhetoric of sanctions that surrounds them .
" you can be fined thousands of euros if you skip lessons , " she says .
" there is no need for such threats . "
all dutch to them wallonia , by contrast , is relaxed about integrating foreigners , and has no mandatory courses .
by law -lsb- brussels officials -rsb- are supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune jaco van der merwe south african , brussels buoyed by an international language , walloons assume that new immigrants will fit in , just as earlier generations of southern and eastern european immigrants found a place in wallonia 's old industrial heartland .
but francophone casualness about language is precisely what some immigrants find problematic - notably in the officially bilingual but largely french-speaking capital .
jaco van der merwe , a south african who has been living in belgium for 10 years and has children there , is applying for citizenship .
he speaks only english and dutch and has a " big problem " with authorities in central brussels , where he lives .
" by law they 're supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune , " he says .
setting an example ultimately , immigrants are much more removed from the single entity that belgium remains than native on both sides are .
most foreigners do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see yakup uzun turkish-born , brussels even flemish nationalists have a keen sense of shared history with francophones - if just to dwell on past slights - and many speak perfect french .
but newcomers have no such awareness .
" in my two years here i 've met very few walloons , " says talha gokmen , 26 , who studies chemistry in ghent .
" wallonia for me is a different country - just like france . "
some do not see the point of keeping the country together , and reflect common prejudices about the other side .
" they should separate wallonia from flanders , " says one female iranian student in ghent .
" the flemish are hard-working and they keep their land clean .
i have n't been to wallonia much , but do n't feel safe there . "
yakup uzun , a 27-year-old turk who has lived in both wallonia and flanders , says most foreigners in belgium " do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see " .
and many do n't like what they see .
ivorian-born charles yao konan , 34 - and who comes from another country divided between north and south - wonders why the two can not work out an agreement .
" developed countries are supposed to show a democratic example to developing countries - especially belgium , which is the capital of europe , " he says .

at the heart of the stalemate is the tension between dutch speakers and francophones .
in the fourth of a series of articles on belgium 's linguistic rift , henri astier considers how if affects immigrants .
ms biryukova says walloons know little about their flemish neighbours when natasha biryukova arrived in liege from moscow in 1995 , she was shocked to find out that her new homeland was not really belgium , but rather french-speaking wallonia .
" i came from the former ussr , and knew how people lived in uzbekistan thousands of miles away , " she says .
" but now , when i turn on my tv i only know what 's happening in wallonia . "
she said people there know nothing about the lives of their flemish neighbours just a few miles north .
ms biryukova is not alone .
immigrants settling in belgium end up on either side of a fault line that baffles many .
" foreigners did not study belgian history at school - whether they are in wallonia or flanders , for them , this is belgium , " says palestinian-born hamdan al damiri of cripel , an immigrant centre in liege .

the divide is all the more awkward for newcomers as they get drawn into belgium 's particular brand of identity politics .
" we do n't want to take a position in the dispute between french and dutch speakers , but we often do n't have a choice , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , an umbrella group for immigrant associations in flanders .
" we are caught in the middle . "
tongue-tied language , a challenge for all exiles , is a particularly sensitive issue in flanders .
dutch is the single official language - although the rule is not evenly enforced .

still , in many municipalities dealings with officials are in dutch only .

many feel the bar is set too high .
olivier somwa was an accountant in the democratic republic of congo when he arrived in antwerp in 1998 .
he spent two years learning dutch but failed the test , and had to become a farm worker .
" when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it , " says mr somwa , who eventually found an accounting job in liege .
the tough language requirements are not aimed at keeping immigrants out .
flanders ' booming economy needs foreign hands .
the region has a vibrant multicultural scene and subsidises all kinds of community groups .
the real reason for flemish linguistic punctiliousness lies not in xenophobia , but in the troubled history of belgium .
francophones used to run the country - and indeed its empire , which is why mr somwa of dr congo spoke french rather than dutch .
the defence of a long-suppressed language is pivotal to flemish identity .
" some politicians tell us : ' it 's french speakers we are targeting ' - but when people are not native dutch speakers , they are put in the same category as french speakers , " says ms charkaoui .
" the main victims are those in a vulnerable situation - immigrants who struggle to make a living and may find it difficult to attend language classes . "
trapped furthermore , those applying for social housing in flanders must prove that they either speak dutch or are enrolled in a course to learn it .
in some towns language conditions are even stricter .
some - especially older immigrants - find them discriminatory .
some companies in liege are now fully aware of the immigrant market tarik poyraz , a 17-year-old student from brussels , says learning another language is beyond his turkish parents , who are already struggling with french .
as a result , he says , his family is unable to escape the capital and its rising housing costs .
" we would like to move to -lsb- the northern suburb of -rsb- vilvoorde , where houses are cheaper , but we ca n't because they want us to speak dutch , " he says .
another peculiarity of flemish-style integration is the civic courses new immigrants have to take to learn the values of the host country .
" it was a waste of time , " says gezim bala , a 27-year-old albanian who studies medicine in ghent .
" i studied at school for 18 years and they were telling me to throw rubbish in the bin , not on the street . "
minderhedenforum 's naima charkaoui feels the courses should take the immigrants ' levels of education into account , but that they are on the whole a good thing .
however she objects to the rhetoric of sanctions that surrounds them .
" you can be fined thousands of euros if you skip lessons , " she says .
" there is no need for such threats . "
all dutch to them wallonia , by contrast , is relaxed about integrating foreigners , and has no mandatory courses .
by law -lsb- brussels officials -rsb- are supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune jaco van der merwe south african , brussels buoyed by an international language , walloons assume that new immigrants will fit in , just as earlier generations of southern and eastern european immigrants found a place in wallonia 's old industrial heartland .
but francophone casualness about language is precisely what some immigrants find problematic - notably in the officially bilingual but largely french-speaking capital .
jaco van der merwe , a south african who has been living in belgium for 10 years and has children there , is applying for citizenship .
he speaks only english and dutch and has a " big problem " with authorities in central brussels , where he lives .
" by law they 're supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune , " he says .
setting an example ultimately , immigrants are much more removed from the single entity that belgium remains than native on both sides are .
most foreigners do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see yakup uzun turkish-born , brussels even flemish nationalists have a keen sense of shared history with francophones - if just to dwell on past slights - and many speak perfect french .
but newcomers have no such awareness .
" in my two years here i 've met very few walloons , " says talha gokmen , 26 , who studies chemistry in ghent .
" wallonia for me is a different country - just like france . "
some do not see the point of keeping the country together , and reflect common prejudices about the other side .
" they should separate wallonia from flanders , " says one female iranian student in ghent .
" the flemish are hard-working and they keep their land clean .
i have n't been to wallonia much , but do n't feel safe there . "
yakup uzun , a 27-year-old turk who has lived in both wallonia and flanders , says most foreigners in belgium " do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see " .
and many do n't like what they see .
ivorian-born charles yao konan , 34 - and who comes from another country divided between north and south - wonders why the two can not work out an agreement .
" developed countries are supposed to show a democratic example to developing countries - especially belgium , which is the capital of europe , " he says .

at the heart of the stalemate is the tension between dutch speakers and francophones .
in the fourth of a series of articles on belgium 's linguistic rift , henri astier considers how if affects immigrants .
ms biryukova says walloons know little about their flemish neighbours when natasha biryukova arrived in liege from moscow in 1995 , she was shocked to find out that her new homeland was not really belgium , but rather french-speaking wallonia .
" i came from the former ussr , and knew how people lived in uzbekistan thousands of miles away , " she says .
" but now , when i turn on my tv i only know what 's happening in wallonia . "
she said people there know nothing about the lives of their flemish neighbours just a few miles north .
ms biryukova is not alone .
immigrants settling in belgium end up on either side of a fault line that baffles many .
" foreigners did not study belgian history at school - whether they are in wallonia or flanders , for them , this is belgium , " says palestinian-born hamdan al damiri of cripel , an immigrant centre in liege .
we do n't want to take a position in the dispute between french and dutch speakers , but we often do n't have a choice naima charkaoui minderhedenforum " people are surprised that belgians squabble over language and other issues - especially in this globalised world . "
the divide is all the more awkward for newcomers as they get drawn into belgium 's particular brand of identity politics .
" we do n't want to take a position in the dispute between french and dutch speakers , but we often do n't have a choice , " says naima charkaoui of minderhedenforum , an umbrella group for immigrant associations in flanders .
" we are caught in the middle . "
tongue-tied language , a challenge for all exiles , is a particularly sensitive issue in flanders .
dutch is the single official language - although the rule is not evenly enforced .
when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it olivier somwa , accountant congolese-born , liege fatma pehlivan , ghent 's deputy mayor , used french , turkish , and arabic during her campaign , ignoring complaints .
" if i need chinese to communicate with people , i will use chinese , " she says .
still , in many municipalities dealings with officials are in dutch only .
and across flanders skilled workers must pass stringent language tests to have their qualifications recognised .
many feel the bar is set too high .
olivier somwa was an accountant in the democratic republic of congo when he arrived in antwerp in 1998 .
he spent two years learning dutch but failed the test , and had to become a farm worker .
" when you look for work at your level in flanders , you do n't get it , " says mr somwa , who eventually found an accounting job in liege .
the tough language requirements are not aimed at keeping immigrants out .
flanders ' booming economy needs foreign hands .
the region has a vibrant multicultural scene and subsidises all kinds of community groups .
the real reason for flemish linguistic punctiliousness lies not in xenophobia , but in the troubled history of belgium .
francophones used to run the country - and indeed its empire , which is why mr somwa of dr congo spoke french rather than dutch .
the defence of a long-suppressed language is pivotal to flemish identity .
" some politicians tell us : ' it 's french speakers we are targeting ' - but when people are not native dutch speakers , they are put in the same category as french speakers , " says ms charkaoui .
" the main victims are those in a vulnerable situation - immigrants who struggle to make a living and may find it difficult to attend language classes . "
trapped furthermore , those applying for social housing in flanders must prove that they either speak dutch or are enrolled in a course to learn it .
in some towns language conditions are even stricter .
some - especially older immigrants - find them discriminatory .
some companies in liege are now fully aware of the immigrant market tarik poyraz , a 17-year-old student from brussels , says learning another language is beyond his turkish parents , who are already struggling with french .
as a result , he says , his family is unable to escape the capital and its rising housing costs .
" we would like to move to -lsb- the northern suburb of -rsb- vilvoorde , where houses are cheaper , but we ca n't because they want us to speak dutch , " he says .
another peculiarity of flemish-style integration is the civic courses new immigrants have to take to learn the values of the host country .
" it was a waste of time , " says gezim bala , a 27-year-old albanian who studies medicine in ghent .
" i studied at school for 18 years and they were telling me to throw rubbish in the bin , not on the street . "
minderhedenforum 's naima charkaoui feels the courses should take the immigrants ' levels of education into account , but that they are on the whole a good thing .
however she objects to the rhetoric of sanctions that surrounds them .
" you can be fined thousands of euros if you skip lessons , " she says .
" there is no need for such threats . "
all dutch to them wallonia , by contrast , is relaxed about integrating foreigners , and has no mandatory courses .
by law -lsb- brussels officials -rsb- are supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune jaco van der merwe south african , brussels buoyed by an international language , walloons assume that new immigrants will fit in , just as earlier generations of southern and eastern european immigrants found a place in wallonia 's old industrial heartland .
but francophone casualness about language is precisely what some immigrants find problematic - notably in the officially bilingual but largely french-speaking capital .
jaco van der merwe , a south african who has been living in belgium for 10 years and has children there , is applying for citizenship .
he speaks only english and dutch and has a " big problem " with authorities in central brussels , where he lives .
" by law they 're supposed to either speak dutch or put you on to someone who does , but they do n't in my commune , " he says .
setting an example ultimately , immigrants are much more removed from the single entity that belgium remains than native on both sides are .
most foreigners do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see yakup uzun turkish-born , brussels even flemish nationalists have a keen sense of shared history with francophones - if just to dwell on past slights - and many speak perfect french .
but newcomers have no such awareness .
" in my two years here i 've met very few walloons , " says talha gokmen , 26 , who studies chemistry in ghent .
" wallonia for me is a different country - just like france . "
some do not see the point of keeping the country together , and reflect common prejudices about the other side .
" they should separate wallonia from flanders , " says one female iranian student in ghent .
" the flemish are hard-working and they keep their land clean .
i have n't been to wallonia much , but do n't feel safe there . "
yakup uzun , a 27-year-old turk who has lived in both wallonia and flanders , says most foreigners in belgium " do n't have an interest in having two different countries , but that 's what they see " .
and many do n't like what they see .
ivorian-born charles yao konan , 34 - and who comes from another country divided between north and south - wonders why the two can not work out an agreement .
" developed countries are supposed to show a democratic example to developing countries - especially belgium , which is the capital of europe , " he says .

invasives are a significant threat to a large proportion of the world 's biodiversity " graham madge , rspb an alien invasive species is a plant , animal or microorganism that is not native to an area , but has been introduced , either accidentally or deliberately , by humans .
all this week , bbc news will be taking a closer look at some of the alien invaders that are in the uk .
while the movement of species around the world is certainly not new , recent horror stories that highlight the damage that some invasive species can cause have made ecologists , politicians and industry sit up and take note .
predators could be superweed fix is there an alien in your garden ?
david roy , from the nerc centre for ecology and hydrology , has recently co-ordinated the delivering alien invasive species inventories for europe -lrb- daisie -rrb- project , which is the most comprehensive inventory of invasive species ever undertaken for europe .
he told bbc news that the number of invasive species had been chronically underestimated .
he said : " we 've identified almost 11,000 alien species in europe and the trend of new arrivals is showing no signs of levelling out . "
but while the majority of these are not troublesome , a significant proportion can cause problems .
dr roy explained : " we found that approximately 15 % of the aliens within europe are known to have some impact on the environment or economy - and this problem goes across all taxonomic groups . "

their impact on the uk economy has also been considerable ; the minister for biodiversity recently estimated that invasive species cost the british economy approximately £ 2bn a year .
programmes to control plants like the japanese knotweed or floating pennywort , which clogs up rivers causing potential flood risks , are time intensive and expensive .
and other species have proved costly to agriculture , forestry and aquaculture industries .
some invaders can even affect human health .
giant hogweed , which was introduced from asia but is now widespread across the uk , can cause painful blisters and burns if its sap comes into contact with skin .
oak processionary moth caterpillars can cause rashes or asthmatic attacks .
globalisation has been a key factor for the spread of alien invaders , says david roy .
he explained : " trade is the biggest source of movement of species - and new transport routes are being opened up all the time . "
strict control but is the uk doing enough to hold back this tide of alien invaders ?
ruth waters , who co-ordinates invasive species work for natural england , said : " places like australia and new zealand are really streets ahead of the uk in terms of understanding the issues , co-ordination and getting out there and doing something . "
but , she says , this is down to the fact that these countries have suffered economic and ecological damage from invaders on a much greater scale than the uk .
she added : " but the uk can really learn from what they have been doing . "
ecologists say that controlling invasive species is complicated by the fact that there are so many of them .
responsibility for dealing with them is also shared by many government and non-government bodies .
in may , the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- , the scottish government and the welsh assembly government launched a draft strategy for dealing with invasive species in great britain .
the northern ireland assembly and the republic of ireland government are also working on a joint strategic approach to the problem .
the aim is to find new methods to control existing species and faster and more co-ordinated ways of dealing with new species , as well as improving surveillance , monitoring and recording programmes .
while the governments ' new focus on invasive species has been broadly welcomed , conservationists are warning that swift action is necessary if the threat of invasives is to be contained .
graham madge , from the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , said : " government documents are long on rhetoric but very thin when it comes down to well-defined actions and accountable responsibility .

the south west 's only gender identity clinic , at newton abbot in devon , has seen a 77 % increase in referrals since last year .
there have been 50 new cases this year alone , and just under half of those referred end up having surgery .
clinic managers say that people are more aware of the issue and it is becoming more socially acceptable .
maria morris , manager of the gender and sexual medicine clinic , said : " because of clinics like ourselves , people are not as scared to come out and say : ' i need your help . " '
the clinic provides psychological support for people with gender identity disorders , from diagnosis through to transition and afterwards .
patients are referred to another region for gender reassignment surgery . "
out of our last 12 referrals we 've had seven female-to-males so its really bucked the trend " psychotherapist lynda quick as part of the sex change process , people must spend two years living as their chosen gender .
this means living in their new role at home , at work and socially .
the clinic is one of only three specialist units in the country .
the others are in london and sheffield but the devon unit , which is known as the laurels , has seen the biggest rise in referrals .
referrals at the charing cross clinic in london went up by 55 % last year , while sheffield 's went up by 59 % .
another trend is that the number of women asking for help at the devon clinic is far higher than the national average .
psychotherapist lynda quick said : " i have had a few female-to-male referrals who knew it was possible to go from male to female , but not that it was possible to go from female to male .
" so there is more awareness that this is possible .
out of our last 12 referrals we 've had seven female-to-males so its really bucked the trend . "
the clinic is currently working on a plan to develop its services , including provision for under 18s .
ms quick said : " we have had requests in the past for psychological support for under 18s and we 're just beginning to recognise that we actually need to be here for those people . "

the south west 's only gender identity clinic , at newton abbot in devon , has seen a 77 % increase in referrals since last year .
there have been 50 new cases this year alone , and just under half of those referred end up having surgery .
clinic managers say that people are more aware of the issue and it is becoming more socially acceptable .
maria morris , manager of the gender and sexual medicine clinic , said : " because of clinics like ourselves , people are not as scared to come out and say : ' i need your help . " '
the clinic provides psychological support for people with gender identity disorders , from diagnosis through to transition and afterwards .
patients are referred to another region for gender reassignment surgery .
out of our last 12 referrals we 've had seven female-to-males so its really bucked the trend psychotherapist lynda quick as part of the sex change process , people must spend two years living as their chosen gender .
this means living in their new role at home , at work and socially .
the clinic is one of only three specialist units in the country .
the others are in london and sheffield but the devon unit , which is known as the laurels , has seen the biggest rise in referrals .
referrals at the charing cross clinic in london went up by 55 % last year , while sheffield 's went up by 59 % .
another trend is that the number of women asking for help at the devon clinic is far higher than the national average .
psychotherapist lynda quick said : " i have had a few female-to-male referrals who knew it was possible to go from male to female , but not that it was possible to go from female to male .
" so there is more awareness that this is possible .
out of our last 12 referrals we 've had seven female-to-males so its really bucked the trend . "
the clinic is currently working on a plan to develop its services , including provision for under 18s .
ms quick said : " we have had requests in the past for psychological support for under 18s and we 're just beginning to recognise that we actually need to be here for those people . "

the overall aim of these measures is to support stability in the financial system ; to protect ordinary savers , depositors , businesses and borrowers ; and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer .
in summary , the measures intend to : provide sufficient liquidity in the short term ; make available new tier 1 capital to uk banks and building societies to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances , while maintaining their support for the real economy , through the recapitalisation scheme which has been made available to eligible institutions ; and ensure that the banking system has the funds necessary to maintain lending in the medium term through the credit guarantee scheme available to eligible institutions in relation to new short and medium term debt issuance .
the authorities have continued their detailed discussions with the institutions who confirmed their participation in the recapitalisation scheme last week .
these institutions committed in aggregate to increase their total tier 1 capital , either through their own actions or , where requested , through support from the government 's recapitalisation scheme in the form of preference and ordinary share capital .
the government is making capital investments to rbs , and upon successful merger , hbos and lloyds tsb , totaling £ 37 billion .
following the completion of these capital investments , each of the above institutions will have a tier 1 capital ratio in excess of 9 % , well above international minimum standards and at a level that should put them on a strong footing for the future .
all participating institutions are eligible to take advantage of the government 's credit guarantee scheme .
the debt management office is today announcing the general arrangements for operating the scheme .
further details relating to fees , the period under which guarantees will be issued and the application process can be found in the market notice which is being published by dmo at : www.dmo.gov.uk.
as part of its investment , the government has agreed with the banks supported by the recapitalisation scheme a range of commitments covering : maintaining , over the next three years , the availability and active marketing of competitively-priced lending to homeowners and to small businesses at 2007 levels ; support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes , and to support the expansion of financial capability initiatives ; remuneration of senior executives - both for 2008 -lrb- when the government expects no cash bonuses to be paid to board members -rrb- and for remuneration policy going forward -lrb- where incentive schemes will be reviewed and linked to long-term value creation , taking account of risk ; and restricting the potential for ' rewards for failure ' -rrb- ; the right for the government to agree with boards the appointment of new independent non-executive directors ; and dividend policy .
the recapitalisations are designed to enable participating banks to achieve prudent but efficient capital structures .
the government intends to create a new arms length body to manage the government 's shareholdings in recapitalised institutions on a professional and wholly commercial basis , and seek to effectively realise value to the taxpayer .
transparent arrangements will be put in place to ensure that any role for the government in relation to investment decision-making is clearly defined .
the government is not a permanent investor in uk banks .
its intention , over time , is to dispose of all the investments it is making as part of this scheme in an orderly way .
to reflect the implementation of the scheme , the government will tomorrow announce a revised debt remit for the debt management office .
further information is available at : www.dmo.gov.uk.
the measures the government is announcing today support stability in the wider financial system , and protect the interest of taxpayers , depositors and savers .
the government has informed the european commission of the schemes .
the government stands ready to provide support through the schemes to all eligible institutions , on the basis of the conditions set out in its announcement last week .
the government is continuing to collaborate internationally to stabilise and strengthen the global financial system , following the meetings of g7 and g20 finance ministers and the imf on friday and saturday .
other countries have announced measures to stabilise their own financial systems .
in parallel with other central banks , the bank of england is today announcing expanded swap lines with the us federal reserve and that the bank will supply dollar liquidity to the banking system against collateral at a pre-set price with no fixed limit on the amount .
the bank will continue to take all actions necessary to ensure that the banking system has access to sufficient liquidity .
with the first successful implementation of the schemes announced last week now completed , the government has taken decisive and extraordinary action to support the banking system during this period of exceptional financial turbulence , and to strengthen the system for the future as markets stabilise .

chancellor alistair darling outlined the rescue plan in the commons the overall aim of these measures is to support stability in the financial system ; to protect ordinary savers , depositors , businesses and borrowers ; and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer .
in summary , the measures intend to : provide sufficient liquidity in the short term ; make available new tier 1 capital to uk banks and building societies to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances , while maintaining their support for the real economy , through the recapitalisation scheme which has been made available to eligible institutions ; and ensure that the banking system has the funds necessary to maintain lending in the medium term through the credit guarantee scheme available to eligible institutions in relation to new short and medium term debt issuance .
the authorities have continued their detailed discussions with the institutions who confirmed their participation in the recapitalisation scheme last week .
these institutions committed in aggregate to increase their total tier 1 capital , either through their own actions or , where requested , through support from the government 's recapitalisation scheme in the form of preference and ordinary share capital .
the government is making capital investments to rbs , and upon successful merger , hbos and lloyds tsb , totaling £ 37 billion .
following the completion of these capital investments , each of the above institutions will have a tier 1 capital ratio in excess of 9 % , well above international minimum standards and at a level that should put them on a strong footing for the future .
all participating institutions are eligible to take advantage of the government 's credit guarantee scheme .
the debt management office is today announcing the general arrangements for operating the scheme .
further details relating to fees , the period under which guarantees will be issued and the application process can be found in the market notice which is being published by dmo at : www.dmo.gov.uk.
as part of its investment , the government has agreed with the banks supported by the recapitalisation scheme a range of commitments covering : maintaining , over the next three years , the availability and active marketing of competitively-priced lending to homeowners and to small businesses at 2007 levels ; support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes , and to support the expansion of financial capability initiatives ; remuneration of senior executives - both for 2008 -lrb- when the government expects no cash bonuses to be paid to board members -rrb- and for remuneration policy going forward -lrb- where incentive schemes will be reviewed and linked to long-term value creation , taking account of risk ; and restricting the potential for ' rewards for failure ' -rrb- ; the right for the government to agree with boards the appointment of new independent non-executive directors ; and dividend policy .
the recapitalisations are designed to enable participating banks to achieve prudent but efficient capital structures .
the government intends to create a new arms length body to manage the government 's shareholdings in recapitalised institutions on a professional and wholly commercial basis , and seek to effectively realise value to the taxpayer .
transparent arrangements will be put in place to ensure that any role for the government in relation to investment decision-making is clearly defined .
the government is not a permanent investor in uk banks .
its intention , over time , is to dispose of all the investments it is making as part of this scheme in an orderly way .
to reflect the implementation of the scheme , the government will tomorrow announce a revised debt remit for the debt management office .
further information is available at : www.dmo.gov.uk.
the measures the government is announcing today support stability in the wider financial system , and protect the interest of taxpayers , depositors and savers .
the government has informed the european commission of the schemes .
the government stands ready to provide support through the schemes to all eligible institutions , on the basis of the conditions set out in its announcement last week .
the government is continuing to collaborate internationally to stabilise and strengthen the global financial system , following the meetings of g7 and g20 finance ministers and the imf on friday and saturday .
other countries have announced measures to stabilise their own financial systems .
in parallel with other central banks , the bank of england is today announcing expanded swap lines with the us federal reserve and that the bank will supply dollar liquidity to the banking system against collateral at a pre-set price with no fixed limit on the amount .
the bank will continue to take all actions necessary to ensure that the banking system has access to sufficient liquidity .
with the first successful implementation of the schemes announced last week now completed , the government has taken decisive and extraordinary action to support the banking system during this period of exceptional financial turbulence , and to strengthen the system for the future as markets stabilise .

tom was just 14 when he died suddenly and completely unexpectedly from an undiagnosed heart condition .
he was a bright , funny , active , and seemingly healthy teenager - the kind of boy everyone liked .
in the uk , 12 young people die from an undiagnosed heart condition every week .
they are people who inherited a structural abnormality or an electrical fault of the heart .
this new figure has been collated by the charity cry - cardiac risk in the young - and denotes deaths among people up to the age of 35 .
it is based on data from the office of national statistics for 2005 , and represents an increase of 50 % on the previous estimate of eight deaths a week .
dr sanjay sharma , a consultant cardiologist at king 's college hospital in london , is in charge of cry 's heart screening programme and analysed the figures . "
the death of a child is just too huge for most people to comprehend " claire prosser , tom 's mother ' life without my noisy boy ' listen via the bbc iplayer he said : " maybe 12 a week does n't seem very many when you consider the thousands dying from heart attacks or heart failure in the uk every year .
" but what horrified me , was the age of these people - a lot of them were under eighteen . "
cry runs a national cardiac screening programme for anyone who may be at risk .
' awareness must be raised ' some people - like tom - have no symptoms before they die .
but many youngsters do get warning signs .
chest pains or undue breathlessness when exercising , heart palpitations , bouts of dizziness or blackouts - all of these may indicate a heart defect .
and because these conditions are genetic , dr sharma believes there are other people who should consider heart screening too .
these would include anyone who has a close relative - a parent , sibling or child - with a potentially hereditary heart condition , and anyone who has a close relative who died suddenly under the age of forty .
it is quite likely sudden death may indicate an undiagnosed heart problem .
" we have to raise awareness about this in the general population " , says dr sharma .
" most importantly we have to get the message out to gps - they are the ones on the front line . "
exercise clue dr sharma sees over 30 patients a week in his clinics at both king 's college hospital and university hospital in lewisham .
all of them are under 35 .
treatment will vary according to how serious the condition is .
he says : " we can now identify those at high risk , and we supply those patients with defibrillators .
" some people will be treatable with drugs .
for others it may just be a question of lifestyle modification .
" for instance , someone might get minor symptoms but only when they exercise .
if we can persuade them not to exercise so vigorously , that may be all that 's needed . "
since they lost tom , his family have campaigned to raise awareness about heart defects in young people .
" the death of a child is just too huge for most people to comprehend " , says tom 's mum , claire prosser .
" when tom died , cry understood what we were going through .
" if we can prevent even one family from going through what we have , it will be worthwhile . "
' life after tom ' will be broadcast on monday 13th october on bbc radio 4 .
it tells the story of tom 's mum , claire prosser , as she begins to rebuild her life without her son .

the death of a child is just too huge for most people to comprehend claire prosser , tom 's mother ' life without my noisy boy ' listen via the bbc iplayer he said : " maybe 12 a week does n't seem very many when you consider the thousands dying from heart attacks or heart failure in the uk every year .
" but what horrified me , was the age of these people - a lot of them were under eighteen . "
cry runs a national cardiac screening programme for anyone who may be at risk .
' awareness must be raised ' some people - like tom - have no symptoms before they die .
but many youngsters do get warning signs .
chest pains or undue breathlessness when exercising , heart palpitations , bouts of dizziness or blackouts - all of these may indicate a heart defect .

claire prosser talks about tom and because these conditions are genetic , dr sharma believes there are other people who should consider heart screening too .
these would include anyone who has a close relative - a parent , sibling or child - with a potentially hereditary heart condition , and anyone who has a close relative who died suddenly under the age of forty .
it is quite likely sudden death may indicate an undiagnosed heart problem .
" we have to raise awareness about this in the general population " , says dr sharma .
" most importantly we have to get the message out to gps - they are the ones on the front line . "
exercise clue dr sharma sees over 30 patients a week in his clinics at both king 's college hospital and university hospital in lewisham .
all of them are under 35 .
treatment will vary according to how serious the condition is .
dr sanjay sharma says he was ' horrified ' by the age of those affected he says : " we can now identify those at high risk , and we supply those patients with defibrillators .
" some people will be treatable with drugs .
for others it may just be a question of lifestyle modification .
" for instance , someone might get minor symptoms but only when they exercise .
if we can persuade them not to exercise so vigorously , that may be all that 's needed . "
since they lost tom , his family have campaigned to raise awareness about heart defects in young people .
" the death of a child is just too huge for most people to comprehend " , says tom 's mum , claire prosser .
" when tom died , cry understood what we were going through .
" if we can prevent even one family from going through what we have , it will be worthwhile . "
' life after tom ' will be broadcast on monday 13th october on bbc radio 4 .
it tells the story of tom 's mum , claire prosser , as she begins to rebuild her life without her son .
you can listen again via the bbc iplayer .

hbos shareholders will now get 0.605 lloyds shares for every hbos share , against the original offer of 0.833 .
it follows the news that the two banks will get a combined £ 17bn of taxpayers ' cash to bolster their finances .
hbos said the injection of capital meant the government could end up with 43.5 % of the combined group .
banking giant under the government 's plan to stabilise the banking system , hbos is set to get £ 11.5bn of government cash and lloyds £ 5.5bn when the merger is successfully completed .
when the deal is concluded , hbos 's chairman lord dennis stevenson and chief executive andy hornby will both stand down .
first announced on 17 september , lloyds tsb 's takeover of hbos will create a banking giant holding close to one-third of the uk 's savings and mortgage market .
hbos , which was formed by the merger of the halifax and bank of scotland , is the uk 's largest mortgage lender with a 20 % market share .
the government said its investments in lloyds tsb / hbos and rbs are not permanent , and that it intends to sell its shares when the market recovers .
