she has been frequently visiting this country but this time her visit had a special significance .
she arrived on the third of this month as the united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief to make an assessment of the indian situation .
without mincing words , she articulated her fears that religious intolerance in india was on the rise .
addressing a press conference on thursday at the united nations headquarters in new delhi , asma jahangir said , “ in the last decade , i am told by everyone that i have met in india , religious intolerance has risen , and the concepts of secularism are dwindling . ”
during her visit , asma jahangir met ministers of external affairs , minority affairs and culture as well as chief ministers of delhi , jammu and kashmir , gujarat , kerala and orissa .
she also had discussions with the solicitor general of india , several supreme court and high court judges , leaders of religious communities , journalists , academics and members of civil society organisations .
anti-minority bias her meetings with jammu and kashmir chief minister ghulam nabi azad , gujarat chief minister narendra modi and orissa chief minister naveen patnaik were of special interest as these states have witnessed anti-hindu , anti-muslim and anti-christian violence respectively .
while paying rich tributes to indian secularism , jahangir noticed that the state ’ s law-enforcing agencies often displayed anti-minority biases .
she said while indians by and large respected religious diversity , groups organised on the basis of religious identity unleashed fears of mob violence .
the human rights leader expressed concern at the extended timeframe of investigations in cases involving communal riots , violence and massacres such as those that occurred in 1984 in delhi , 1992 in mumbai and 2002 in gujarat .
kashmir assessment asma jahangir said she was deeply touched to hear of the exodus of the kashmiri pandits from jammu and kashmir following a campaign of threats and violence .
hindus are a minority in the state and their exodus coincided with the rise of militancy in the kashmir valley .
she said while muslims in srinagar were realising their mistake , she did not see such a phenomenon in gujarat : “ there is remorse , i think , much more that i saw amongst people in srinagar but i did not detect remorse within those sections in gujarat that do matter . ”
jahangir also noticed that while the state did not take sides in kashmir , it did in gujarat .
“ the complicity of the state was not there in the kashmiri pandits ' case but it appears to be in the case of gujarat . ”
asma jahangir said the vast majority of indians respect secular traditions and she had noticed encouraging signs in the fight against religious intolerance .
she said she was impressed by the “ outstanding degree of human rights activism in india . ”
she hopes to present her full report to the united nations in three months . kuldeep kumar -lrb- du -rrb- 20/03/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic kuldeep kumar reports on the outcome of jahangir ’ s visit 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .

the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .

"
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 20.03.2008 doping widespread at team telekom , report suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team telekom , seen here in 2004 , is accused of illegal doping over a 13-year period the telekom cycling team and its now defunct successor t-mobile were " probably " involved in systematic doping for over a decade , a university clinic freiburg external investigation commission claimed thursday , march 20 . three experts - lawyer hans-joachim schaefer , biomechanics expert wilhelm schaenzer and pharmacologist ulrich schwabe - produced their findings after nearly a year of work .
" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .
former telekom riders rolf aldag , erik zabel , bert dietz , joerg jak , christian henn and sinkewitz were all questioned by the inquiry . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .
" the bank is dead and as i mention on each and any occasion , it has seen further problems ; the bank is not worth a dime , " he said in an interview with afp news agency .
a second trader added that only the very brave were investing in ikb at the moment and that he would recommend others to stay well clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .
" this is where the eu should see whether it can raise the pressure if the situation in tibet does n't improve . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .
" the bank is dead and as i mention on each and any occasion , it has seen further problems ; the bank is not worth a dime , " he said in an interview with afp news agency .
a second trader added that only the very brave were investing in ikb at the moment and that he would recommend others to stay well clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : independence demonstrations turn violent in tibet olympic torch starts journey to beijing , despite disruptions germany calls on china to open up on tibet expert believes west can do little to sway china over tibet china expels last foreign journalists from tibet human rights -pipe- 20.03.2008 germany suspends aid talks with china over tibet violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetans rallied in switzerland this week to call an end to killings in a fresh blow to berlin-beijing relations , germany has said it is freezing aid talks with the chinese government as a result of china 's crackdown on demonstrations in tibet . germany said it was suspending intergovernmental aid talks with china if the country did not end a bloody clampdown on tibetan protestors , raising the stakes in a highly charged international conundrum over how to deal with beijing 's rights violations months before the city hosts the olympic games .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .
" this is where the eu should see whether it can raise the pressure if the situation in tibet does n't improve . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.03.2008 us subprime tremors continue to rock germany 's ikb bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis continues to have knock-on effects around the world with fears of another downturn in the us economy gripping european financial markets and institutions , the continued knock-on effects of last year 's subprime mortgage crisis are still being felt by germany 's ikb bank . the ikb industrie bank , one of many hit by the us crisis , announced thursday , march 20 , that it had failed to recover from the effects on its investments in the united states and that its future reported losses would be greater than previously anticipated .
as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .
" the bank is dead and as i mention on each and any occasion , it has seen further problems ; the bank is not worth a dime , " he said in an interview with afp news agency .
a second trader added that only the very brave were investing in ikb at the moment and that he would recommend others to stay well clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .
former telekom riders rolf aldag , erik zabel , bert dietz , joerg jak , christian henn and sinkewitz were all questioned by the inquiry . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .

ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .

the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .
former telekom riders rolf aldag , erik zabel , bert dietz , joerg jak , christian henn and sinkewitz were all questioned by the inquiry . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she has been frequently visiting this country but this time her visit had a special significance .
she arrived on the third of this month as the united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief to make an assessment of the indian situation .
without mincing words , she articulated her fears that religious intolerance in india was on the rise .
addressing a press conference on thursday at the united nations headquarters in new delhi , asma jahangir said , “ in the last decade , i am told by everyone that i have met in india , religious intolerance has risen , and the concepts of secularism are dwindling . ”
during her visit , asma jahangir met ministers of external affairs , minority affairs and culture as well as chief ministers of delhi , jammu and kashmir , gujarat , kerala and orissa .
she also had discussions with the solicitor general of india , several supreme court and high court judges , leaders of religious communities , journalists , academics and members of civil society organisations .
anti-minority bias her meetings with jammu and kashmir chief minister ghulam nabi azad , gujarat chief minister narendra modi and orissa chief minister naveen patnaik were of special interest as these states have witnessed anti-hindu , anti-muslim and anti-christian violence respectively .
while paying rich tributes to indian secularism , jahangir noticed that the state ’ s law-enforcing agencies often displayed anti-minority biases .
she said while indians by and large respected religious diversity , groups organised on the basis of religious identity unleashed fears of mob violence .
the human rights leader expressed concern at the extended timeframe of investigations in cases involving communal riots , violence and massacres such as those that occurred in 1984 in delhi , 1992 in mumbai and 2002 in gujarat .
kashmir assessment asma jahangir said she was deeply touched to hear of the exodus of the kashmiri pandits from jammu and kashmir following a campaign of threats and violence .
hindus are a minority in the state and their exodus coincided with the rise of militancy in the kashmir valley .
she said while muslims in srinagar were realising their mistake , she did not see such a phenomenon in gujarat : “ there is remorse , i think , much more that i saw amongst people in srinagar but i did not detect remorse within those sections in gujarat that do matter . ”
jahangir also noticed that while the state did not take sides in kashmir , it did in gujarat .
“ the complicity of the state was not there in the kashmiri pandits ' case but it appears to be in the case of gujarat . ”
asma jahangir said the vast majority of indians respect secular traditions and she had noticed encouraging signs in the fight against religious intolerance .
she said she was impressed by the “ outstanding degree of human rights activism in india . ”
she hopes to present her full report to the united nations in three months . kuldeep kumar -lrb- du -rrb- 20/03/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic kuldeep kumar reports on the outcome of jahangir ’ s visit 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .

bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .
the german journalists federation -lrb- djv -rrb- referred to a glaring violation of press freedoms .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .

" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .
the german journalists federation -lrb- djv -rrb- referred to a glaring violation of press freedoms .

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .
1 , 2001 . his last message to europe came in november of last year , when he admonished europeans for partnering with the us in afghanistan and demanded their withdrawal . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.03.2008 us subprime tremors continue to rock germany 's ikb bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us subprime crisis continues to have knock-on effects around the world with fears of another downturn in the us economy gripping european financial markets and institutions , the continued knock-on effects of last year 's subprime mortgage crisis are still being felt by germany 's ikb bank . the ikb industrie bank , one of many hit by the us crisis , announced thursday , march 20 , that it had failed to recover from the effects on its investments in the united states and that its future reported losses would be greater than previously anticipated .
as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .
" the bank is dead and as i mention on each and any occasion , it has seen further problems ; the bank is not worth a dime , " he said in an interview with afp news agency .
a second trader added that only the very brave were investing in ikb at the moment and that he would recommend others to stay well clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .
" this is where the eu should see whether it can raise the pressure if the situation in tibet does n't improve . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .
" this is where the eu should see whether it can raise the pressure if the situation in tibet does n't improve . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .
the german journalists federation -lrb- djv -rrb- referred to a glaring violation of press freedoms .

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .

" the internet is already full of commentaries by right-wing catholics saying , ' wonderful , now we finally have the green light to proselytize . '
a message like this serves to stimulate anti-semitic circles , " he told the online site of the newsweekly der spiegel . " the church does not have its anti-semitic tendencies under control . " homolka has joined some 1,600 other rabbis around the world in formally protesting against the prayer .
but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .
1 , 2001 . his last message to europe came in november of last year , when he admonished europeans for partnering with the us in afghanistan and demanded their withdrawal . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .

it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .

the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 20.03.2008 doping widespread at team telekom , report suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team telekom , seen here in 2004 , is accused of illegal doping over a 13-year period the telekom cycling team and its now defunct successor t-mobile were " probably " involved in systematic doping for over a decade , a university clinic freiburg external investigation commission claimed thursday , march 20 . three experts - lawyer hans-joachim schaefer , biomechanics expert wilhelm schaenzer and pharmacologist ulrich schwabe - produced their findings after nearly a year of work .
" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .
former telekom riders rolf aldag , erik zabel , bert dietz , joerg jak , christian henn and sinkewitz were all questioned by the inquiry . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .
20 .
ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .
contravening olympic agreements ?
the human rights organization reporters without borders criticized beijing 's actions .
the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suppression of the protests in tibet sparked worldwide demonstrations spokeswoman katrin evers said it was apparent that the chinese authorities did not want anyone from outside to witness what was going on in tibet . she accused china of once again breaking its promise to allow foreign journalists more freedom of movement ahead of the olympic games .

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .
1 , 2001 . his last message to europe came in november of last year , when he admonished europeans for partnering with the us in afghanistan and demanded their withdrawal . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .
" the bank is dead and as i mention on each and any occasion , it has seen further problems ; the bank is not worth a dime , " he said in an interview with afp news agency .
a second trader added that only the very brave were investing in ikb at the moment and that he would recommend others to stay well clear . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .
former telekom riders rolf aldag , erik zabel , bert dietz , joerg jak , christian henn and sinkewitz were all questioned by the inquiry . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .
1 , 2001 . his last message to europe came in november of last year , when he admonished europeans for partnering with the us in afghanistan and demanded their withdrawal . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .
1 , 2001 . his last message to europe came in november of last year , when he admonished europeans for partnering with the us in afghanistan and demanded their withdrawal . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .
" this is where the eu should see whether it can raise the pressure if the situation in tibet does n't improve . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes amidst reports of china beefing up its security presence in and around the area . beijing had threatened to withdraw the residence permits of the two german journalists if they failed to comply with the demand .
the move has been widely condemned by journalists ' organizations and human rights groups .
georg blume , a correspondent for the german weekly die zeit , and kristin kupfer , a reporter for the austrian weekly profil and the german news service epd , left the tibetan capital lhasa on thursday , mar .

ramping up military presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg blume was one of the last foreign reporters still in lhasa , the tibetan capital blume reported seeing large military convoys moving near lhasa shortly before his departure .
" one convoy was about two kilometers long and contained about 200 trucks , each having 30 soldiers on board .
so that 's about 6,000 military personnel in one convoy , " he told the afp news agency .
a separate source , who asked not to be identified , told afp : " lots of security forces are on the streets .
we can see chinese security going door to door .
it 's very tense . "
the expulsion of foreign journalists from tibet is at odds with beijing 's pledge in january to allow foreign reporters more freedom ahead of the olympic games , which open in five months .
after the outbreak of protests in tibet last friday , the chinese leadership prohibited foreign journalists travelling to or remaining in the province , citing reasons of safety .
at the same time , it criticized the western media for biased reporting of the events there .

the group said it knew of over 40 cases in which journalists ' work had been impeded by security forces , who had tried to stop filming , confiscate photographs and cordon off streets .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .

more than 50,000 european homes and offices acquired a high-speed connection every day in 2007 . in addition to the increase in broadband usage , ever more people are also using the internet when they 're out and about , according to the european commission .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the very young are getting into the act the commission attributed the increase in broadband access , in part , to the increase in competition in the telecommunications market , which has cut prices to new lows .

but with a total broadband penetration rate of 20 percent , the 27-member eu , as a whole , lags behind other major industrialized regions .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .
" china 's economy is dependent on the transfer of technology , " volker beck , a green party leader , told daily berliner zeitung .
" this is where the eu should see whether it can raise the pressure if the situation in tibet does n't improve . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .
" the bank is dead and as i mention on each and any occasion , it has seen further problems ; the bank is not worth a dime , " he said in an interview with afp news agency .

but he said their calls have fallen on deaf ears at the vatican . " it is very rare for a pope , for an infallible person , to renounce a decision because he had a bad day , " he said in an interview . reappearance among traditionalists for centuries until the liturgical reforms of the second vatican council in the 1960s , catholics prayed for the conversion of jews on good friday , the day that commemorates christ 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayer issue has strained jewish-catholic relations the prayer was abandoned along with the latin mass , but has reappeared in a modified form since pope benedict xvi , a native of germany , last year authorized traditionalist catholics to use the so-called tridentine mass under strict conditions . the old prayer calls on god to " remove the veil from their hearts " of the jews and to end " the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth , which is christ , they may be delivered from their darkness . " a new version published last month removes any reference to the veil or the allusion to blindness but does retain the call for conversion , asking god to " illuminate their hearts , that -lrb- they -rrb- acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . " more sensitivity the vice president of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn , told the daily frankfurter rundschau that jews expected more sensitivity from a german pope due to the country 's nazi past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn " this is a return to times we thought we had overcome , " korn said , referring to the period two decades ago , before the catholic church apologized for its passivity and even complicity during the holocaust . cardinal walter kasper of germany defended the pope 's decision not to change the prayer on theological grounds . " christians must of course bear witness with their ' older brothers and sisters in the faith of abraham ' -lrb- john paul ii -rrb- to their faith and to the wealth and beauty of their belief in jesus christ where it is appropriate , " he wrote in a guest column for the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . but he said this did not mean that the vatican was encouraging proselytizing among jews or failed to respect their faith . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .

researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .

the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .

" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .

these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .

" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said on wednesday , march 19 , that her ministry would suspend negotiations with the chinese government which mainly involve grants to reduce air pollution by chinese power plants .
" violence can never be a solution , " wieczorek-zeul said .
" the two sides can only arrive at a solution through dialogue .
under such conditions , it is hardly conceivable to be conducting intergovernmental negotiations , " she said .
fresh blow the move marks a fresh upset in berlin-beijing relations , which had only recently been patched up after chinese anger at chancellor angela merkel receiving the dalai lama in her office in september last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul says talks will be suspended until the violence ends government level talks between berlin and beijing , scheduled to start in may , would not begin until the violence has stopped , wieczorek-zeul said .
the minister last year oversaw talks last year that led to total grants of 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- , her aides said .
these were mainly paid out to chinese companies operating dirty electricity plants .
berlin said it offered the help because china had the world 's second-largest emissions of carbon dioxide and was the world 's worst sulphur-dioxide polluter .
wieczorek-zeul said separate talks going back several years between germany and china on improving the rule of law would continue .
the chinese crackdown in tibet and nearby provinces , following riots that may have killed dozens of people , have sparked calls for a boycott of the august beijing games that china wants to turn into a celebration of its emergence as a world power .
" unspeakable language " beijing has blamed tibet 's exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama , for the monk-led protests and rioting - the most serious in the himalayan region for nearly two decades - to try to wreck the aug .
8-24 games .
the dalai lama insists he only wants greater autonomy for his homeland , not independence from china .
his government-in-exile says 99 people died when chinese security forces moved to quell the riot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama , seen here with chancellor merkel , is well respected in western capitals on wednesday , china stepped up its criticism of the dalai lama with tibet 's communist party secretary , zhang qingli , telling a teleconference of regional officials : " we are engaged in a fierce battle of blood and fire with the dalai clique , a life-and-death struggle between the foe and us . "
the harsh rhetoric has raised hackles in the west where the tibetan spiritual leader is usually welcomed by governments .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenther nooke said it had to be made clear to the chinese government that it had no chance of getting away with such words .
" the language used by the chinese government is unspeakable , " nooke said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" the vocabulary of the chinese cultural revolution is being used here again .
that scares me .
we should n't allow a country like china to get away with it . "
in rome , pope benedict broke his silence on tibet on wednesday , calling for dialog to end " suffering " there . " violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them , " he said at the end of his weekly general audience , adding that he was following events in tibet " with trepidation . "
in a move almost certain to irritate beijing , british prime minister gordon brown said he would meet the dalai lama during a visit to britain expected in may .
calls for economic pressure amid heated debates in europe about whether to boycott the opening ceremony of the olympic games in august to register protest against china 's stance in tibet , the european union has been urged to send a mission to beijing to demand an explanation to the tibet crisis .
germany 's opposition green party also want the eu to raise economic pressure on china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 20.03.2008 doping widespread at team telekom , report suggests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team telekom , seen here in 2004 , is accused of illegal doping over a 13-year period the telekom cycling team and its now defunct successor t-mobile were " probably " involved in systematic doping for over a decade , a university clinic freiburg external investigation commission claimed thursday , march 20 . three experts - lawyer hans-joachim schaefer , biomechanics expert wilhelm schaenzer and pharmacologist ulrich schwabe - produced their findings after nearly a year of work .
" having taken into account the information available to date , it appears conclusive to the commission that from 1993 until 2006 cyclists with team telekom and t-mobile were doped by doctors attached to the sport medicine department , " the commission said in a statement on the university 's website .
" even if there have been no admissions from cyclists during the period between 2001 and 2005 , the commission believes it is probable there were doping operations during this time , " said the report .
" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .
prosecutors in the federal state of baden-wuerttemberg where freiburg is located confirmed thursday that charges had been laid against schmid and heinrich with the freiburg labor court .
more doctors named in doping report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the doctors may have administered the blood booster epo the two doctors are accused of carrying out tasks different to those which they were contracted and paid to do .
the pair admitted last may that they had helped individual professional cyclists to dope .
the commission has also revealed two other doctors , in addition to heinrich and schmid , are also heavily suspected of doping operations and both are no longer employed by the clinic .
" andreas blum and stefan vogt also received payments for doping practices , " said the report .
" it is frightening that physicians worked with criminal energy and made lots of money .
that is unethical , " the clinic 's chairman , matthias brandis , told german agency sid .
researchers promise further revelations " this is only the beginning , " said hans-joachim schaefer .
" there are other details which we want to shed light on .
i have some sympathy for the cyclists .
they had to integrate themselves in a team where there were perfect examples of doping going on . "
the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- has already asked for more information and is likely to take action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz had his ban reduced by cooperating the report sheds light on the doping practices of team t-mobile - which changed its name from team telekom in 2004 only for german telecommunications firm deutsche telekom to withdraw their sponsorship at the end of last year .
the team is now called high road and is based in the us .
earlier this month , german t-mobile cyclist patrick sinkewitz implicated other as yet unnamed riders in an ongoing doping probe by german authorities .
sinkewitz was caught for testosterone abuse last year , but only received a one-year ban as a he agreed to be act as a witness .
former telekom riders rolf aldag , erik zabel , bert dietz , joerg jak , christian henn and sinkewitz were all questioned by the inquiry . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is not only the evidence of payments received by the doctors from the cyclist team , but also paperwork for fictitious patients . "
two t-mobile doctors from the freiburg clinic , andreas schmid and lothar heinrich , were sacked last year over their involvement in the distribution of illegal substances and methods and several riders also admitted to substance abuse in the 1990s , including 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis .

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .

it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .

as a result of the announcement , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future .
trading was suspended after the shares had fallen 2.6 percent to 4.93 euros following a press report which said the company had been forced to suspend an auction of risky assets .
the business daily handelsblatt had said earlier in the day that an auction of most of ikb 's three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.7 billion -rrb- portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids , which might lead to further write-downs at ikb .
the dusseldorf-based bank later confirmed it had been forced to write down the value of more of its assets .
huge losses despite government bail-out ikb , which primarily offers long-term financing to small- and medium-sized german companies , said losses would total 800 million euros over the financial year to march 2008 , up from a maximum of 700 million euros previously made public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is gray for the ikb bank last month , the german government - which owns a 38-percent stake through the kfw , a state-owned bank set up after world war ii to help fund reconstruction - stepped in to prop up the ailing ikb , putting up one billion euros of a 1.5-billion-euro rescue package to prevent the crisis spreading to the rest of the country 's banking sector .
it also included a 450-million-euro buffer for further write-downs , an amount which may now prove insufficient , handelsblatt said in its report .
the kfw twice plugged the gaps at ikb last year and was expected to do so again following the announcement of further losses . one frankfurt trader said he had totally written off ikb .

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intelligence officials said there was no indication when a possible attack might occur . bin laden 's audio message , heard over a video image of him holding an ak-47 automatic rifle , coincided with the fifth anniversary of the start of the iraq war .
it was posted on al qaeda 's web site on wednesday , march 19 , which is also the day observed in the muslim world as mohammed 's birthday . the militant leader said publishing the controversial caricatures of the muslim prophet was a greater offense than the " bombing of modest villages that collapsed over our women and children , " in a reference to the invasion of iraq by us and european forces . al qaeda may be planning attack on europe " the punishment will also be more severe , " he said , addressing the " intelligent ones " in the european union : " do n't listen to our words , watch our actions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden has sent dozens of recorded messages to the west since 9/11 intelcenter , a us-based terrorism monitoring group , said the message was " a clear threat against eu member countries and an indicator of a possible upcoming significant attack , however , it is unclear in exactly what timeframe it may occur . " sajjan gohel of the asia-pacific foundation , a london-based security think tank , said the message does n't necessarily mean europe will raise their threat levels . " the reason they would do this is based on intelligence , " he said as reported by reuters .
he also conceded that the terrorist leader has a strong influence on his followers . " when osama bin laden talks , people listen - his supporters and constituents throughout the world are motivated by his words and want to turn them into action , " added gohel .
" europe has become the battleground for al qaeda . " pope addressed in audio message bin laden specifically mentioned pope benedict xvi in the five-minute message , saying he played a " significant role " in the publication of the mohammed cartoons , which he considered to be part of a " new crusade " against muslims . the pontiff is scheduled to visit new york city next month , where he is to speak at the un , pray at the world trade center site and celebrate mass in yankee stadium .
the new york police department said after the publication of the message that it was working closely with the secret service to up security standards for the pope during his stay . drawings enraged muslim world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish papers republished the drawings out of solidarity with the cartoonist a series of mohammed caricatures , including one picturing the muslim prophet with a turban resembling a bomb , were originally published in danish newspapers in 2006 when they sparked violent riots throughout the muslim world . seventeen danish dailies republished the cartoons on feb .
13 after police foiled a plot to murder one of the cartoonists .
bin laden 's new message is likely to cause particular concern in denmark , where the controversial drawings originated . bin laden , who has confessed to organizing the 9/11 terror attack on the united states , has a $ 25-million bounty on his head .
he has been at large since sept .
1 , 2001 . his last message to europe came in november of last year , when he admonished europeans for partnering with the us in afghanistan and demanded their withdrawal . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a world of instant gratification , the traditional approach to prostitution seems archaic to some .
the changing times are not welcomed by all . could it be that the world 's oldest profession has had its day ?
has the glow from the famous red light finally faded ?
according to hamburg brothel owner waltraud mehrer , prostitution just ai n't what it used to be which is why she is closing down the port city 's oldest pleasure palace .
" it 's time to go , " mehrer told reuters .
" it 's a pity , but business just is n't what it used to be .
we used to have 10 girls working here .
now we only have four . "
mehrer blames the incursion of more respectable establishments for the decline in business of the hotel luxor , which was opened on the world famous reeperbahn in 1948 by mehrer 's father-in-law .
the rehabilitation and regeneration of the notorious st. pauli district means that more discos and nightclubs are opening at the expense of strip bars and fleshpots .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun seekers , not sex seekers , are the majority on the reeperbahn today " for every shop around here which closes , a disco comes and opens , " mehrer said with regret .
the widespread introduction of close circuit television -lrb- cctv -rrb- cameras and police patrols in the area have also deterred would-be punters , contributing to the sharp fall in business which mehrer cites as one of her reasons for closing .
internet and age are business killers mehrer also blamed internet pornography and the rise of the credit card for the decline in business , explaining that most women preferred to be paid in cash .
the luxor , the only family-run brothel on the reeperbahn , had its heyday in the late 1960s when the booming hamburg harbor provided a steady stream of customers .
but the commercialization of the port and the city 's changing image means that shore leave no longer means a night of stiff drinks and a transaction with a lady of the evening .
" sailors used to come here often but now the regulars are dying out , " one of the working girls told reporters .
quality of service goes down , so to speak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clients may not be looking for love but at least good service the suspicion that some of the girls coming to work in hamburg 's brothels may have been the victims of kidnap and human traffickers may not put too many of the lusty punters off their stride but the people who own the establishments have been put on guard , another changing aspect of the game .
mehrer believes these girls are contributing to the slow decline of service quality and the consequent dissatisfaction and disillusion of clients .
" sure those girls are pretty , but some of them are just nineteen , " she said .
" they 're mainly foreign women , eastern europeans , and do n't care about the satisfaction of their customers like we do . "
despite her initial sadness at having to shut the luxor , waltraud mehrer is resigned to its fate and looks back with warm memories .
" we 've had some great times , " she said .
" but times are changing .
things here just are n't the same any more .
now we 've got to come to terms with that . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

researchers found high dietary folate was linked to lower levels of sperm with the wrong number of chromosomes .
folate , also protective against birth defects , is found in leafy green vegetables , fruit and pulses .
the study , by the university of california , berkeley , features in the journal human reproduction .
this study is the first to suggest that paternal diet may play a role after conception in the development of healthy offspring professor brenda eskenazi university of california , berkeley it is estimated that up to 4 % of sperm in a healthy man carry either too many or too few chromosomes - a condition known as aneuploidy .
aneuploidy is linked to failure to conceive , miscarriages , and children born with conditions such as down 's syndrome , turner 's syndrome and klinefelter 's syndrome .
however , the reason why sperm become mutated in this way is poorly understood .
the berkeley team analysed sperm samples from 89 healthy , non-smoking men , and quizzed them about their intake of zinc , folate , vitamin c , vitamin e and beta carotene .
folate either came from the men 's diet , or in the synthetic , folic acid form , which is found in dietary supplements .
the researchers found a statistically significant association between folate intake and lower sperm aneuploidy .
dose effect men who consumed the most folate - between 722 and 1150 micrograms a day - had 20-30 % lower levels of several types of aneuploidy than men with low folate intake .
the story so far suggests that dietary factors wo n't help you make any more sperm , but good diet might just improve the quality of the ones that are made dr allan pacey university of sheffield the researchers stressed they had not proved that folate had a direct impact on sperm quality , merely that there was an association between the two .
they say more work is needed to investigate cause and effect .
researcher professor brenda eskenazi said while the importance of maternal diet on reproduction was well known , the research suggested paternal diet might also be important .
she said : " in previous studies , we and others have shown that paternal micronutrient intake may contribute to successful conceptions by improving the quality of the sperm .
" this study is the first to suggest that paternal diet may play a role after conception in the development of healthy offspring . "
professor eskenazi said that if the findings were confirmed the current recommended daily folate intake for men of 400 micrograms might have to be revised upwards for men trying for a baby in order to reduce the risk of chromosomal abnormalities in their children .
mounting evidence dr allan pacey , an expert in male reproduction at the university of sheffield , said evidence was mounting that diet affected sperm quality .
" the story so far suggests that dietary factors wo n't help you make any more sperm , but good diet might just improve the quality of the ones that are made . "
but he added : " before couples run out to the chemist and stock up on supplements , i would suggest that they just lead sensible lives and stop smoking , moderate alcohol intake and eat sensibly , making sure they get their five portions of fresh fruit and veg each day .
" and because it takes three months to produce sperm , any lifestyle changes should take place well in advance of any attempt to conceive . "
a decision on whether folic acid should be added to bread and flour in the uk is due next year .
campaigners say it would significantly cut the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida , but those against the move say some research has raised concerns that folic acid may be linked to an increased risk of cancer .

researcher professor brenda eskenazi said while the importance of maternal diet on reproduction was well known , the research suggested paternal diet might also be important .
she said : " in previous studies , we and others have shown that paternal micronutrient intake may contribute to successful conceptions by improving the quality of the sperm .
" this study is the first to suggest that paternal diet may play a role after conception in the development of healthy offspring . "
professor eskenazi said that if the findings were confirmed the current recommended daily folate intake for men of 400 micrograms might have to be revised upwards for men trying for a baby in order to reduce the risk of chromosomal abnormalities in their children .
mounting evidence dr allan pacey , an expert in male reproduction at the university of sheffield , said evidence was mounting that diet affected sperm quality .
" the story so far suggests that dietary factors wo n't help you make any more sperm , but good diet might just improve the quality of the ones that are made . "
but he added : " before couples run out to the chemist and stock up on supplements , i would suggest that they just lead sensible lives and stop smoking , moderate alcohol intake and eat sensibly , making sure they get their five portions of fresh fruit and veg each day .
" and because it takes three months to produce sperm , any lifestyle changes should take place well in advance of any attempt to conceive . "
a decision on whether folic acid should be added to bread and flour in the uk is due next year .
campaigners say it would significantly cut the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida , but those against the move say some research has raised concerns that folic acid may be linked to an increased risk of cancer .

abdulghappar turkistani , 35 , is one of a group of 17 chinese muslims who have been held at the us camp for six years .
lawyers for the group say they have been approved for release by the us authorities but can not return to china for fear of persecution .
efforts to find a country to take the group have so far come to nothing .
the uighurs , who are ethnic turkic muslims , come from xinjiang province , where china meets central asia .
uighur activists are seeking autonomy from china and there are sporadic outbreaks of violence in the province .
beijing accuses the activists of links to international terrorism networks .
' metal box ' mr turkistani wrote the letter on behalf of his fellow uighurs in december .

he had developed rheumatism and another uighur was being force-fed twice a day after joining a hunger strike , he said .
mr turkistani said that the group - who were told that they would be freed by us military authorities in 2004 and 2005 - did not know why they were still being held .
" we fail to know why we are still in jail here , " he said .
" we are still in hope that the us government will free us soon and send us to a safe place . "
his lawyer , seema saifee , said that the group were seeking resettlement in the us or europe .
in the meantime , she said , they were being held in solitary confinement for 22 hours per day , with " hardly any means of communicating with each other " .
a spokesman for the detention centre defended conditions at camp six , calling it a " a state-of-the-market detention facility " .
five uighurs were freed from guantanamo bay in mid-2006 and sent to albania .
about 275 inmates remain at the detention camp in cuba .

abdulghappar turkistani , 35 , is one of a group of 17 chinese muslims who have been held at the us camp for six years .
lawyers for the group say they have been approved for release by the us authorities but can not return to china for fear of persecution .
efforts to find a country to take the group have so far come to nothing .
the uighurs , who are ethnic turkic muslims , come from xinjiang province , where china meets central asia .
uighur activists are seeking autonomy from china and there are sporadic outbreaks of violence in the province .
beijing accuses the activists of links to international terrorism networks .
' metal box ' mr turkistani wrote the letter on behalf of his fellow uighurs in december .
us authorities recently cleared it for release .

china 's uighurs ethnically turkic muslims , mainly in xinjiang made bid for independent state in 1940s sporadic violence in xinjiang since 1991 uighurs worried about chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture " being away from family , away from our homeland ... being forbidden from the natural sunlight , natural air , being surrounded with a metal box all around , is not suitable for a human being , " he said .
he had developed rheumatism and another uighur was being force-fed twice a day after joining a hunger strike , he said .
mr turkistani said that the group - who were told that they would be freed by us military authorities in 2004 and 2005 - did not know why they were still being held .
" we fail to know why we are still in jail here , " he said .
" we are still in hope that the us government will free us soon and send us to a safe place . "
his lawyer , seema saifee , said that the group were seeking resettlement in the us or europe .
in the meantime , she said , they were being held in solitary confinement for 22 hours per day , with " hardly any means of communicating with each other " .
a spokesman for the detention centre defended conditions at camp six , calling it a " a state-of-the-market detention facility " .
five uighurs were freed from guantanamo bay in mid-2006 and sent to albania .
